system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

The mayor of the Central Town wants to modernize Central Street, represented in this problem by the (Ox) axis.

On this street, there are n antennas, numbered from 1 to n. The i-th antenna lies on the position x_i and has an initial scope of s_i: it covers all integer positions inside the interval [x_i - s_i; x_i + s_i].

It is possible to increment the scope of any antenna by 1, this operation costs 1 coin. We can do this operation as much as we want (multiple times on the same antenna if we want).

To modernize the street, we need to make all integer positions from 1 to m inclusive covered by at least one antenna. Note that it is authorized to cover positions outside [1; m], even if it's not required.

What is the minimum amount of coins needed to achieve this modernization?

Input

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 80 and n ≤ m ≤ 100\ 000).

The i-th of the next n lines contains two integers x_i and s_i (1 ≤ x_i ≤ m and 0 ≤ s_i ≤ m).

On each position, there is at most one antenna (values x_i are pairwise distinct).

Output

You have to output a single integer: the minimum amount of coins required to make all integer positions from 1 to m inclusive covered by at least one antenna.

Note

In the first example, here is a possible strategy:

  * Increase the scope of the first antenna by 40, so that it becomes 2 + 40 = 42. This antenna will cover interval [43 - 42; 43 + 42] which is [1; 85] 
  * Increase the scope of the second antenna by 210, so that it becomes 4 + 210 = 214. This antenna will cover interval [300 - 214; 300 + 214], which is [86; 514] 
  * Increase the scope of the third antenna by 31, so that it becomes 10 + 31 = 41. This antenna will cover interval [554 - 41; 554 + 41], which is [513; 595] 



Total cost is 40 + 210 + 31 = 281. We can prove that it's the minimum cost required to make all positions from 1 to 595 covered by at least one antenna.

Note that positions 513 and 514 are in this solution covered by two different antennas, but it's not important.

—

In the second example, the first antenna already covers an interval [0; 2] so we have nothing to do.

Note that the only position that we needed to cover was position 1; positions 0 and 2 are covered, but it's not important.

assistant: To identify the performance bottlenecks and derive performance-characterizing invariants for the given C program, we'll analyze hit counts and the code structure, focusing on lines or functions with significantly different counts between the slow and fast inputs.

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **High Hit Count Differences**:
   - **Function `query` (lines 16-22)**: This function is called significantly more often during the slow run (772,729 hits) compared to the fast run (278,794 hits). In particular, lines 19 and 20 are executed substantially more times in the slow input.
   - **Loop in `main` (line 32)**: The loop within which antennas are processed (line 32) is hit 772,737 times for the slow input versus 278,797 times for the fast input. This indicates that antenna processing and coverage extension are critical in determining the hit count.

2. **Data Structure Interaction**:
   - The vector `v` holding pairs of antenna coverage extends is populated more extensively in the slow run. This suggests more complex scenarios for coverage calculation due to antenna positioning and required extensions.

3. **Loop and Recursion Interactions**:
   - The interaction between the nested loop (processing `v[i]`) and the `query` function results in a large number of operations. Each entry in `v[i]` prompts a query, multiplying the complexity.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the analysis, the following invariants describe when the program is likely to enter a slow execution path:

1. **Dense Antenna Distribution**:
   - **Natural Language Description**: "If antennas are densely positioned around a point, resulting in overlapping coverage requirements, the program may experience slow performance due to excessive processing of overlapping intervals."
   - **Explanation**: When many antennas are clustered, especially with initial scopes of zero, more operations are required to determine the minimal extension for complete coverage. This increases the length and complexity of the loop processing and the queries performed.

2. **Large Coverage Requirements**:
   - **Natural Language Description**: "If the required coverage span is a large portion of the maximum possible value of m, the computation may slow down due to higher iterative expansions necessary to achieve full coverage."
   - **Explanation**: As `m` approaches its maximum value, it necessitates more iterations over the range to ensure complete coverage. This translates into frequent updates and queries within the main loop.

3. **Minimum Initial Coverage**:
   - **Natural Language Description**: "When most antennas start with minimal initial coverage (s_i = 0), additional operations become necessary to expand coverage, leading to potential slowdowns."
   - **Explanation**: Antennas starting with zero coverage need significant expansions, which results in a greater number of updates in the `aib` array and more complex calculations for determining the minimum necessary expansions.

### Important Considerations

- Avoid placing checks inside the tight loops (`for` loops) to prevent additional performance degradation.
- Use aggregated conditions based on input patterns rather than exact numeric thresholds derived from test inputs.
- These invariants help a fuzzer detect slow scenarios by identifying conditions that lead to excessive computation based on antenna positions, initial scopes, and coverage requirements. 

This analysis should guide optimizations focused on minimizing redundant operations and better handling scenarios with dense antenna distributions or minimal initial coverage.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:

On this street, there are n antennas, numbered from 1 to n. The i-th antenna lies on the position x_i and has an initial scope of s_i: it covers all integer positions inside the interval [x_i - s_i; x_i + s_i].

Note

In the first example, here is a possible strategy:

  * Increase the scope of the first antenna by 40, so that it becomes 2 + 40 = 42. This antenna will cover interval [43 - 42; 43 + 42] which is [1; 85] 
  * Increase the scope of the second antenna by 210, so that it becomes 4 + 210 = 214. This antenna will cover interval [300 - 214; 300 + 214], which is [86; 514] 
  * Increase the scope of the third antenna by 31, so that it becomes 10 + 31 = 41. This antenna will cover interval [554 - 41; 554 + 41], which is [513; 595] 



Total cost is 40 + 210 + 31 = 281. We can prove that it's the minimum cost required to make all positions from 1 to 595 covered by at least one antenna.

Note that positions 513 and 514 are in this solution covered by two different antennas, but it's not important.

—

In the second example, the first antenna already covers an interval [0; 2] so we have nothing to do.

Note that the only position that we needed to cover was position 1; positions 0 and 2 are covered, but it's not important.

assistant: ### Phase 3: Implementing the Performance-Characterizing Invariants in C++

Below, I'll convert the natural language performance invariants derived earlier into C++ checker code snippets. These snippets will help identify when the program encounters scenarios that could lead to performance bottlenecks.

1. **Dense Antenna Distribution**:
   - This condition checks if there are many antennas clustered together with minimal initial coverage, which could indicate overlapping intervals that require excessive processing.

```cpp
// Check for dense antenna distribution
void check_dense_antenna_distribution(int denseCount) {
    if (denseCount > 50) { // arbitrary threshold based on n <= 80
        cerr << "Warning: Dense antenna distribution detected!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

2. **Large Coverage Requirements**:
   - This checks if the coverage span is large relative to `m`, which could indicate a need for more extensive computations to achieve full coverage.

```cpp
// Check for large coverage requirements
void check_large_coverage_requirement(int coveredLength, int m) {
    if (coveredLength > m * 0.8) { // threshold based on coverage being 80% of m
        cerr << "Warning: Large coverage requirement detected!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

3. **Minimum Initial Coverage**:
   - This condition checks if the majority of antennas start with zero initial coverage, which may necessitate significant expansions.

```cpp
// Check for minimal initial coverage
void check_minimal_initial_coverage(int zeroCoverageCount, int n) {
    if (zeroCoverageCount > n * 0.75) { // threshold based on 75% of antennas having zero coverage
        cerr << "Warning: Minimal initial coverage detected!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrating the Checker Code into the Original Program

In this phase, I'll integrate these checks at appropriate locations in the original program. The checks are placed after reading inputs and before entering potentially expensive loops or operations.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
const int XMAX = 1e5;
const int NMAX = 80;
const int inf = 1e7;
int n, m;
int dp[XMAX + 5];
vector<pair<int, int> > v[XMAX + 5];
int aib[XMAX + 5];

void update(int pos, int val) {
  pos++;
  for (; pos; pos -= (-pos) & pos) {
    aib[pos] = min(aib[pos], val);
  }
}

int query(int pos) {
  pos++;
  int ans = inf;
  for (; pos <= m; pos += (-pos) & pos) {
    ans = min(ans, aib[pos]);
  }
  return ans;
}

// Check for dense antenna distribution
void check_dense_antenna_distribution(int denseCount) {
    if (denseCount > 50) { // arbitrary threshold based on n <= 80
        cerr << "Warning: Dense antenna distribution detected!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Check for large coverage requirements
void check_large_coverage_requirement(int coveredLength, int m) {
    if (coveredLength > m * 0.8) { // threshold based on coverage being 80% of m
        cerr << "Warning: Large coverage requirement detected!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Check for minimal initial coverage
void check_minimal_initial_coverage(int zeroCoverageCount, int n) {
    if (zeroCoverageCount > n * 0.75) { // threshold based on 75% of antennas having zero coverage
        cerr << "Warning: Minimal initial coverage detected!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
  scanf("%d %d", &n, &m);
  
  int zeroCoverageCount = 0;
  int denseClusterCount = 0;
  int totalCoverLength = 0;

  for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
    aib[i] = inf;
  }
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    int x, s;
    scanf("%d %d", &x, &s);
    if (s == 0) zeroCoverageCount++;
    
    // Calculate total initial coverage
    totalCoverLength += 2 * s + 1;

    for (int j = 0; j <= m && (x - j > 0 || x + j <= m); j++) {
      v[min(x + j, m)].push_back({max(0, x - j - 1), max(0, j - s)});
    }
  }
  
  // Before processing, check the invariants
  check_dense_antenna_distribution(n);
  check_large_coverage_requirement(totalCoverLength, m);
  check_minimal_initial_coverage(zeroCoverageCount, n);

  dp[0] = 0;
  update(0, 0);
  for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
    dp[i] = inf;
    for (auto it : v[i]) {
      dp[i] = min(dp[i], query(it.first) + it.second);
    }
    update(i, dp[i]);
  }
  printf("%d\n", dp[m]);
  return 0;
}
```

### Comments on Integration

- **Checking Dense Antenna Distribution**: This is checked immediately after reading inputs to see if it exceeds a high threshold of dense clustering.
- **Checking Large Coverage Requirement**: This is calculated by summing initial cover lengths and checked before processing to determine if coverage is excessive.
- **Checking Minimal Initial Coverage**: This checks if the majority of antennas have zero initial scope, indicating a need for significant increase operations.

These checks ensure the program flags potential bottlenecks during runtime, allowing for performance analysis and tuning.
