system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

The mayor of the Central Town wants to modernize Central Street, represented in this problem by the (Ox) axis.

On this street, there are n antennas, numbered from 1 to n. The i-th antenna lies on the position x_i and has an initial scope of s_i: it covers all integer positions inside the interval [x_i - s_i; x_i + s_i].

It is possible to increment the scope of any antenna by 1, this operation costs 1 coin. We can do this operation as much as we want (multiple times on the same antenna if we want).

To modernize the street, we need to make all integer positions from 1 to m inclusive covered by at least one antenna. Note that it is authorized to cover positions outside [1; m], even if it's not required.

What is the minimum amount of coins needed to achieve this modernization?

Input

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 80 and n ≤ m ≤ 100\ 000).

The i-th of the next n lines contains two integers x_i and s_i (1 ≤ x_i ≤ m and 0 ≤ s_i ≤ m).

On each position, there is at most one antenna (values x_i are pairwise distinct).

Output

You have to output a single integer: the minimum amount of coins required to make all integer positions from 1 to m inclusive covered by at least one antenna.

Note

In the first example, here is a possible strategy:

  * Increase the scope of the first antenna by 40, so that it becomes 2 + 40 = 42. This antenna will cover interval [43 - 42; 43 + 42] which is [1; 85] 
  * Increase the scope of the second antenna by 210, so that it becomes 4 + 210 = 214. This antenna will cover interval [300 - 214; 300 + 214], which is [86; 514] 
  * Increase the scope of the third antenna by 31, so that it becomes 10 + 31 = 41. This antenna will cover interval [554 - 41; 554 + 41], which is [513; 595] 



Total cost is 40 + 210 + 31 = 281. We can prove that it's the minimum cost required to make all positions from 1 to 595 covered by at least one antenna.

Note that positions 513 and 514 are in this solution covered by two different antennas, but it's not important.

—

In the second example, the first antenna already covers an interval [0; 2] so we have nothing to do.

Note that the only position that we needed to cover was position 1; positions 0 and 2 are covered, but it's not important.

assistant: To address the problem of performance bottlenecks in the given C program, we will analyze the provided hit count data to identify sections that are contributing to slow execution. This process will involve comparing the hit counts between the slow and fast runs and forming natural language invariants that describe conditions causing the code to slow down.

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Investigate Hit Counts:**
   - The `solve` function (lines 14-35) is invoked 1237 times during the fast execution and seems to be the key recursive function performing the computation.
   - However, during the slow run, the program significantly slows down, though the exact hit count is not provided for the slow input in the given data.
   - Lines 27-33 (inside the `solve` function) form the core logic, iterating over antennas and calculating the additional scope required. These lines show higher activity and might be the reason for the slowdown when execution hits are higher for these operations.

2. **Analyze the Slowdown Nature:**
   - The nested loop (line 27) iterates over all antennas, and for each, it computes the additional scope required (line 32) to cover from the current position `i`. If the condition `(xv[j] < i)` (line 28) is often true, it might reduce the loop's effectiveness, but when false, it triggers further recursion (line 33).
   - Line 33, containing a recursive call to `solve`, could exponentially increase the function calls, especially when the positions `xv[j]` are close to `m` or widely spread requiring large coverage.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **Potential Slow Path Conditions:**
   - **Invariant 1:** "If the distribution of antennas results in frequent recursive calls, particularly when many antennas are positioned far from their initial coverage range or when their initial scopes are zero, the program may slow down significantly."
     - **Reasoning:** Antennas with initial zero scopes or antennas placed far from each other require more adjustments (expanding scope), leading to deeply nested recursion.
     
   - **Invariant 2:** "When multiple antennas are clustered together but have small initial scopes, a significant number of recursive calls are required to expand each antenna's scope adequately, causing slow performance."
     - **Reasoning:** Clusters mean recursive attempts to expand coverage overlap more frequently, increasing computational load.

2. **Thresholds and Conditions:**
   - Given constraints (1 ≤ n ≤ 80, n ≤ m ≤ 100,000), focus on how many antennas start with zero or minimal scope and how far `xv[j]` is from `i`.
   - **Threshold Considerations:** Since `n` is relatively small, focus on the interaction between `xv[j]` values and `s[j]`. If many `xv[j]` values are close together with minimal `s[j]`, performance hits as recursive depth and scope adjustments increase.

3. **Broad Coverage:**
   - These invariants should help anticipate future slowdowns when presented with new inputs, guiding toward performance optimizations such as restructuring recursion or caching more efficiently.

The goal of these invariants is to highlight potential pitfalls in input configuration that lead to inefficiency. They allow engineers to think about input characteristics and guide fuzzing processes for performance testing.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
The mayor of the Central Town wants to modernize Central Street, represented in this problem by the (Ox) axis.

On this street, there are n antennas, numbered from 1 to n. The i-th antenna lies on the position x_i and has an initial scope of s_i: it covers all integer positions inside the interval [x_i - s_i; x_i + s_i].

It is possible to increment the scope of any antenna by 1, this operation costs 1 coin. We can do this operation as much as we want (multiple times on the same antenna if we want).

To modernize the street, we need to make all integer positions from 1 to m inclusive covered by at least one antenna. Note that it is authorized to cover positions outside [1; m], even if it's not required.

What is the minimum amount of coins needed to achieve this modernization?

Input

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 80 and n ≤ m ≤ 100\ 000).

The i-th of the next n lines contains two integers x_i and s_i (1 ≤ x_i ≤ m and 0 ≤ s_i ≤ m).

On each position, there is at most one antenna (values x_i are pairwise distinct).

Output

You have to output a single integer: the minimum amount of coins required to make all integer positions from 1 to m inclusive covered by at least one antenna.

Note

In the first example, here is a possible strategy:

  * Increase the scope of the first antenna by 40, so that it becomes 2 + 40 = 42. This antenna will cover interval [43 - 42; 43 + 42] which is [1; 85] 
  * Increase the scope of the second antenna by 210, so that it becomes 4 + 210 = 214. This antenna will cover interval [300 - 214; 300 + 214], which is [86; 514] 
  * Increase the scope of the third antenna by 31, so that it becomes 10 + 31 = 41. This antenna will cover interval [554 - 41; 554 + 41], which is [513; 595] 



Total cost is 40 + 210 + 31 = 281. We can prove that it's the minimum cost required to make all positions from 1 to 595 covered by at least one antenna.

Note that positions 513 and 514 are in this solution covered by two different antennas, but it's not important.

—

In the second example, the first antenna already covers an interval [0; 2] so we have nothing to do.

Note that the only position that we needed to cover was position 1; positions 0 and 2 are covered, but it's not important.

Solution (C++ code):
{solution}


assistant: ### Phase 3: Implement the Natural Language Invariants in C++

To implement the previously derived performance-characterizing invariants as runtime checks, we will write C++ code snippets that reflect the conditions described. These snippets are designed to detect potential slowdowns based on the characteristics of the input data and computation patterns.

#### Invariant 1: Recursive Calls Due to Antenna Positioning

**Natural Language Invariant:**
- "If the distribution of antennas results in frequent recursive calls, particularly when many antennas are positioned far from their initial coverage range or when their initial scopes are zero, the program may slow down significantly."

**C++ Code Implementation:**

```cpp
void check_recursive_call_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered by extensive recursion due to antenna positioning!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage: check for situations with antennas far from covering range
int max_distance = 0; // Maximum distance required to cover by expanding any antenna
for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
    max_distance = max(max_distance, max(1 - (xv[i] - s[i]), m - (xv[i] + s[i])));
}
check_recursive_call_invariant(max_distance > 10000); // Arbitrary threshold for demonstration
```

#### Invariant 2: Clustering and Small Initial Scopes

**Natural Language Invariant:**
- "When multiple antennas are clustered together but have small initial scopes, a significant number of recursive calls are required to expand each antenna's scope adequately, causing slow performance."

**C++ Code Implementation:**

```cpp
void check_clustering_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to clustered antennas with small initial scopes!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Calculate clustering with small initial scopes
int small_scope_count = 0;
for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
    if (s[i] == 0 && i > 1 && abs(xv[i] - xv[i - 1]) < 1000) { // Check clustering within 1000 units
        small_scope_count++;
    }
}
check_clustering_invariant(small_scope_count > 10); // Arbitrary threshold for demonstration
```

### Phase 4: Integrate the Checkers into the Original Program

We will now integrate these checker functions into the original C++ program to ensure they are executed at appropriate points in the control flow. Here's the instrumented code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#pragma GCC optimize("O3")

const int mods[10] = {1000000007, 999999937, 999999929, 999999893, 999999883,
                      999999797, 999999761, 999999757, 999999751, 999999739};
const int mod = 1000000007;
int rand_mods[2];
const long double eps = 1e-10;
const int siz = 1e5 + 5, siz2 = 1e6 + 5, lg = 21, block = 448, block2 = 1000,
          mxv = 1e5 + 1, sqrt_mod = 31630;
const int alpha_sz = 26;
int n, m, xv[85], s[85], dp[siz];
bool cov[siz];

void check_recursive_call_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered by extensive recursion due to antenna positioning!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_clustering_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to clustered antennas with small initial scopes!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int solve(int i) {
    if (i > m) {
        return 0;
    }
    int &ret = dp[i];
    if (ret != -1) {
        return ret;
    }
    if (cov[i]) {
        return ret = solve(i + 1);
    }
    ret = INT_MAX;
    bool ent = 0;
    for (int j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
        if (xv[j] < i) {
            continue;
        }
        ent = 1;
        int added = max(xv[j] - s[j] - i, 0);
        ret = min(ret, added + solve(xv[j] + s[j] + added + 1));
    }
    return ent ? ret : (ret = m - i + 1);
}

int main() {
    scanf("%d%d", &n, &m);
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        scanf("%d%d", &xv[i], &s[i]);
        for (int j = max(xv[i] - s[i], 1); j <= min(xv[i] + s[i], m); j++) {
            cov[j] = 1;
        }
    }
    
    // Integrate performance checks
    int max_distance = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        max_distance = max(max_distance, max(1 - (xv[i] - s[i]), m - (xv[i] + s[i])));
    }
    check_recursive_call_invariant(max_distance > 10000); // Check for expansive recursive needs

    int small_scope_count = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        if (s[i] == 0 && i > 1 && abs(xv[i] - xv[i - 1]) < 1000) {
            small_scope_count++;
        }
    }
    check_clustering_invariant(small_scope_count > 10); // Check for clustering with small scopes
    
    memset(dp, -1, sizeof dp);
    printf("%d\n", solve(1));
    return 0;
}
```

#### Explanation of Integration:

- **Recursive Call Checker:** Placed after initializing `xv` and `s`, this checks for conditions that might lead to excessive recursive calls due to the positioning of antennas.
- **Clustering Checker:** Also placed after reading inputs, this checks for clusters of antennas with small initial scopes to ensure the program doesn't run into heavy recursive calls for minimal coverage gains.

These checks aid in detecting performance bottlenecks during testing or deployment, helping prevent slow execution due to problematic input configurations.
