=== Invariants Response ===
To analyze the performance bottleneck in the given C program and derive performance-characterizing invariants, let's follow the tasks outlined in the problem statement.

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Compare Line-Level Hit Counts:**
   - The outer loop on line 14 iterates `m` times, thus repeating 100,001 times (for `m = 100,000`).
   - The inner loop on line 19 iterates `n` times for each outer loop iteration, resulting in a total of 900,000 iterations for the slow input (since `8 x 100,000`).
   - Line 20 is hit 800,000 times, indicating a substantial number of checks whether each antenna covers a position `i`.
   - Line 25 is hit heavily, suggesting frequent updates to the `dp` array.

2. **Pinpoint High-Hit Lines:**
   - **Line 19**: The inner loop is executed frequently due to large `n` and `m`.
   - **Lines 20-30**: These lines perform checks and updates for each antenna and position, specifically handling conditions where the antenna's range needs incrementing.

3. **Interactions with Data Structures:**
   - The `dp` array is used to track the minimum cost to cover up to each position. It is updated based on the current antenna's coverage, which can involve multiple calculations and condition checks for each position and antenna.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the analysis of the code and hit counts, the following performance-characterizing invariants can be derived:

1. **Frequent Antenna Coverage Check:**
   - **Natural Language Invariant:** "When the number of antennas `n` is high relative to the total positions `m`, and multiple antennas have ranges that initially do not cover most of the street, the program may spend considerable time in checking and updating coverage for each position."
   - **Threshold Suggestion:** The complexity grows with `n`, which can reach up to 80, and `m`, which can reach up to 100,000. The performance degrades significantly if many antennas have small initial coverage, leading to frequent updates.

2. **Multiple Coverage Adjustments:**
   - **Natural Language Invariant:** "If many antennas initially have small coverage, requiring frequent scope adjustments to ensure full coverage of the street, the computation cost increases significantly."
   - **Threshold Suggestion:** The performance impact becomes significant when a substantial portion of antennas needs their range incremented multiple times to meet the coverage requirement for large `m`.

3. **High Frequency of DP Updates:**
   - **Natural Language Invariant:** "When the cost array `dp` is updated repeatedly for large segments of the street, especially with many antennas causing overlapping updates, the performance may degrade."
   - **Threshold Suggestion:** A high density of antennas near the critical regions (start and end of the street) that initially do not cover the required range can trigger many updates.

These invariants help characterize situations leading to slow performance without relying on specific numeric values from the slow input, focusing instead on general conditions and patterns that lead to inefficiencies.

=== Checker Response ===
Let's proceed with translating the natural language performance invariants into C++ runtime checks and then integrate these checks into the provided C++ program.

### Phase 3: Implementing the Invariants as Runtime Checks

1. **Frequent Antenna Coverage Check:**
   - **Invariant:** "When the number of antennas `n` is high relative to the total positions `m`, and multiple antennas have ranges that initially do not cover most of the street, the program may spend considerable time in checking and updating coverage for each position."
   - **C++ Code:**
     ```cpp
     void check_antenna_coverage(int n, int m, const vector<pair<int, int>>& a) {
         int uncovered_positions = 0;
         for (int pos = 1; pos <= m; ++pos) {
             bool covered = false;
             for (const auto& antenna : a) {
                 if (pos >= antenna.first - antenna.second && pos <= antenna.first + antenna.second) {
                     covered = true;
                     break;
                 }
             }
             if (!covered) ++uncovered_positions;
         }
         if (uncovered_positions > m / 2) {  // Assuming significant slowdown if more than half the positions are initially uncovered
             cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to many uncovered positions!" << endl;
             abort();
         }
     }
     ```

2. **Multiple Coverage Adjustments:**
   - **Invariant:** "If many antennas initially have small coverage, requiring frequent scope adjustments to ensure full coverage of the street, the computation cost increases significantly."
   - **C++ Code:**
     ```cpp
     void check_coverage_adjustments(const vector<pair<int, int>>& a, int m) {
         int small_coverage_count = 0;
         for (const auto& antenna : a) {
             if (antenna.second < m / 10) {  // Assume small coverage if less than a tenth of `m`
                 ++small_coverage_count;
             }
         }
         if (small_coverage_count > a.size() / 2) {  // More than half antennas with small coverage
             cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to many antennas with small initial coverage!" << endl;
             abort();
         }
     }
     ```

3. **High Frequency of DP Updates:**
   - **Invariant:** "When the cost array `dp` is updated repeatedly for large segments of the street, especially with many antennas causing overlapping updates, the performance may degrade."
   - **C++ Code:**
     ```cpp
     void check_dp_updates(int n, int m) {
         if (m > 10000 && n > 40) {  // Arbitrary threshold to detect potential performance issues
             cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to frequent DP updates for large m and n!" << endl;
             abort();
         }
     }
     ```

### Phase 4: Integrating the Checks into the Original Program

Let's integrate these checks into the provided C++ program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int dp[100005];

void check_antenna_coverage(int n, int m, const vector<pair<int, int>>& a) {
    int uncovered_positions = 0;
    for (int pos = 1; pos <= m; ++pos) {
        bool covered = false;
        for (const auto& antenna : a) {
            if (pos >= antenna.first - antenna.second && pos <= antenna.first + antenna.second) {
                covered = true;
                break;
            }
        }
        if (!covered) ++uncovered_positions;
    }
    if (uncovered_positions > m / 2) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to many uncovered positions!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_coverage_adjustments(const vector<pair<int, int>>& a, int m) {
    int small_coverage_count = 0;
    for (const auto& antenna : a) {
        if (antenna.second < m / 10) {
            ++small_coverage_count;
        }
    }
    if (small_coverage_count > a.size() / 2) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to many antennas with small initial coverage!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_dp_updates(int n, int m) {
    if (m > 10000 && n > 40) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to frequent DP updates for large m and n!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    int n, m;
    cin >> n >> m;
    vector<pair<int, int>> a(n);
    for (auto &x : a) {
        cin >> x.first >> x.second;
    }
    
    // Check for potential performance bottlenecks
    check_antenna_coverage(n, m, a);
    check_coverage_adjustments(a, m);
    check_dp_updates(n, m);
    
    sort(a.begin(), a.end());
    memset(dp, 0x3f, sizeof(dp));
    dp[m + 1] = 0;
    for (int i = m; i >= 1; i--) {
        if (i == 1) {
            int v;
            v++;
        }
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            if (a[j].first + a[j].second >= i) {
                int req = 0;
                if (a[j].first - a[j].second > i) {
                    req = a[j].first - a[j].second - i;
                }
                dp[i] = min(dp[i],
                            req + dp[min(m + 1, a[j].first + a[j].second + req + 1)]);
                if (a[j].first + a[j].second < m) {
                    req = max(req, m - (a[j].first + a[j].second));
                }
                dp[i] = min(dp[i], req);
            }
        }
    }
    cout << dp[1] << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

Each of the check functions is called after reading the input to ensure the conditions can be evaluated without adding overhead inside tight loops. The checks help identify scenarios that could lead to a performance bottleneck, providing early warnings before the program continues with potentially time-consuming operations.
