system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

The mayor of the Central Town wants to modernize Central Street, represented in this problem by the (Ox) axis.

On this street, there are n antennas, numbered from 1 to n. The i-th antenna lies on the position x_i and has an initial scope of s_i: it covers all integer positions inside the interval [x_i - s_i; x_i + s_i].

It is possible to increment the scope of any antenna by 1, this operation costs 1 coin. We can do this operation as much as we want (multiple times on the same antenna if we want).

To modernize the street, we need to make all integer positions from 1 to m inclusive covered by at least one antenna. Note that it is authorized to cover positions outside [1; m], even if it's not required.

What is the minimum amount of coins needed to achieve this modernization?

Input

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 80 and n ≤ m ≤ 100\ 000).

The i-th of the next n lines contains two integers x_i and s_i (1 ≤ x_i ≤ m and 0 ≤ s_i ≤ m).

On each position, there is at most one antenna (values x_i are pairwise distinct).

Output

You have to output a single integer: the minimum amount of coins required to make all integer positions from 1 to m inclusive covered by at least one antenna.

Note

In the first example, here is a possible strategy:

  * Increase the scope of the first antenna by 40, so that it becomes 2 + 40 = 42. This antenna will cover interval [43 - 42; 43 + 42] which is [1; 85] 
  * Increase the scope of the second antenna by 210, so that it becomes 4 + 210 = 214. This antenna will cover interval [300 - 214; 300 + 214], which is [86; 514] 
  * Increase the scope of the third antenna by 31, so that it becomes 10 + 31 = 41. This antenna will cover interval [554 - 41; 554 + 41], which is [513; 595] 



Total cost is 40 + 210 + 31 = 281. We can prove that it's the minimum cost required to make all positions from 1 to 595 covered by at least one antenna.

Note that positions 513 and 514 are in this solution covered by two different antennas, but it's not important.

—

In the second example, the first antenna already covers an interval [0; 2] so we have nothing to do.

Note that the only position that we needed to cover was position 1; positions 0 and 2 are covered, but it's not important.

assistant: ### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

Based on the line-level hit count comparison between the slow and fast input runs, here's a detailed analysis:

1. **Line 10 (Function `change`)**:
   - **Slow Input Hit Count**: 12,141,427
   - **Fast Input Hit Count**: 1,699,986
   - This function is called significantly more often for the slow input, indicating it's a major contributor to the slowdown.

2. **Line 32 (Function `ask`)**:
   - **Slow Input Hit Count**: 31,229,633
   - **Fast Input Hit Count**: 5,891,708
   - The `ask` function, which is called inside a loop, also shows a substantial increase in hits during the slow input run. This suggests it may be repeatedly querying a large range or excessive elements due to the input nature.

3. **Nested Loops (Lines 48-49)**:
   - There is a double loop here iterating over `i` from 0 to `m` and `j` from 1 to `n`. The product of these loops generates high complexities, especially when combined with the operations within them.

The slowdown is likely due to repeated calls to costly functions (`change` and `ask`) within nested loops, possibly exacerbated by the input data pattern.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Here are some natural language performance invariants derived from the analysis:

1. **Nested Loop with Large `m`**:
   - **Invariant**: "If `m` is large and the nested loops iterate over all positions from 0 to `m`, it may lead to excessive function calls within each iteration, slowing down the program."
   - **Explanation**: As `m` increases, the outer loop runs more times, and combined with the inner loop over antennas, it results in exponential growth in operations.

2. **Frequent Range Queries and Updates**:
   - **Invariant**: "When many antennas have initial scopes or positions that require frequent range updates (through `change`) and queries (through `ask`), the complexity of maintaining the segment tree increases significantly."
   - **Explanation**: The segment tree operations become more expensive when the range of coverage is large or needs frequent adjustments due to the number of updates.

3. **Scenarios of High Complexity with Zero Initial Scope**:
   - **Invariant**: "If several antennas have an initial scope of zero, causing all their ranges to be extended via operations, it leads to repeated updates and queries that can degrade performance."
   - **Explanation**: Antennas with zero initial scope require more operations to cover necessary intervals, substantially increasing computational efforts.

4. **Large Gaps Between Antennas**:
   - **Invariant**: "When there are large gaps between antennas, especially towards the end of the coverage range, more operations are needed to extend coverage to the required positions, which can lead to increased function calls."
   - **Explanation**: Large gaps necessitate more substantial coverage increases, resulting in multiple operations and delays.

These invariants aim to capture the computational inefficiencies that lead to slower performance, especially when dealing with inputs approaching or maximizing the constraints. They focus on patterns that cause excessive function calls and data structure manipulations.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
The mayor of the Central Town wants to modernize Central Street, represented in this problem by the (Ox) axis.

On this street, there are n antennas, numbered from 1 to n. The i-th antenna lies on the position x_i and has an initial scope of s_i: it covers all integer positions inside the interval [x_i - s_i; x_i + s_i].

It is possible to increment the scope of any antenna by 1, this operation costs 1 coin. We can do this operation as much as we want (multiple times on the same antenna if we want).

To modernize the street, we need to make all integer positions from 1 to m inclusive covered by at least one antenna. Note that it is authorized to cover positions outside [1; m], even if it's not required.

What is the minimum amount of coins needed to achieve this modernization?

Input

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 80 and n ≤ m ≤ 100\ 000).

The i-th of the next n lines contains two integers x_i and s_i (1 ≤ x_i ≤ m and 0 ≤ s_i ≤ m).

On each position, there is at most one antenna (values x_i are pairwise distinct).

Output

You have to output a single integer: the minimum amount of coins required to make all integer positions from 1 to m inclusive covered by at least one antenna.

Examples

Input


3 595
43 2
300 4
554 10

13 0
50 25
60 5
155 70
165 70


Output


26

Note

In the first example, here is a possible strategy:

  * Increase the scope of the first antenna by 40, so that it becomes 2 + 40 = 42. This antenna will cover interval [43 - 42; 43 + 42] which is [1; 85] 
  * Increase the scope of the second antenna by 210, so that it becomes 4 + 210 = 214. This antenna will cover interval [300 - 214; 300 + 214], which is [86; 514] 
  * Increase the scope of the third antenna by 31, so that it becomes 10 + 31 = 41. This antenna will cover interval [554 - 41; 554 + 41], which is [513; 595] 



Total cost is 40 + 210 + 31 = 281. We can prove that it's the minimum cost required to make all positions from 1 to 595 covered by at least one antenna.

Note that positions 513 and 514 are in this solution covered by two different antennas, but it's not important.

—

In the second example, the first antenna already covers an interval [0; 2] so we have nothing to do.

Note that the only position that we needed to cover was position 1; positions 0 and 2 are covered, but it's not important.

Solution (C++ code):
{solution}


assistant: ### Phase 3: Implementing Natural Language Invariants in C++

Let's transform the performance-characterizing invariants into runtime checks that can be integrated into the original C++ program.

#### Invariant 1: Nested Loop with Large `m`
```cpp
void check_large_m_nested_loops(int n, int m) {
    if (m > 50000 && n > 10) {  // Example threshold; adjust based on observed performance
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to large m and nested loops!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

#### Invariant 2: Frequent Range Queries and Updates
```cpp
void check_frequent_updates(int updateCount, int queryCount) {
    if (updateCount > 1000000 || queryCount > 2000000) {  // Example thresholds
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to frequent range updates/queries!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

#### Invariant 3: Scenarios of High Complexity with Zero Initial Scope
```cpp
void check_zero_scope_antennas(int zeroScopeCount) {
    if (zeroScopeCount > 10) {  // Example threshold
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to many antennas with zero initial scope!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

#### Invariant 4: Large Gaps Between Antennas
```cpp
void check_large_gaps(int largestGap) {
    if (largestGap > 10000) {  // Example threshold for a large gap
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to large gaps between antennas!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrating Checks into the C++ Program

Now, let's integrate these checks into the provided C++ code. We want to place the checks strategically to avoid excessive overhead.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
const int N = 2e5 + 5;
int dp[N];
int n, m, s[N], x[N];
const int inf = 0x3f3f3f3f;
struct xds {
  int mn, l, r;
} t[N << 2];

void change(int p, int l, int r, int d) {
  if (l <= t[p].l && r >= t[p].r) {
    t[p].mn = min(t[p].mn, d);
    return;
  }
  int mid = (t[p].l + t[p].r) / 2;
  if (l <= mid) change(p * 2, l, r, d);
  if (r > mid) change(p * 2 + 1, l, r, d);
  t[p].mn = min(t[p * 2].mn, t[p * 2 + 1].mn);
}

void build(int p, int l, int r) {
  t[p].l = l, t[p].r = r;
  t[p].mn = inf;
  if (l == r) {
    t[p].mn = inf;
    return;
  }
  int mid = (l + r) / 2;
  build(p * 2, l, mid);
  build(p * 2 + 1, mid + 1, r);
  t[p].mn = min(t[p * 2].mn, t[p * 2 + 1].mn);
}

long long ask(int p, int l, int r) {
  if (l <= t[p].l && r >= t[p].r) return t[p].mn;
  int mid = (t[p].l + t[p].r) / 2;
  long long val = inf;
  if (l <= mid) val = min(val, ask(p * 2, l, r));
  if (r > mid) val = min(val, ask(p * 2 + 1, l, r));
  return val;
}

// Checkers based on performance-characterizing invariants
void check_large_m_nested_loops(int n, int m) {
    if (m > 50000 && n > 10) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to large m and nested loops!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_frequent_updates(int updateCount, int queryCount) {
    if (updateCount > 1000000 || queryCount > 2000000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to frequent range updates/queries!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_zero_scope_antennas(int zeroScopeCount) {
    if (zeroScopeCount > 10) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to many antennas with zero initial scope!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_large_gaps(int largestGap) {
    if (largestGap > 10000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to large gaps between antennas!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
  cin >> n >> m;
  
  int zeroScopeCount = 0;
  int largestGap = 0;
  int previousX = 0;

  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    cin >> x[i] >> s[i];
    if (s[i] == 0) zeroScopeCount++;
    if (i > 1) largestGap = max(largestGap, x[i] - previousX);
    previousX = x[i];
  }

  // Performance checkers
  check_large_m_nested_loops(n, m);
  check_zero_scope_antennas(zeroScopeCount);
  check_large_gaps(largestGap);

  build(1, 0, m);
  change(1, 0, 0, 0);
  int mxr = 0;
  int updateCount = 0;
  int queryCount = 0;

  for (int i = 0; i <= m; i++)
    for (int j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
      int l = i + 1;
      if (x[j] < l) continue;
      int r = x[j] + x[j] - l;
      int c = x[j] - l - s[j];
      if (c < 0) r = r - c, c = 0;
      r = min(r, m);
      mxr = max(mxr, r);
      updateCount++;
      queryCount += 2;
      change(1, r, r, min(ask(1, r, r), c + ask(1, i, m)));
    }

  check_frequent_updates(updateCount, queryCount);

  long long ans = inf;
  for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
    ans = min(ans, ask(1, i, i) + m - i);
  }

  cout << ans << endl;
}
```

In this instrumented code:
- **Invariant Checkers** have been added to detect performance issues based on observed patterns.
- **Strategic Placement** ensures checks run before costly loops or after significant operations, minimizing overhead.
- **Thresholds** are examples; they could be adjusted based on additional testing and profiling data.
