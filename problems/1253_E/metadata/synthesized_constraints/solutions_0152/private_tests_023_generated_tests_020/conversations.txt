system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

The mayor of the Central Town wants to modernize Central Street, represented in this problem by the (Ox) axis.

On this street, there are n antennas, numbered from 1 to n. The i-th antenna lies on the position x_i and has an initial scope of s_i: it covers all integer positions inside the interval [x_i - s_i; x_i + s_i].

It is possible to increment the scope of any antenna by 1, this operation costs 1 coin. We can do this operation as much as we want (multiple times on the same antenna if we want).

To modernize the street, we need to make all integer positions from 1 to m inclusive covered by at least one antenna. Note that it is authorized to cover positions outside [1; m], even if it's not required.

What is the minimum amount of coins needed to achieve this modernization?

Input

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 80 and n ≤ m ≤ 100\ 000).

The i-th of the next n lines contains two integers x_i and s_i (1 ≤ x_i ≤ m and 0 ≤ s_i ≤ m).

On each position, there is at most one antenna (values x_i are pairwise distinct).

Output

You have to output a single integer: the minimum amount of coins required to make all integer positions from 1 to m inclusive covered by at least one antenna.

Note

In the first example, here is a possible strategy:

  * Increase the scope of the first antenna by 40, so that it becomes 2 + 40 = 42. This antenna will cover interval [43 - 42; 43 + 42] which is [1; 85] 
  * Increase the scope of the second antenna by 210, so that it becomes 4 + 210 = 214. This antenna will cover interval [300 - 214; 300 + 214], which is [86; 514] 
  * Increase the scope of the third antenna by 31, so that it becomes 10 + 31 = 41. This antenna will cover interval [554 - 41; 554 + 41], which is [513; 595] 



Total cost is 40 + 210 + 31 = 281. We can prove that it's the minimum cost required to make all positions from 1 to 595 covered by at least one antenna.

Note that positions 513 and 514 are in this solution covered by two different antennas, but it's not important.

—

In the second example, the first antenna already covers an interval [0; 2] so we have nothing to do.

Note that the only position that we needed to cover was position 1; positions 0 and 2 are covered, but it's not important.

assistant: Based on the provided data, let’s analyze the performance characteristics of the given C program and derive natural language invariants from the analysis.

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Line-Level Hit Count Analysis**:
   - The `dp` function (line 8) is called significantly more times in the slow input (100,010 hits) compared to the fast input (1,237 hits).
   - The recursive calls and memoization checks (lines 10 and 11) are also more frequent in the slow input, indicating that the recursion depth or the number of uncovered positions is much higher.
   - Lines involved in for-loop processing (lines 12-17) have similar relative differences; they get more hits under the slow input.

2. **Data Structure and Loop Interaction**:
   - The `filled[i]` array is checked extensively but may frequently find positions uncovered, leading to deep or repeated recursion, especially when large contiguous segments of the street remain uncovered by any initial antenna range.
   - The high hit count on `dp` (line 8) suggests that the recursion is processing many positions, potentially due to the initial antenna ranges not covering large sections of the required range, leading to more recursive depth to cover these gaps.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the above analysis, here are the potential performance-characterizing invariants:

1. **Recursive Coverage Saturation**:
   - **Invariant**: "If large contiguous segments of the street initially remain uncovered by any antenna, the recursive depth of exploration increases significantly, causing slow execution."
   - **Explanation**: When initial coverage is sparse—where antennas do not initially cover large parts of [1, m]—the recursion must explore many possibilities to extend coverage, leading to performance degradation.

2. **Inefficient Memoization Usage**:
   - **Invariant**: "If the memoization cache (`memo[i]`) frequently encounters uncovered positions, the function enters into a costly recursion to find minimal coverage extensions."
   - **Explanation**: Frequent checks for uncovered positions suggest inefficiencies in how coverage is attempted to be extended, especially if the memoization does not hit many pre-filled values.

3. **Non-optimal Initial Placement**:
   - **Invariant**: "If initial placements of antennas do not provide overlapping coverage that efficiently covers the range [1, m], the cost to adjust and extend coverage increases, leading to more recursion."
   - **Explanation**: Antennas that do not cover or provide buffer zones between them, particularly towards the start of the range [1, m], require more recursive operations to close these gaps.

4. **High Initial Uncovered Range**:
   - **Invariant**: "If the range from position 1 to m has a high initial uncovered length (i.e., large gaps between initial antenna ranges), the recursion to find the minimal extension cost becomes more expensive."
   - **Explanation**: Large initial gaps necessitate a large number of recursive calls to calculate minimal coverage extensions, thus increasing computational load.

### Conclusion

These invariants help to identify conditions that trigger slow execution. They focus on scenarios where either initial conditions are sub-optimal (leading to more recursive calculations) or the way coverage is adapted dynamically is inefficient. These insights can guide future optimizations or help testing frameworks (like fuzzers) identify problematic input patterns efficiently.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
The mayor of the Central Town wants to modernize Central Street, represented in this problem by the (Ox) axis.

On this street, there are n antennas, numbered from 1 to n. The i-th antenna lies on the position x_i and has an initial scope of s_i: it covers all integer positions inside the interval [x_i - s_i; x_i + s_i].

It is possible to increment the scope of any antenna by 1, this operation costs 1 coin. We can do this operation as much as we want (multiple times on the same antenna if we want).

To modernize the street, we need to make all integer positions from 1 to m inclusive covered by at least one antenna. Note that it is authorized to cover positions outside [1; m], even if it's not required.

What is the minimum amount of coins needed to achieve this modernization?

Input

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 80 and n ≤ m ≤ 100\ 000).

The i-th of the next n lines contains two integers x_i and s_i (1 ≤ x_i ≤ m and 0 ≤ s_i ≤ m).

On each position, there is at most one antenna (values x_i are pairwise distinct).

Output

You have to output a single integer: the minimum amount of coins required to make all integer positions from 1 to m inclusive covered by at least one antenna.

Note

In the first example, here is a possible strategy:

  * Increase the scope of the first antenna by 40, so that it becomes 2 + 40 = 42. This antenna will cover interval [43 - 42; 43 + 42] which is [1; 85] 
  * Increase the scope of the second antenna by 210, so that it becomes 4 + 210 = 214. This antenna will cover interval [300 - 214; 300 + 214], which is [86; 514] 
  * Increase the scope of the third antenna by 31, so that it becomes 10 + 31 = 41. This antenna will cover interval [554 - 41; 554 + 41], which is [513; 595] 



Total cost is 40 + 210 + 31 = 281. We can prove that it's the minimum cost required to make all positions from 1 to 595 covered by at least one antenna.

Note that positions 513 and 514 are in this solution covered by two different antennas, but it's not important.

—

In the second example, the first antenna already covers an interval [0; 2] so we have nothing to do.

Note that the only position that we needed to cover was position 1; positions 0 and 2 are covered, but it's not important.

Solution (C++ code):
{solution}


assistant: ### Phase 3: Implementing Natural Language Invariants as C++ Checkers

Based on the performance-characterizing invariants identified previously, here are the C++ checker implementations:

```cpp
// Checker for Recursive Coverage Saturation
void check_recursive_coverage_invariant(int uncoveredSegments) {
    if (uncoveredSegments > 1000) {  // Arbitrary threshold for large uncovered segments
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to large uncovered segments!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Checker for Inefficient Memoization Usage
void check_memoization_invariant(int unfilledCount) {
    if (unfilledCount > 5000) {  // Threshold for inefficient memoization usage
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to inefficient memoization usage!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Checker for Non-optimal Initial Placement
void check_initial_placement_invariant(int initialCoverageLength) {
    if (initialCoverageLength < m / 10) {  // Threshold for non-optimal initial placement
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to non-optimal initial placement!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrate Checkers with the Original Program

Here is the revised C++ code with integrated runtime checkers:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int n, m;
int pos[100];
int range[100];
bool filled[100005];
int memo[100005];

// Checker functions
void check_recursive_coverage_invariant(int uncoveredSegments) {
    if (uncoveredSegments > 1000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to large uncovered segments!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_memoization_invariant(int unfilledCount) {
    if (unfilledCount > 5000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to inefficient memoization usage!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_initial_placement_invariant(int initialCoverageLength) {
    if (initialCoverageLength < m / 10) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to non-optimal initial placement!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int dp(int i) {
    if (i > m) return 0;
    if (memo[i] != -1) return memo[i];
    if (filled[i]) return memo[i] = dp(i + 1);

    int ans = m - i + 1;
    int diff;

    for (int x = 0; x < n; x++) {
        if (i < pos[x] - range[x]) {
            diff = pos[x] - range[x] - i;
            ans = min(ans, diff + dp(pos[x] + range[x] + diff + 1));
        }
    }
    return memo[i] = ans;
}

int main() {
    scanf("%d%d", &n, &m);
    int initialCoverage = 0;

    for (int x = 0; x < n; x++) {
        scanf("%d%d", &pos[x], &range[x]);
        for (int y = max(1, pos[x] - range[x]); y <= min(m, pos[x] + range[x]); y++) {
            filled[y] = true;
        }
        initialCoverage += min(m, pos[x] + range[x]) - max(1, pos[x] - range[x]) + 1;
    }

    // Perform initial placement check
    check_initial_placement_invariant(initialCoverage);

    // Count initially uncovered segments
    int uncoveredSegments = 0;
    int unfilledCount = 0;

    for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
        if (!filled[i]) {
            unfilledCount++;
            if (i == 1 || filled[i - 1]) {
                uncoveredSegments++;
            }
        }
    }

    // Perform memoization invariant check
    check_memoization_invariant(unfilledCount);
    // Perform recursive coverage invariant check
    check_recursive_coverage_invariant(uncoveredSegments);

    memset(memo, -1, sizeof(memo));
    printf("%d\n", dp(1));
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Checker Integration**: 
   - Checkers are placed strategically where they can evaluate the condition without being in a tight loop.
   - `check_initial_placement_invariant` is called after setting up initial coverage to assess how well the initial setup covers the range.
   - `check_memoization_invariant` and `check_recursive_coverage_invariant` are called before the main computation to assess potential inefficiencies.
   
2. **Thresholds**: 
   - Thresholds are set based on the problem constraints and anticipated bottlenecks. These can be adjusted as more performance data becomes available.

3. **Utility**: 
   - These checks should help quickly identify inputs that lead to poor performance, serving as useful diagnostics for a fuzzer or during manual testing.
