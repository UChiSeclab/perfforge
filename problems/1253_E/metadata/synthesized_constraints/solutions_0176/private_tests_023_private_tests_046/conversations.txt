system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

The mayor of the Central Town wants to modernize Central Street, represented in this problem by the (Ox) axis.

On this street, there are n antennas, numbered from 1 to n. The i-th antenna lies on the position x_i and has an initial scope of s_i: it covers all integer positions inside the interval [x_i - s_i; x_i + s_i].

It is possible to increment the scope of any antenna by 1, this operation costs 1 coin. We can do this operation as much as we want (multiple times on the same antenna if we want).

To modernize the street, we need to make all integer positions from 1 to m inclusive covered by at least one antenna. Note that it is authorized to cover positions outside [1; m], even if it's not required.

What is the minimum amount of coins needed to achieve this modernization?

Input

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 80 and n ≤ m ≤ 100\ 000).

The i-th of the next n lines contains two integers x_i and s_i (1 ≤ x_i ≤ m and 0 ≤ s_i ≤ m).

On each position, there is at most one antenna (values x_i are pairwise distinct).

Output

You have to output a single integer: the minimum amount of coins required to make all integer positions from 1 to m inclusive covered by at least one antenna.

Note

In the first example, here is a possible strategy:

  * Increase the scope of the first antenna by 40, so that it becomes 2 + 40 = 42. This antenna will cover interval [43 - 42; 43 + 42] which is [1; 85] 
  * Increase the scope of the second antenna by 210, so that it becomes 4 + 210 = 214. This antenna will cover interval [300 - 214; 300 + 214], which is [86; 514] 
  * Increase the scope of the third antenna by 31, so that it becomes 10 + 31 = 41. This antenna will cover interval [554 - 41; 554 + 41], which is [513; 595] 



Total cost is 40 + 210 + 31 = 281. We can prove that it's the minimum cost required to make all positions from 1 to 595 covered by at least one antenna.

Note that positions 513 and 514 are in this solution covered by two different antennas, but it's not important.

—

In the second example, the first antenna already covers an interval [0; 2] so we have nothing to do.

Note that the only position that we needed to cover was position 1; positions 0 and 2 are covered, but it's not important.

assistant: ### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

The following lines have significantly higher hit counts in the slow input compared to the fast input:

1. **Lines 21-24**: The loop iterating over `j` from 1 to `M` shows an enormous difference in hit counts. This indicates that the loop over possible coverage positions is a major contributor to the slowdown.
2. **Lines 25-33**: These lines are executed within the inner loop and have high hit counts, suggesting that the calculations related to `ldelta`, `rdelta`, and updates to `dp[i][j]` are central to the performance issues.
3. **Lines 36-39**: The backward loop that calculates the `suffix_min` array also sees a large number of hits, especially on lines 37 and 39.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the hit count analysis and understanding of the code logic, here are potential performance-characterizing invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down:

1. **Broad Coverage Requirement**: 
   - **Invariant**: "When the target coverage range `M` is large relative to the initial coverage ranges of the antennas, the program must iterate over many positions, leading to increased execution time."
   - This relates to the large hit counts of the loops that iterate over `j` from 1 to `M`, especially when `M` is large.

2. **Sparse Initial Antenna Placement**:
   - **Invariant**: "If initial antenna placements are sparse or concentrated in a small region, additional iterations are required to increment their scopes sufficiently to cover the entire range from 1 to `M`."
   - This is inferred from the high hit counts observed in the loops and conditional checks, indicating more operations are needed when initial coverage is insufficient.

3. **High Antenna Count with Minimal Initial Coverage**:
   - **Invariant**: "When there are many antennas but each has a minimal initial scope, the algorithm must perform more increments, leading to increased loop executions and slower performance."
   - This condition causes repeated execution of the scope increment logic within loops, as seen in the hit counts.

4. **Frequent Updates to `dp` and `suffix_min`**:
   - **Invariant**: "High updates to the `dp` and `suffix_min` arrays, especially when the positions exceed a threshold that significantly increases computation, can be a bottleneck."
   - The large number of updates seen in the hit counts for lines handling the `dp` and `suffix_min` arrays suggest that inefficient handling or computation of these entries leads to performance issues.

These invariants are designed to abstract away from specific numbers in the slow input, instead focusing on the general conditions and patterns that cause the slowdown. They take the problem constraints into account, ensuring that they apply broadly and can help anticipate possible future slow scenarios.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
The mayor of the Central Town wants to modernize Central Street, represented in this problem by the (Ox) axis.

On this street, there are n antennas, numbered from 1 to n. The i-th antenna lies on the position x_i and has an initial scope of s_i: it covers all integer positions inside the interval [x_i - s_i; x_i + s_i].

It is possible to increment the scope of any antenna by 1, this operation costs 1 coin. We can do this operation as much as we want (multiple times on the same antenna if we want).

To modernize the street, we need to make all integer positions from 1 to m inclusive covered by at least one antenna. Note that it is authorized to cover positions outside [1; m], even if it's not required.

What is the minimum amount of coins needed to achieve this modernization?

Input

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 80 and n ≤ m ≤ 100\ 000).

The i-th of the next n lines contains two integers x_i and s_i (1 ≤ x_i ≤ m and 0 ≤ s_i ≤ m).

On each position, there is at most one antenna (values x_i are pairwise distinct).

Output

You have to output a single integer: the minimum amount of coins required to make all integer positions from 1 to m inclusive covered by at least one antenna.

Note

In the first example, here is a possible strategy:

  * Increase the scope of the first antenna by 40, so that it becomes 2 + 40 = 42. This antenna will cover interval [43 - 42; 43 + 42] which is [1; 85] 
  * Increase the scope of the second antenna by 210, so that it becomes 4 + 210 = 214. This antenna will cover interval [300 - 214; 300 + 214], which is [86; 514] 
  * Increase the scope of the third antenna by 31, so that it becomes 10 + 31 = 41. This antenna will cover interval [554 - 41; 554 + 41], which is [513; 595] 



Total cost is 40 + 210 + 31 = 281. We can prove that it's the minimum cost required to make all positions from 1 to 595 covered by at least one antenna.

Note that positions 513 and 514 are in this solution covered by two different antennas, but it's not important.

—

In the second example, the first antenna already covers an interval [0; 2] so we have nothing to do.

Note that the only position that we needed to cover was position 1; positions 0 and 2 are covered, but it's not important.

Solution (C++ code):
{solution}


assistant: ### Phase 3: Implementing the Natural Language Invariants in C++

Here are the checker functions based on the performance-characterizing invariants derived earlier:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

// Checker for broad coverage requirement
void check_broad_coverage_invariant(int M, int total_initial_coverage) {
    if (total_initial_coverage < M / 2) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck triggered - large M relative to initial coverage!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Checker for sparse initial antenna placement
void check_sparse_antenna_invariant(int N, int M, const vector<pair<int, int>>& ants) {
    if (N < M / 1000) {  // Arbitrary threshold for sparsity, adjust as necessary
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck triggered - sparse initial antenna placement!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Checker for high antenna count with minimal initial coverage
void check_high_antenna_count_invariant(int N, int M, const vector<pair<int, int>>& ants) {
    int minimal_coverage_count = 0;
    for (const auto& ant : ants) {
        if (ant.second < M / 1000) {  // Arbitrary threshold for minimal coverage
            minimal_coverage_count++;
        }
    }
    if (minimal_coverage_count > N / 2) {  // More than half have minimal coverage
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck triggered - many antennas with minimal initial coverage!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Checker for frequent updates in dp and suffix_min
void check_frequent_updates_invariant(int N, int M) {
    long long maximum_operations = (long long)N * M;  // Conservative estimate
    if (maximum_operations > 1e8) {  // Arbitrary threshold for number of operations
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck triggered - frequent updates to dp/suffix_min arrays!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrating Checks into the Original C++ Program

Below is the modified version of the provided C++ program with the integrated invariant checks:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

void check_broad_coverage_invariant(int M, int total_initial_coverage) {
    if (total_initial_coverage < M / 2) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck triggered - large M relative to initial coverage!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_sparse_antenna_invariant(int N, int M, const vector<pair<int, int>>& ants) {
    if (N < M / 1000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck triggered - sparse initial antenna placement!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_high_antenna_count_invariant(int N, int M, const vector<pair<int, int>>& ants) {
    int minimal_coverage_count = 0;
    for (const auto& ant : ants) {
        if (ant.second < M / 1000) {
            minimal_coverage_count++;
        }
    }
    if (minimal_coverage_count > N / 2) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck triggered - many antennas with minimal initial coverage!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_frequent_updates_invariant(int N, int M) {
    long long maximum_operations = (long long)N * M;
    if (maximum_operations > 1e8) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck triggered - frequent updates to dp/suffix_min arrays!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(0);
    cout.tie(0);
    int N, M;
    cin >> N >> M;
    vector<pair<int, int>> ants(N);
    int total_initial_coverage = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        cin >> ants[i].first >> ants[i].second;
        total_initial_coverage += 2 * ants[i].second;
        M = max(M, ants[i].first + ants[i].second);
    }

    check_broad_coverage_invariant(M, total_initial_coverage);
    check_sparse_antenna_invariant(N, M, ants);
    check_high_antenna_count_invariant(N, M, ants);
    check_frequent_updates_invariant(N, M);

    sort(ants.begin(), ants.end());
    vector<vector<int>> dp(N + 1, vector<int>(M + 1, 3 * M));
    vector<vector<int>> suffix_min(N + 1, vector<int>(M + 1, 3 * M));

    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        int l = ants[i].first - ants[i].second;
        int r = ants[i].first + ants[i].second;

        for (int j = 1; j <= M; ++j) {
            dp[i][j] = 3 * M;
            if (i > 0) dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j];
            if (j < r) continue;
            int ldelta = max(0, l - 1);
            int rdelta = max(0, j - r);
            dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], max(ldelta, rdelta));
            int delta = j - r;
            int new_l = max(1, l - delta);
            if (i != 0 || new_l == 1) {
                dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], delta + (new_l == 1 || i == 0 ? 0 : suffix_min[i - 1][new_l - 1]));
            }
        }

        for (int j = M; j >= 1; --j) {
            suffix_min[i][j] = dp[i][j];
            if (j < M) {
                suffix_min[i][j] = min(suffix_min[i][j], suffix_min[i][j + 1]);
            }
        }
    }
    int answer = 3 * M;
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        answer = min(answer, dp[i][M]);
    }
    cout << answer << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Broad Coverage Requirement Check**: After reading inputs, check if the total initial coverage is significantly less than `M`.
- **Sparse Initial Antenna Placement Check**: Check if the number of antennas is too low relative to `M`.
- **High Antenna Count with Minimal Initial Coverage Check**: Count antennas with minimal initial coverage and warn if more than half meet this condition.
- **Frequent Updates Check**: Estimate the number of operations based on `N` and `M` and check if it exceeds a threshold.

These checks are placed strategically before the main computations to ensure they do not add overhead in tight loops. They serve as preventive measures to detect performance bottlenecks associated with particular input patterns.
