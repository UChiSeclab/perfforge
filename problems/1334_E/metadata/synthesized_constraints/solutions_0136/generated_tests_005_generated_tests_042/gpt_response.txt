### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Line 46 (`for (long long x = 2; x * x <= dd; x++)`)**: The loop iterating over potential divisors of `d` is hit significantly more times during the slow input. This loop is associated with determining the prime factorization of `d`, and it indicates that when `d` has a large number of potential divisors, performance is negatively impacted.

2. **Lines 48-50 (`while (d % x == 0)`)**: This nested loop within the divisor-finding loop is also hit frequently, especially when `d` is divisible many times by a small factor `x`. This suggests that when numbers have high powers of small primes, the algorithm spends considerable time in this loop.

3. **Lines 16-19 in `calc_factorials` Function**: These lines execute a loop to calculate factorial values, which are critical for combinatorial calculations later. This loop is called with a large `n`, derived from the accumulation of positive differences (`sum = accumulate(pos.begin(), pos.end(), 0)`), suggesting factorial calculation for large numbers is costly.

4. **Generally High Hits for Lines Handling Factorials and Combinations**: The lines dealing with factorials, particularly resizing vectors for factorial calculations, are hit frequently, indicating a costly reallocation or recalculation when many divisor combinations are possible.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **Prime Factorization Complexity**: 
   - **Invariant**: "When `D` has a large number of distinct prime factors or high powers of small primes, the computation of its divisors becomes expensive."
   - **Explanation**: Since the loop computing divisors iterates over potential divisors up to the square root of `D`, having many small prime factors can significantly increase the time spent in divisor calculation. When `D` is a product of high powers of primes, especially small ones, the repeated division in the while loop adds up.

2. **Factorial Calculations**:
   - **Invariant**: "If the difference in exponents between divisors `u` and `v` leads to large values when summed up, performance can degrade due to expensive factorial calculations."
   - **Explanation**: The positive and negative deviations in prime factor exponents between two divisors are accumulated and factorialized. Large sums imply significant memory and computation time for factorial calculations.

3. **Query Complexity**:
   - **Invariant**: "When queries involve divisors that lead to complex prime factorizations or need extensive combinatorial calculations, performance may degrade."
   - **Explanation**: Complex pairings in queries that require deep exploration of divisors' prime factors lead to repeated and complex combinatorial computations, which are expensive.

4. **Memory Allocation for Factorials**:
   - **Invariant**: "If the problem requires frequent resizing of factorial-related vectors, the overhead of memory operations can slow down performance."
   - **Explanation**: Frequent resizing of vectors when computing factorials for large numbers can cause memory overhead, which impacts performance.

These invariants suggest that the program slows significantly when `D` has complex prime factor structures or when the sum of exponent differences from queries leads to large factorial calculations, both of which are exacerbated by memory operations and combinatorial logic.

### Phase 3: Implement Checker Code for Performance Invariants in C++

Based on the performance-characterizing invariants previously derived, we will now write C++ checker code for each invariant.

#### Invariant 1: Prime Factorization Complexity
**Checker Code:**
```cpp
void check_prime_factorization_complexity(long long d) {
    int prime_count = 0;
    for (long long x = 2; x * x <= d; x++) {
        if (d % x == 0) {
            prime_count++;
            while (d % x == 0) {
                d /= x;
            }
        }
    }
    if (d > 1) prime_count++;  // d is prime
    if (prime_count > 20) {
        cerr << "Warning: Prime factorization complexity triggered - too many distinct prime factors" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

#### Invariant 2: Factorial Calculation Complexity
**Checker Code:**
```cpp
void check_factorial_calculation_complexity(const vector<int>& diffs) {
    int sum = 0;
    for (int d : diffs) {
        sum += abs(d);
    }
    if (sum > 100) {  // Arbitrary threshold for complexity
        cerr << "Warning: Factorial calculation complexity triggered - high sum of exponent differences" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrate Checker Code into the Original C++ Program

Here, we modify the existing C++ program to integrate the above checker code at appropriate points.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

namespace combo {
const long long MOD = 998244353;
vector<long long> inv = {-1, 1};
vector<long long> fact = {1, 1};
vector<long long> ifact = {1, 1};
int precalculated = 1;
void calc_factorials(int n) {
  if (n <= precalculated) {
    return;
  }
  fact.resize(n + 1);
  inv.resize(n + 1);
  ifact.resize(n + 1);
  for (int i = precalculated + 1; i <= n; i++) {
    fact[i] = fact[i - 1] * i % MOD;
    inv[i] = -MOD / i * inv[MOD % i] % MOD;
    ifact[i] = ifact[i - 1] * inv[i] % MOD;
  }
  precalculated = n;
}
long long choose(int n, int k) {
  if (n < k) {
    return 0;
  }
  calc_factorials(n);
  return fact[n] * ifact[k] % MOD * ifact[n - k] % MOD;
}
long long permute(int n, int k) {
  if (n < k) {
    return 0;
  }
  calc_factorials(n);
  return fact[n] * ifact[n - k] % MOD;
}
}  // namespace combo
using namespace combo;

// Checker function for prime factorization complexity
void check_prime_factorization_complexity(long long d) {
    int prime_count = 0;
    for (long long x = 2; x * x <= d; x++) {
        if (d % x == 0) {
            prime_count++;
            while (d % x == 0) {
                d /= x;
            }
        }
    }
    if (d > 1) prime_count++;  // d is prime
    if (prime_count > 20) {
        cerr << "Warning: Prime factorization complexity triggered - too many distinct prime factors" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Checker function for factorial calculation complexity
void check_factorial_calculation_complexity(const vector<int>& diffs) {
    int sum = 0;
    for (int d : diffs) {
        sum += abs(d);
    }
    if (sum > 100) {  // Arbitrary threshold for complexity
        cerr << "Warning: Factorial calculation complexity triggered - high sum of exponent differences" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(0);

  long long d;
  cin >> d;
  
  // Check prime factorization complexity at the start
  check_prime_factorization_complexity(d);

  vector<pair<long long, int>> f;
  long long dd = d;
  for (long long x = 2; x * x <= dd; x++) {
    int e = 0;
    while (d % x == 0) {
      d /= x;
      e++;
    }
    if (e > 0) {
      f.emplace_back(x, e);
    }
  }
  if (d > 1) {
    f.emplace_back(d, 1);
  }

  int q;
  cin >> q;
  while (q--) {
    long long u, v;
    cin >> u >> v;
    vector<pair<int, int>> exps;
    vector<int> diffs;
    for (const auto &p : f) {
      int a = 0;
      while (u % p.first == 0) {
        u /= p.first;
        a++;
      }
      int b = 0;
      while (v % p.first == 0) {
        v /= p.first;
        b++;
      }
      exps.emplace_back(a, b);
      diffs.emplace_back(a - b);
    }

    // Check factorial calculation complexity based on diffs
    check_factorial_calculation_complexity(diffs);

    vector<int> pos, neg;
    for (int d : diffs) {
      if (d > 0) {
        pos.push_back(d);
      }
      if (d < 0) {
        neg.push_back(-d);
      }
    }
    long long ans = 1;
    for (int _ = 0; _ < 2; _++) {
      int sum = accumulate(pos.begin(), pos.end(), 0);
      calc_factorials(sum);
      ans *= fact[sum];
      ans %= MOD;
      for (int d : pos) {
        ans *= ifact[d];
        ans %= MOD;
      }
      swap(pos, neg);
    }
    if (ans < 0) {
      ans += MOD;
    }
    cout << ans << '\n';
  }
  return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Prime Factorization Complexity Check**: Placed right after reading `d`, this check ensures that if the prime factorization of `d` is too complex, it triggers a warning and aborts execution.
  
- **Factorial Calculation Complexity Check**: Placed after computing `diffs` and before any heavy combinatorial calculations, this check ensures that if the sum of exponent differences is too high, a warning is triggered, and execution is aborted.
