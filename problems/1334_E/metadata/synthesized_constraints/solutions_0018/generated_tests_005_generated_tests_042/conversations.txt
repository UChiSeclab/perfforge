system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

You are given a positive integer D. Let's build the following graph from it: 

  * each vertex is a divisor of D (not necessarily prime, 1 and D itself are also included); 
  * two vertices x and y (x > y) have an undirected edge between them if x is divisible by y and \frac x y is a prime; 
  * the weight of an edge is the number of divisors of x that are not divisors of y. 



For example, here is the graph for D=12: 

<image>

Edge (4,12) has weight 3 because 12 has divisors [1,2,3,4,6,12] and 4 has divisors [1,2,4]. Thus, there are 3 divisors of 12 that are not divisors of 4 — [3,6,12].

There is no edge between 3 and 2 because 3 is not divisible by 2. There is no edge between 12 and 3 because 12/3=4 is not a prime.

Let the length of the path between some vertices v and u in the graph be the total weight of edges on it. For example, path [(1, 2), (2, 6), (6, 12), (12, 4), (4, 2), (2, 6)] has length 1+2+2+3+1+2=11. The empty path has length 0.

So the shortest path between two vertices v and u is the path that has the minimal possible length.

Two paths a and b are different if there is either a different number of edges in them or there is a position i such that a_i and b_i are different edges.

You are given q queries of the following form: 

  * v u — calculate the number of the shortest paths between vertices v and u. 



The answer for each query might be large so print it modulo 998244353.

Input

The first line contains a single integer D (1 ≤ D ≤ 10^{15}) — the number the graph is built from.

The second line contains a single integer q (1 ≤ q ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5) — the number of queries.

Each of the next q lines contains two integers v and u (1 ≤ v, u ≤ D). It is guaranteed that D is divisible by both v and u (both v and u are divisors of D).

Output

Print q integers — for each query output the number of the shortest paths between the two given vertices modulo 998244353.

Note

In the first example: 

  * The first query is only the empty path — length 0; 
  * The second query are paths [(12, 4), (4, 2), (2, 1)] (length 3+1+1=5), [(12, 6), (6, 2), (2, 1)] (length 2+2+1=5) and [(12, 6), (6, 3), (3, 1)] (length 2+2+1=5). 
  * The third query is only the path [(3, 1), (1, 2), (2, 4)] (length 1+1+1=3).

assistant: To analyze the performance of the given C program, we need to identify why it runs significantly slower on the slow input compared to the fast input. Based on the provided hit count information and the code structure, let's go through the analysis:

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Line 12 (Recursive GCD):** The `gcd` function is recursively called multiple times, especially for the slow input. The `gcd` function's recursion hits 26 times on the slow input compared to only 6 times on the fast input.

2. **Line 24-26 (`while (a % d == 0)` Loop):** The loop inside the `calc` function that divides `a` by `d` runs 47 times on the slow input but not at all on the fast input. This suggests a heavy division operation for the slow input.

3. **Line 40 (`for (long long i = 1; i <= sum; ++i)` Loop):** The loop runs 45 times for the slow input compared to only 2 times for the fast input. This indicates that `sum` is significantly larger for the slow input, contributing to the delay.

4. **Line 63 (`for (long long i = 2; i <= sqrt(n); ++i)` Loop):** This loop, for finding divisors, executes over 4 million times on the slow input but only once on the fast input, indicating a significant computation load when finding divisors for large `n`.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on this analysis, we can derive some natural language invariants that describe conditions under which the program is likely to slow down:

1. **Recursion Depth Invariant:**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "If the recursive depth in calculating the GCD is too high, particularly for large values, it can slow down the computation significantly."
   - **Generic Condition:** This occurs when the number of recursive calls to `gcd` exceeds a typical depth for inputs close to the maximum constraints.

2. **Loop Over Divisors Invariant:**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "If the number of iterations for finding divisors becomes too large, particularly when `n` has a high number of divisors, the program can experience slow performance."
   - **Generic Condition:** This is likely when the divisor count approaches the square root of `n`, leading to excessive iterations.

3. **Repeated Division Invariant:**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "If a number has high divisibility by certain factors, leading to repeated divisions in a loop, it may cause prolonged execution."
   - **Generic Condition:** This scenario arises when repeated division on a number persists over many iterations, particularly when a factor is common in both `a` and `b`.

4. **Factorial Computation Invariant:**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "If the factorial calculation inside a loop spans a large range, due to large intermediate values, it causes significant delays."
   - **Generic Condition:** This occurs when the sum of exponents in the factorization difference is large, leading to high iteration counts in the factorial loop.

These invariants capture the primary reasons for slowdowns in the program when given specific types of inputs, without relying on specific numeric values. They focus on patterns and computational complexity that can trigger performance issues.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
You are given a positive integer D. Let's build the following graph from it: 

  * each vertex is a divisor of D (not necessarily prime, 1 and D itself are also included); 
  * two vertices x and y (x > y) have an undirected edge between them if x is divisible by y and \frac x y is a prime; 
  * the weight of an edge is the number of divisors of x that are not divisors of y. 



For example, here is the graph for D=12: 

<image>

Edge (4,12) has weight 3 because 12 has divisors [1,2,3,4,6,12] and 4 has divisors [1,2,4]. Thus, there are 3 divisors of 12 that are not divisors of 4 — [3,6,12].

There is no edge between 3 and 2 because 3 is not divisible by 2. There is no edge between 12 and 3 because 12/3=4 is not a prime.

Let the length of the path between some vertices v and u in the graph be the total weight of edges on it. For example, path [(1, 2), (2, 6), (6, 12), (12, 4), (4, 2), (2, 6)] has length 1+2+2+3+1+2=11. The empty path has length 0.

So the shortest path between two vertices v and u is the path that has the minimal possible length.

Two paths a and b are different if there is either a different number of edges in them or there is a position i such that a_i and b_i are different edges.

You are given q queries of the following form: 

  * v u — calculate the number of the shortest paths between vertices v and u. 



The answer for each query might be large so print it modulo 998244353.

Input

The first line contains a single integer D (1 ≤ D ≤ 10^{15}) — the number the graph is built from.

The second line contains a single integer q (1 ≤ q ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5) — the number of queries.

Each of the next q lines contains two integers v and u (1 ≤ v, u ≤ D). It is guaranteed that D is divisible by both v and u (both v and u are divisors of D).

Output

Print q integers — for each query output the number of the shortest paths between the two given vertices modulo 998244353.

Note

In the first example: 

  * The first query is only the empty path — length 0; 
  * The second query are paths [(12, 4), (4, 2), (2, 1)] (length 3+1+1=5), [(12, 6), (6, 2), (2, 1)] (length 2+2+1=5) and [(12, 6), (6, 3), (3, 1)] (length 2+2+1=5). 
  * The third query is only the path [(3, 1), (1, 2), (2, 4)] (length 1+1+1=3).

assistant: ### Phase 3: Implement Invariants as Checker Code

Here are the implementations of the performance-characterizing invariants as checker code in C++:

1. **Recursion Depth Invariant:**

```cpp
void check_gcd_recursion_depth(int depth) {
    if (depth > 50) { // Assuming 50 as a broad threshold for recursion depth
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - High recursion depth in `gcd` function!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

2. **Loop Over Divisors Invariant:**

```cpp
void check_divisor_loop(long long iterations, long long n) {
    if (iterations > sqrt(n) * 10) { // Broad threshold based on divisor count
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - High number of iterations in divisor loop!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

3. **Repeated Division Invariant:**

```cpp
void check_repeated_division(int division_count) {
    if (division_count > 100) { // Assuming 100 as a broad threshold for repeated divisions
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - Excessive repeated division!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

4. **Factorial Computation Invariant:**

```cpp
void check_factorial_computation(long long sum) {
    if (sum > 100) { // Assuming 100 as a broad threshold for factorial computation loop
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - Large factorial computation range!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrate Checkers into the Program

The following is the instrumented C++ code with integrated checks:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
const long long MAX_N = 2e5 + 7;
long long mod = 998244353;

void check_gcd_recursion_depth(int depth) {
    if (depth > 50) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - High recursion depth in `gcd` function!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_divisor_loop(long long iterations, long long n) {
    if (iterations > sqrt(n) * 10) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - High number of iterations in divisor loop!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_repeated_division(int division_count) {
    if (division_count > 100) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - Excessive repeated division!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_factorial_computation(long long sum) {
    if (sum > 100) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - Large factorial computation range!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

long long gcd(long long a, long long b, long long &x, long long &y, int depth = 0) {
    check_gcd_recursion_depth(depth);
    if (a == 0) {
        x = 0;
        y = 1;
        return b;
    }
    long long x1, y1;
    long long d = gcd(b % a, a, x1, y1, depth + 1);
    x = y1 - (b / a) * x1;
    y = x1;
    return d;
}

long long calc(long long a, long long b, vector<long long> &div) {
    vector<pair<long long, long long> > d_a, d_b;
    long long sum = 0;
    vector<long long> x;
    int division_count_a = 0, division_count_b = 0;
    
    for (long long d : div) {
        d_a.push_back({d, 0});
        d_b.push_back({d, 0});
        
        while (a % d == 0) {
            d_a[d_a.size() - 1].second++;
            a /= d;
            division_count_a++;
        }
        
        while (b % d == 0) {
            d_b[d_b.size() - 1].second++;
            b /= d;
            division_count_b++;
        }
        
        long long c = d_a[d_a.size() - 1].second - d_b[d_b.size() - 1].second;
        sum += d_a[d_a.size() - 1].second - d_b[d_b.size() - 1].second;
        if (c != 0) x.push_back(c);
    }

    sort(x.begin(), x.end());
    long long zn = 1;
    long long fact = 1;
    long long pos = 0;
    
    check_factorial_computation(sum);
    
    for (long long i = 1; i <= sum; ++i) {
        fact *= i;
        fact %= mod;
        while (pos < x.size() && x[pos] == i) {
            zn *= fact;
            zn %= mod;
            pos++;
        }
    }
    long long x1, y1;
    gcd(zn, mod, x1, y1);
    x1 %= mod;
    x1 += mod;
    x1 %= mod;
    return (x1 * fact) % mod;
}

signed main() {
    ios::sync_with_stdio(0);
    cin.tie(0);
    long long n, q;
    cin >> n >> q;
    vector<long long> div;
    long long r = n;
    long long divisor_iterations = 0;

        divisor_iterations++;
        if (r % i == 0) {
            div.push_back(i);
            while (r % i == 0) r /= i;
        }
    }
    
    check_divisor_loop(divisor_iterations, n);

        long long x1, y1;
        long long d = gcd(a, b, x1, y1);
        cout << (calc(a, d, div) * calc(b, d, div)) % mod << endl;
    }
}
```

### Explanation

- **Recursion Depth Check:** Added a depth parameter to the `gcd` function to track recursion depth and inserted a check at the start of the function.
  
- **Divisor Loop Check:** Added a counter for iterations in the loop where divisors are found and inserted the check after the loop.

- **Repeated Division Check:** Counted the number of divisions in the `calc` function and inserted checks after processing `a` and `b`.

- **Factorial Computation Check:** Checked the value of `sum` before the factorial loop in `calc` to ensure it's within a reasonable range.
