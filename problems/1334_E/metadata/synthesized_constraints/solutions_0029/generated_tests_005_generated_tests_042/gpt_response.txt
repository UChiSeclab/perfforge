=== Invariants Response ===
Let's analyze the hit count information and the code provided to identify potential performance bottlenecks:

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Hit Count Analysis**:
   - The line `for (int i = 1; 1LL * i * i <= d; ++i)` at line 28 is executed 4,194,305 times in the slow input, compared to only 2 times in the fast input.
   - The lines within this loop, especially the divisor checks and additions to the vector `div`, are also hit significantly more times.
   - Another loop `for (auto it1 : pr)` at line 50 is executed 90 times in the slow input and only 1 time in the fast input.
   - The loop `while (aux % it1 == 0)` at line 52 is executed 1,035 times in the slow input, highlighting a potentially expensive operation related to factorization.

2. **Potential Bottleneck**:
   - The main bottleneck seems to be the divisor enumeration and factorization process when `d` is large or has many divisors.
   - Prime factorization and handling of divisors are computationally intensive steps, especially with large numbers like 17592186044416.

3. **Data Structures and Loops**:
   - The `div` vector grows significantly when `d` is large, causing repeated operations.
   - The nested loops iterating over `div` and `pr` (prime factors) contribute to the slowdown.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **Invariants Based on Observations**:

   **Invariant #1**: 
   - **Natural Language**: "If the number `D` has a large number of divisors, the process of finding all divisors and subsequently prime factorizing them may result in significant slowdowns."
   - This is because the divisors contribute to the size of the loops iterating over them, leading to considerable computational cost when `D` is large.

   **Invariant #2**:
   - **Natural Language**: "When `D` is a large number or has a large prime factor, the iteration over potential divisors becomes expensive, particularly when checking divisibility and computing factorization."
   - This relates to the nested loop structure, where a large number of iterations are performed due to numerous divisor checks and factorization operations.

2. **Threshold Considerations**:
   - While the exact values of `D` are not specified in the problem constraints, any scenario where the divisor count or prime factorization depth increases significantly can trigger these invariants.
   - Particularly, when `D` has many small divisors or includes a large prime factor, the performance deteriorates.

3. **Utility for Fuzzing**:
   - These checks can help in fuzz-testing scenarios to identify slow-performing cases when `D` leads to extensive divisor and prime calculations.

By understanding how these invariants are triggered, we can better predict and manage the performance of the program under different input conditions, especially those involving large numbers or complex factorization landscapes.

Phase 3: Implementing Natural Language Invariants in C++

Based on the performance-characterizing invariants derived earlier, we need to implement the following C++ checkers:

### Checker #1: Divisor Count Check
This checker will identify if `D` has a large number of divisors, which may result in a slowdown due to the overhead of processing these divisors.

```cpp
void check_divisor_count_invariant(size_t divisorCount) {
    if (divisorCount > 100000) { // Threshold can be adjusted based on empirical analysis
        cerr << "Warning: High divisor count invariant triggered - potential performance bottleneck." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Checker #2: Prime Factorization Depth Check
This checker will identify if `D` has a high depth of factorization, which may lead to slow performance.

```cpp
void check_prime_factorization_depth_invariant(size_t factorizationDepth) {
    if (factorizationDepth > 100) { // Arbitrary threshold for demonstration
        cerr << "Warning: High factorization depth invariant triggered - potential performance bottleneck." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

Phase 4: Integrating Checkers into the Original Program

Now, let's integrate these checkers into the provided C++ program at appropriate locations.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
const int MAXN = 100;
const int MOD = 998244353;
int fact[105];
int inv[105];

void check_divisor_count_invariant(size_t divisorCount) {
    if (divisorCount > 100000) {
        cerr << "Warning: High divisor count invariant triggered - potential performance bottleneck." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_prime_factorization_depth_invariant(size_t factorizationDepth) {
    if (factorizationDepth > 100) {
        cerr << "Warning: High factorization depth invariant triggered - potential performance bottleneck." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int lgput(int a, int b) {
    int ans = 1;
    for (; b; b >>= 1) {
        if (b & 1) ans = 1LL * ans * a % MOD;
        a = 1LL * a * a % MOD;
    }
    return ans;
}
map<long long, int> ways;
long long gcd(long long a, long long b) {
    while (b) {
        long long r = a % b;
        a = b;
        b = r;
    }
    return a;
}

int main() {
    long long d;
    scanf("%lld", &d);
    vector<long long> div;
    for (int i = 1; 1LL * i * i <= d; ++i) {
        if (d % i == 0) {
            div.push_back(i);
            if (d / i != i) div.push_back(d / i);
        }
    }

    // Check for high divisor count
    check_divisor_count_invariant(div.size());

    vector<long long> pr;
    for (int i = 2; 1LL * i * i <= d; ++i) {
        if (d % i == 0) {
            pr.push_back(i);
            while (d % i == 0) d /= i;
        }
    }
    if (d > 1) pr.push_back(d);

    // Check for high prime factorization depth
    check_prime_factorization_depth_invariant(pr.size());

    fact[0] = 1;
    for (int i = 1; i <= MAXN; ++i) fact[i] = 1LL * fact[i - 1] * i % MOD;
    inv[MAXN] = lgput(fact[MAXN], MOD - 2);
    for (int i = MAXN - 1; i >= 0; --i) inv[i] = 1LL * inv[i + 1] * (i + 1) % MOD;
    for (auto it : div) {
        int nr = 1;
        long long aux = it;
        int dd = 0;
        for (auto it1 : pr) {
            int d1 = 0;
            while (aux % it1 == 0) {
                d1++;
                aux /= it1;
            }
            dd += d1;
            nr = 1LL * nr * inv[d1] % MOD;
        }
        nr = 1LL * nr * fact[dd] % MOD;
        ways[it] = nr;
    }
    int q;
    scanf("%d", &q);
    for (int i = 1; i <= q; ++i) {
        long long u, v;
        scanf("%lld%lld", &u, &v);
        long long g = gcd(u, v);
        int ans1 = ways[u / g];
        int ans2 = ways[v / g];
        printf("%d\n", 1LL * ans1 * ans2 % MOD);
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of Integration

- **Divisor Count Check**: The check is placed immediately after the divisor list is populated to prevent excess computation if the count is already too high.
- **Prime Factorization Depth Check**: The check is added right after all prime factors of `D` have been determined. This allows early detection of potential bottlenecks from excessive factorization depth.

These checks help ensure that the program avoids scenarios where it might perform poorly due to excessive overhead from processing divisors or factorizing large numbers.
