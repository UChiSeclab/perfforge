system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

You are given a positive integer D. Let's build the following graph from it: 

  * each vertex is a divisor of D (not necessarily prime, 1 and D itself are also included); 
  * two vertices x and y (x > y) have an undirected edge between them if x is divisible by y and \frac x y is a prime; 
  * the weight of an edge is the number of divisors of x that are not divisors of y. 



For example, here is the graph for D=12: 

<image>

Edge (4,12) has weight 3 because 12 has divisors [1,2,3,4,6,12] and 4 has divisors [1,2,4]. Thus, there are 3 divisors of 12 that are not divisors of 4 — [3,6,12].

There is no edge between 3 and 2 because 3 is not divisible by 2. There is no edge between 12 and 3 because 12/3=4 is not a prime.

Let the length of the path between some vertices v and u in the graph be the total weight of edges on it. For example, path [(1, 2), (2, 6), (6, 12), (12, 4), (4, 2), (2, 6)] has length 1+2+2+3+1+2=11. The empty path has length 0.

So the shortest path between two vertices v and u is the path that has the minimal possible length.

Two paths a and b are different if there is either a different number of edges in them or there is a position i such that a_i and b_i are different edges.

You are given q queries of the following form: 

  * v u — calculate the number of the shortest paths between vertices v and u. 



The answer for each query might be large so print it modulo 998244353.

Input

The first line contains a single integer D (1 ≤ D ≤ 10^{15}) — the number the graph is built from.

The second line contains a single integer q (1 ≤ q ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5) — the number of queries.

Each of the next q lines contains two integers v and u (1 ≤ v, u ≤ D). It is guaranteed that D is divisible by both v and u (both v and u are divisors of D).

Output

Print q integers — for each query output the number of the shortest paths between the two given vertices modulo 998244353.

Note

In the first example: 

  * The first query is only the empty path — length 0; 
  * The second query are paths [(12, 4), (4, 2), (2, 1)] (length 3+1+1=5), [(12, 6), (6, 2), (2, 1)] (length 2+2+1=5) and [(12, 6), (6, 3), (3, 1)] (length 2+2+1=5). 
  * The third query is only the path [(3, 1), (1, 2), (2, 4)] (length 1+1+1=3).

assistant: ### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

**Analysis of Hit Counts:**
1. **Loop at Line 41** (`for (long long i = 2; i * i <= D; i++)`): 
   - **Slow Input Hit Count**: 4,194,304
   - **Fast Input Hit Count**: 1
   - This loop is executed a significantly larger number of times for the slow input. It iterates through potential divisors of `D` to find all prime factors.

2. **Line 42** (`if (d % i) continue;`):
   - **Slow Input Hit Count**: 4,194,303
   - Skips many iterations, indicating many non-divisors have been checked due to the large value of `D`.

3. **Prime Factorization (Lines 43-44)**:
   - **Slow Input Hit Count**: Line 43 executed once, Line 44 executed 45 times.
   - A large number of divisions occur here, suggesting `d` has many factors.

4. **Prime-based Calculations (Lines 52-66)**:
   - The loop over primes (Line 52) for the slow input executes twice, suggesting there are at least two significant primes affecting performance.

**Inference:**
- The bottleneck primarily arises from the prime factorization loop (`for (long long i = 2; i * i <= D; i++)`) due to the large size of `D`. This loop is responsible for the significant difference in execution due to its dependence on the size and factorization complexity of `D`.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **Invariant 1: Large Number of Divisors**
   - **Natural Language**: "When `D` has a high number of divisors, the time spent in divisor computation, particularly in determining prime factors, increases significantly, leading to a slowdown."
   - **Reasoning**: As seen from the loop executing a large number of times, `D` with many divisors will cause the loop to iterate excessively.

2. **Invariant 2: Large Value of `D`**
   - **Natural Language**: "If `D` is large, the algorithm spends a significant amount of time factoring `D`, especially when the number is close to the upper constraint. This results in many operations to identify its divisors and prime factors, potentially slowing down the execution."
   - **Reasoning**: The loop to find prime factors executes a large number of iterations when `D` is large, indicating that near the constraint limit, the performance degrades due to extensive calculations.

3. **Invariant 3: High Prime Density**
   - **Natural Language**: "When `D` is composed of numbers with high prime density (i.e., a large number of small prime factors), the number of operations to re-factor and analyze each prime factor in the queries increases, leading to slower performance."
   - **Reasoning**: For each query, the algorithm re-evaluates prime factors. Having many small primes increases the computational load per query.

### Conclusion

The key performance bottleneck relates to the size of `D` and its divisor structure. Specifically, larger values of `D` with many divisors or dense prime factors lead to increased computation time. The presence of high prime density in `D` also compounds the problem during query handling, as each query necessitates prime-based recalculations.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
You are given a positive integer D. Let's build the following graph from it: 

  * each vertex is a divisor of D (not necessarily prime, 1 and D itself are also included); 
  * two vertices x and y (x > y) have an undirected edge between them if x is divisible by y and \frac x y is a prime; 
  * the weight of an edge is the number of divisors of x that are not divisors of y. 



For example, here is the graph for D=12: 

<image>

Edge (4,12) has weight 3 because 12 has divisors [1,2,3,4,6,12] and 4 has divisors [1,2,4]. Thus, there are 3 divisors of 12 that are not divisors of 4 — [3,6,12].

There is no edge between 3 and 2 because 3 is not divisible by 2. There is no edge between 12 and 3 because 12/3=4 is not a prime.

Let the length of the path between some vertices v and u in the graph be the total weight of edges on it. For example, path [(1, 2), (2, 6), (6, 12), (12, 4), (4, 2), (2, 6)] has length 1+2+2+3+1+2=11. The empty path has length 0.

So the shortest path between two vertices v and u is the path that has the minimal possible length.

Two paths a and b are different if there is either a different number of edges in them or there is a position i such that a_i and b_i are different edges.

You are given q queries of the following form: 

  * v u — calculate the number of the shortest paths between vertices v and u. 



The answer for each query might be large so print it modulo 998244353.

Input

The first line contains a single integer D (1 ≤ D ≤ 10^{15}) — the number the graph is built from.

The second line contains a single integer q (1 ≤ q ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5) — the number of queries.

Each of the next q lines contains two integers v and u (1 ≤ v, u ≤ D). It is guaranteed that D is divisible by both v and u (both v and u are divisors of D).

Output

Print q integers — for each query output the number of the shortest paths between the two given vertices modulo 998244353.

Note

In the first example: 

  * The first query is only the empty path — length 0; 
  * The second query are paths [(12, 4), (4, 2), (2, 1)] (length 3+1+1=5), [(12, 6), (6, 2), (2, 1)] (length 2+2+1=5) and [(12, 6), (6, 3), (3, 1)] (length 2+2+1=5). 
  * The third query is only the path [(3, 1), (1, 2), (2, 4)] (length 1+1+1=3).

assistant: ### Phase 3: Implementing the Natural Language Invariants in C++

Below are the C++ code snippets for the runtime checks based on the performance-characterizing invariants derived earlier.

```cpp
void check_large_divisor_count(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to high number of divisors!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_large_value_of_D(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to large value of D!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_high_prime_density(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to high prime density!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

These checks are designed to be called at strategic points in the program to detect potential performance bottlenecks.

### Phase 4: Integrating the Checks into the C++ Program

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Function to check large number of divisors
void check_large_divisor_count(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to high number of divisors!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Function to check large value of D
void check_large_value_of_D(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to large value of D!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Function to check high prime density
void check_high_prime_density(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to high prime density!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

template <class T, class U>
void ckmin(T &a, U b) {
  if (a > b) a = b;
}
template <class T, class U>
void ckmax(T &a, U b) {
  if (a < b) a = b;
}
const int INF = 998244353;
long long D;
int Q;
vector<long long> primes;
int fact[70], ifact[70];
int mul(int a, int b) { return (long long)a * b % INF; }
int pwr(int a, int b) {
  int res = 1;
  while (b) {
    if (b & 1) res = mul(res, a);
    a = mul(a, a);
    b >>= 1;
  }
  return res;
}
int32_t main() {
  cout << fixed << setprecision(12);
  cerr << fixed << setprecision(4);
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(0);
  fact[0] = 1;
  for (auto i = (1); i < (69); i++) {
    fact[i] = mul(fact[i - 1], i);
  }
  ifact[68] = pwr(fact[68], INF - 2);
  for (auto i = (68) - 1; i >= (0); i--) {
    ifact[i] = mul(ifact[i + 1], i + 1);
  }
  cin >> D >> Q;
  
  // Check for large value of D
  check_large_value_of_D(D > 1e14); // Example threshold for large D

  long long d = D;
  int divisor_count = 0;
  
  for (long long i = 2; i * i <= D; i++) {
    if (d % i) continue;
    primes.push_back(i);
    while (d % i == 0) d /= i;
    divisor_count++;
  }
  if (d > 1) primes.push_back(d);
  divisor_count++;
  
  // Check for high number of divisors
  check_large_divisor_count(divisor_count > 100); // Example threshold for divisors

  // Check for high prime density
  check_high_prime_density(primes.size() > 5); // Example threshold for prime density

  while (Q--) {
    int incr = 0, decr = 0;
    long long u, v;
    cin >> u >> v;
    long long ans = 1;
    for (long long p : primes) {
      int net = 0;
      while (u % p == 0) {
        net++;
        u /= p;
      }
      while (v % p == 0) {
        net--;
        v /= p;
      }
      ans = mul(ans, ifact[abs(net)]);
      if (net < 0)
        incr -= net;
      else
        decr += net;
    }
    ans = mul(ans, fact[incr]);
    ans = mul(ans, fact[decr]);
    cout << ans << '\n';
  }
  return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**
- **Check for Large Divisor Count**: This check occurs after calculating the divisors to ensure the count does not exceed a reasonable threshold, indicating potential performance issues.
- **Check for Large Value of `D`**: This check is added right after reading `D`, setting a threshold to flag large values.
- **Check for High Prime Density**: This check is placed after the prime factorization process to verify that the number of distinct prime factors does not exceed a threshold.

These checks are strategically placed to ensure they detect performance bottlenecks without introducing significant overhead in critical parts of the code.
