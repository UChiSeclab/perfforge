system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

It is well known that the planet suffers from the energy crisis. Little Petya doesn't like that and wants to save the world. For this purpose he needs every accumulator to contain the same amount of energy. Initially every accumulator has some amount of energy: the i-th accumulator has ai units of energy. Energy can be transferred from one accumulator to the other. Every time x units of energy are transferred (x is not necessarily an integer) k percent of it is lost. That is, if x units were transferred from one accumulator to the other, amount of energy in the first one decreased by x units and in other increased by <image> units.

Your task is to help Petya find what maximum equal amount of energy can be stored in each accumulator after the transfers.

Input

First line of the input contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 10000, 0 ≤ k ≤ 99) — number of accumulators and the percent of energy that is lost during transfers.

Next line contains n integers a1, a2, ... , an — amounts of energy in the first, second, .., n-th accumulator respectively (0 ≤ ai ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ i ≤ n).

Output

Output maximum possible amount of energy that can remain in each of accumulators after the transfers of energy.

The absolute or relative error in the answer should not exceed 10 - 6.

assistant: To analyze the given C program and derive performance-characterizing invariants, we'll go through the provided hit count information and identify the potential performance bottlenecks.

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Line-level Hit Count Analysis:**
   - The `pos(double x)` function is called 5000 times in both the fast and slow runs. However, the loop inside the function (`for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)`) is executed significantly more times in the slow run (520,000 times) than in the fast run (30,000 times).
   - Lines inside this loop, specifically the conditional check (`if (a[i] > x)`) and the associated operations, are executed far more frequently for the slow input. In particular, line 10 (energy transfer with loss) and line 12 (energy addition) have a significant number of hits.

2. **Inference:**
   - The loop in the `pos` function scales with `n`, and the overall execution time is heavily influenced by the number of accumulators. The slow input has `n = 103`, which is significantly larger than the fast input's `n = 5`, causing a higher loop execution count.
   - The binary search loop (`while (cnt--)`) in `main` consistently executes 5000 iterations. The number of iterations required for convergence in the binary search is independent of `n` but affects overall performance in combination with how often `pos` is called.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the analysis above, we can derive the following performance-characterizing invariants:

1. **Invariant on Number of Accumulators:**
   - Natural Language Statement: "When the number of accumulators `n` is large, the program may slow down significantly due to the increased number of iterations in the inner loop of the `pos` function, which runs in conjunction with each binary search iteration."
   - This invariant highlights that as `n` approaches its upper limit (10000), the inner loop's execution time in `pos` increases, potentially causing a slowdown.

2. **Invariant on Energy Distribution:**
   - Natural Language Statement: "If the initial energy distribution among accumulators is highly unbalanced, the condition checks and arithmetic operations in the `pos` function become frequent, contributing to longer execution times."
   - This invariant suggests that a wide variance in initial energy levels across the accumulators could lead to more frequent execution of the conditional branches and arithmetic operations.

3. **Invariant on Precision and Iteration Count:**
   - Natural Language Statement: "The high precision requirement for finding the maximum possible equal energy in each accumulator results in a fixed number of binary search iterations, which, combined with a large `n`, results in longer overall execution time."
   - This invariant emphasizes that the program's need for a precise result necessitates a fixed number of iterations (5000), which can exacerbate the execution time with larger `n`.

These invariants provide a broad understanding of the conditions that lead to slow execution, helping identify areas for potential optimization or further investigation.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
It is well known that the planet suffers from the energy crisis. Little Petya doesn't like that and wants to save the world. For this purpose he needs every accumulator to contain the same amount of energy. Initially every accumulator has some amount of energy: the i-th accumulator has ai units of energy. Energy can be transferred from one accumulator to the other. Every time x units of energy are transferred (x is not necessarily an integer) k percent of it is lost. That is, if x units were transferred from one accumulator to the other, amount of energy in the first one decreased by x units and in other increased by <image> units.

Your task is to help Petya find what maximum equal amount of energy can be stored in each accumulator after the transfers.

Input

First line of the input contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 10000, 0 ≤ k ≤ 99) — number of accumulators and the percent of energy that is lost during transfers.

Next line contains n integers a1, a2, ... , an — amounts of energy in the first, second, .., n-th accumulator respectively (0 ≤ ai ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ i ≤ n).

Output

Output maximum possible amount of energy that can remain in each of accumulators after the transfers of energy.

The absolute or relative error in the answer should not exceed 10 - 6.

assistant: ### Phase 3: Implement Performance-Characterizing Invariants in C++

For each natural language invariant identified in Phase 2, we will create a corresponding C++ checker function to detect when the condition is met and potentially triggers a performance bottleneck.

1. **Invariant on Number of Accumulators:**
   - This invariant checks if `n` is large enough to cause performance issues due to the inner loop execution in the `pos` function.

```cpp
void check_accumulator_count_invariant(int n) {
    if (n > 1000) {  // Assuming a threshold for demonstration; adjust based on empirical testing
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck - large number of accumulators!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

2. **Invariant on Energy Distribution:**
   - This invariant checks if there is a large variance in initial energy levels, which might slow down the program due to frequent condition checks and arithmetic operations.

```cpp
void check_energy_distribution_invariant(const vector<double>& energies) {
    double max_energy = *max_element(energies.begin(), energies.end());
    double min_energy = *min_element(energies.begin(), energies.end());
    if (max_energy - min_energy > 500) {  // Threshold for unbalanced distribution
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck - highly unbalanced energy distribution!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

3. **Invariant on Precision and Iteration Count:**
   - This invariant ensures the iteration count in binary search remains consistent with performance expectations.

```cpp
void check_iteration_count_invariant(int iterationCount) {
    if (iterationCount > 5000) { // Fixed number used in the original code
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck - excessive iteration count!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Instrument the Original Program with Checker Code

We will integrate the above checker functions into the provided C++ solution to detect and address potential performance bottlenecks.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
const double eps = 1e-9;
double a[10111], k;
int n;

// Checker functions
void check_accumulator_count_invariant(int n) {
    if (n > 1000) {  // Assuming a threshold for demonstration
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck - large number of accumulators!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_energy_distribution_invariant() {
    double max_energy = *max_element(a, a + n);
    double min_energy = *min_element(a, a + n);
    if (max_energy - min_energy > 500) {  // Threshold for unbalanced distribution
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck - highly unbalanced energy distribution!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_iteration_count_invariant(int iterationCount) {
    if (iterationCount > 5000) {  // Fixed number used in the original code
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck - excessive iteration count!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Function to check if it's possible to achieve 'x' energy level
bool pos(double x) {
    double s = 0.0;

### Explanation

- **Accumulator Count Check:** Added right after reading the input to ensure the number of accumulators doesn't trigger a bottleneck.
- **Energy Distribution Check:** Added after initial energy values are read to check for distribution variance.
- **Iteration Count Check:** Placed before the binary search loop to ensure the expected fixed iteration count (5000) is not exceeded.

These checks help monitor potential performance bottlenecks and provide early warnings for scenarios that could degrade performance significantly.
