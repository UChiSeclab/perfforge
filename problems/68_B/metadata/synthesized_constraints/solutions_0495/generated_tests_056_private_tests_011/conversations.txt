system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

It is well known that the planet suffers from the energy crisis. Little Petya doesn't like that and wants to save the world. For this purpose he needs every accumulator to contain the same amount of energy. Initially every accumulator has some amount of energy: the i-th accumulator has ai units of energy. Energy can be transferred from one accumulator to the other. Every time x units of energy are transferred (x is not necessarily an integer) k percent of it is lost. That is, if x units were transferred from one accumulator to the other, amount of energy in the first one decreased by x units and in other increased by <image> units.

Your task is to help Petya find what maximum equal amount of energy can be stored in each accumulator after the transfers.

Input

First line of the input contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 10000, 0 ≤ k ≤ 99) — number of accumulators and the percent of energy that is lost during transfers.

Next line contains n integers a1, a2, ... , an — amounts of energy in the first, second, .., n-th accumulator respectively (0 ≤ ai ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ i ≤ n).

Output

Output maximum possible amount of energy that can remain in each of accumulators after the transfers of energy.

The absolute or relative error in the answer should not exceed 10 - 6.

assistant: Based on the provided C code and hit count information, let's analyze the performance bottleneck and derive performance-characterizing invariants.

### Phase 1: Identifying Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Line-Level Hit Count Comparison:**
   - The function `com(double a, double b)` is called significantly more often in the slow input (155,089 times) compared to the fast input (9,045 times).
   - The loop in the function `valid(vector<int>& v1, double num, int k)` is also executed many more times for the slow input (104,000 iterations) compared to the fast input (6,000 iterations).

2. **Pinpointing Expensive Operations:**
   - The function `valid` includes loops and conditional checks that execute numerous times due to the repeated calls within the binary search loop in `main`.

3. **Data Structure Interaction:**
   - The vector `v1` is iterated multiple times in `valid`, and the operations `pos += (v1[i] - num)` and `neg += (num - v1[i]) * 100 / (100 - k)` rely on the values of `v1`.

4. **Loop and Recursion Impact:**
   - The outer loop in `main` runs a fixed 1,000 iterations for binary search, but the critical slowdown arises from multiple invocations of `valid` and internal operations on the vector `v1`.

### Phase 2: Deriving Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Given the analysis above, here are some natural language invariants that describe conditions under which the program might enter a slow path:

1. **Invariant on Number of Accumulators (n):**
   - "When the number of accumulators (`n`) is large relative to the energy transfer percentage (`k`), the performance may degrade because the binary search and validity check process is applied across many elements, causing excessive iterations."

2. **Invariant on Energy Distribution:**
   - "If there is a high variance in the initial energy distribution among accumulators, the energy balancing operations become more complex and repeated, increasing execution time."

3. **Invariant on Loss Percentage (k):**
   - "A high energy loss percentage (`k`) combined with a large number of accumulators requires more precise energy balancing, invoking numerous checks and causing potential slowdowns."

4. **Invariant on Iteration Convergence:**
   - "As the algorithm relies on 1,000 iterations of binary search, scenarios where the energy differences among accumulators converge slowly can result in longer execution times, especially with larger accumulator counts."

These invariants aim to capture broad conditions that could lead to slower execution without relying on exact input values or scenarios, focusing instead on input patterns and algorithmic behavior.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
It is well known that the planet suffers from the energy crisis. Little Petya doesn't like that and wants to save the world. For this purpose he needs every accumulator to contain the same amount of energy. Initially every accumulator has some amount of energy: the i-th accumulator has ai units of energy. Energy can be transferred from one accumulator to the other. Every time x units of energy are transferred (x is not necessarily an integer) k percent of it is lost. That is, if x units were transferred from one accumulator to the other, amount of energy in the first one decreased by x units and in other increased by <image> units.

Your task is to help Petya find what maximum equal amount of energy can be stored in each accumulator after the transfers.

Input

First line of the input contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 10000, 0 ≤ k ≤ 99) — number of accumulators and the percent of energy that is lost during transfers.

Next line contains n integers a1, a2, ... , an — amounts of energy in the first, second, .., n-th accumulator respectively (0 ≤ ai ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ i ≤ n).

Output

Output maximum possible amount of energy that can remain in each of accumulators after the transfers of energy.

The absolute or relative error in the answer should not exceed 10 - 6.

assistant: ### Phase 3: Implementing the Invariants as C++ Checkers

Let's translate the natural language invariants into C++ code that checks these conditions at runtime.

1. **Invariant on Number of Accumulators (`n`):**
   - **Natural Language:** When the number of accumulators (`n`) is large relative to the energy transfer percentage (`k`), the performance may degrade.
   - **Checker Code:**

   ```cpp
   void check_accumulator_invariant(int n, int k) {
       if (n > 1000 && k < 30) { // Arbitrary thresholds for demonstration
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large number of accumulators with low energy transfer percentage!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Invariant on Energy Distribution:**
   - **Natural Language:** If there is a high variance in the initial energy distribution among accumulators, the operations may take longer.
   - **Checker Code:**

   ```cpp
   void check_energy_distribution_invariant(const vector<int>& v1) {
       int max_energy = *max_element(v1.begin(), v1.end());
       int min_energy = *min_element(v1.begin(), v1.end());
       if (max_energy - min_energy > 500) { // Arbitrary threshold
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high variance in energy distribution!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Invariant on Loss Percentage (`k`):**
   - **Natural Language:** A high energy loss percentage (`k`) combined with a large number of accumulators requires more precise balancing.
   - **Checker Code:**

   ```cpp
   void check_loss_percentage_invariant(int n, int k) {
       if (k > 70 && n > 500) { // Arbitrary thresholds for demonstration
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high energy loss percentage with many accumulators!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Integrating the Checkers into the Original Program

Now, let's integrate these checks into the original C++ program. We will place these checks in appropriate locations to avoid unnecessary overhead in tight loops.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

void file() {}
void fast() {
    std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
    cin.tie(NULL);
}

int com(double a, double b) {
    if (abs(a - b) <= 1e-6)
        return 0;
    else if (a > b)
        return 1;
    else
        return 2;
}

int valid(vector<int>& v1, double num, int k) {
    double pos = 0, neg = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < (int)(v1.size()); i++) {
        if (com(v1[i], num) == 1)
            pos += (v1[i] - num);
        else if (com(v1[i], num) == 2)
            neg += (num - v1[i]) * 100 / (100 - k);
    }
    return com(neg, pos);
}

// Checkers
void check_accumulator_invariant(int n, int k) {
    if (n > 1000 && k < 30) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large number of accumulators with low energy transfer percentage!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_energy_distribution_invariant(const vector<int>& v1) {
    int max_energy = *max_element(v1.begin(), v1.end());
    int min_energy = *min_element(v1.begin(), v1.end());
    if (max_energy - min_energy > 500) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high variance in energy distribution!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_loss_percentage_invariant(int n, int k) {
    if (k > 70 && n > 500) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high energy loss percentage with many accumulators!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    file();
    fast();

    double n, k;
    cin >> n >> k;
    
    vector<int> v1(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) cin >> v1[i];

    // Insert checks after reading input
    check_accumulator_invariant(n, k); // Check for accumulator count vs. loss percentage
    check_energy_distribution_invariant(v1); // Check for energy distribution variance
    check_loss_percentage_invariant(n, k); // Check for high loss percentage with many accumulators

    double start = 0, end = INT_MAX, mid, ans = -1;
    for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
        mid = (start + end) / 2.0;
        if (valid(v1, mid, k) == 2)
            start = mid;
        else {
            end = mid;
            ans = mid;
        }
    }

    cout << fixed << setprecision(9);
    cout << ans << "\n";
    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation of Integration:**
- The checkers are placed after reading inputs to ensure that they run once per execution, avoiding unnecessary overhead in loops.
- Each checker examines the conditions that could lead to performance bottlenecks as discussed in the natural language invariants.
