system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

It is well known that the planet suffers from the energy crisis. Little Petya doesn't like that and wants to save the world. For this purpose he needs every accumulator to contain the same amount of energy. Initially every accumulator has some amount of energy: the i-th accumulator has ai units of energy. Energy can be transferred from one accumulator to the other. Every time x units of energy are transferred (x is not necessarily an integer) k percent of it is lost. That is, if x units were transferred from one accumulator to the other, amount of energy in the first one decreased by x units and in other increased by <image> units.

Your task is to help Petya find what maximum equal amount of energy can be stored in each accumulator after the transfers.

Input

First line of the input contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 10000, 0 ≤ k ≤ 99) — number of accumulators and the percent of energy that is lost during transfers.

Next line contains n integers a1, a2, ... , an — amounts of energy in the first, second, .., n-th accumulator respectively (0 ≤ ai ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ i ≤ n).

Output

Output maximum possible amount of energy that can remain in each of accumulators after the transfers of energy.

The absolute or relative error in the answer should not exceed 10 - 6.

assistant: To diagnose the performance bottlenecks and derive performance-characterizing invariants for the provided C program, let's go through the analysis step-by-step:

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Line-Level Hit Count Comparison**:
   - The slow run hits line 6 (`for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)`) and consequently lines 7-12, significantly more often than the fast run. This indicates that the loop in the `ok()` function is contributing to the slowdown.
   - Specifically, the conditions inside the loop at lines 7 and 10 are executed numerous times (102,897 times) during the slow run.
   - The loop inside the `ok()` function is responsible for repeatedly calculating `z1` and `z2` based on the current guess `x` across all accumulators.

2. **Interaction with Data Structures**:
   - The program uses a binary search approach to find the maximum equal energy level. Each iteration involves recalculating potential energy distributions across accumulators, meaning the loop complexity and number of iterations impact performance heavily.

3. **Binary Search Iterations**:
   - The binary search loop in `main()` also gets executed 999 times in both runs, but the computational load for each iteration is determined by the inner loop in `ok()`. The binary search is expected to run a fixed number of iterations before convergence due to precision constraints, but the cost per iteration depends on the number of accumulators (`n`).

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the analysis, here are the natural language performance invariants that describe conditions under which the program may enter a slow path:

1. **Invariant: High Number of Accumulators**:
   - Natural Language Description: "When the number of accumulators `n` is large, the computation within each iteration of the binary search becomes expensive, as it involves recalculating the potential energy distribution across all accumulators."
   - This invariant is triggered because the loop inside `ok()` runs `n` times for each binary search iteration, and with `n` close to the upper limit, this can cause significant slowdown.

2. **Invariant: High Percent Energy Loss**:
   - Natural Language Description: "A high percentage of energy loss (`k`) during transfers may lead to a more complex and prolonged convergence of the binary search, as more iterations are needed to reach an optimal energy distribution."
   - The percentage loss impacts the calculation of `z2`, affecting how quickly the binary search can find a suitable midpoint.

3. **Invariant: Large Variance in Initial Energy Levels**:
   - Natural Language Description: "If the initial energy levels in accumulators have a large variance, more iterations and calculations are needed to equalize them, increasing the computational load significantly."
   - This is related to how widely spread the initial energy levels are, making it harder to converge to a uniform level.

By understanding these invariants, one can better anticipate scenarios that may trigger performance slowdowns and adjust the approach or optimize the code accordingly. This ensures that the application remains efficient even as input parameters vary within allowed constraints.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
It is well known that the planet suffers from the energy crisis. Little Petya doesn't like that and wants to save the world. For this purpose he needs every accumulator to contain the same amount of energy. Initially every accumulator has some amount of energy: the i-th accumulator has ai units of energy. Energy can be transferred from one accumulator to the other. Every time x units of energy are transferred (x is not necessarily an integer) k percent of it is lost. That is, if x units were transferred from one accumulator to the other, amount of energy in the first one decreased by x units and in other increased by <image> units.

Your task is to help Petya find what maximum equal amount of energy can be stored in each accumulator after the transfers.

Input

First line of the input contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 10000, 0 ≤ k ≤ 99) — number of accumulators and the percent of energy that is lost during transfers.

Next line contains n integers a1, a2, ... , an — amounts of energy in the first, second, .., n-th accumulator respectively (0 ≤ ai ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ i ≤ n).

Output

Output maximum possible amount of energy that can remain in each of accumulators after the transfers of energy.

The absolute or relative error in the answer should not exceed 10 - 6.

assistant: ### Phase 3: Implement the Natural Language Invariants in C++

Here are the C++ code snippets that implement the runtime checks for the performance-characterizing invariants derived in natural language:

1. **Invariant for High Number of Accumulators**:
   ```cpp
   void check_accumulator_count_invariant(int n) {
       if (n > 1000) {  // Assuming a threshold for slow performance
           cerr << "Warning: High number of accumulators triggering performance bottleneck!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Invariant for High Percent Energy Loss**:
   ```cpp
   void check_percent_loss_invariant(int k) {
       if (k > 70) {  // Assuming high loss percentage significantly affects performance
           cerr << "Warning: High percent energy loss triggering performance bottleneck!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Invariant for Large Variance in Initial Energy Levels**:
   ```cpp
   void check_energy_variance_invariant(const double a[], int n) {
       double max_energy = *max_element(a, a + n);
       double min_energy = *min_element(a, a + n);
       if ((max_energy - min_energy) > 800) {  // Assuming a large variance threshold
           cerr << "Warning: Large variance in initial energy levels triggering performance bottleneck!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Integrate the Checkers into the Original Program

Now, let's integrate these checker functions into the original C++ program at appropriate points without adding overhead inside tight loops:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Checker functions
void check_accumulator_count_invariant(int n) {
    if (n > 1000) {
        cerr << "Warning: High number of accumulators triggering performance bottleneck!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_percent_loss_invariant(int k) {
    if (k > 70) {
        cerr << "Warning: High percent energy loss triggering performance bottleneck!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_energy_variance_invariant(const double a[], int n) {
    double max_energy = *max_element(a, a + n);
    double min_energy = *min_element(a, a + n);
    if ((max_energy - min_energy) > 800) {
        cerr << "Warning: Large variance in initial energy levels triggering performance bottleneck!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int n, k;

int ok(double x, double a[]) {
    double z1 = 0, z2 = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (x - a[i] > 0) {
            z1 += x - a[i];
        }
        if (x - a[i] < 0) {
            double ans = 1 - (k * (double)1) / 100;
            z2 += (a[i] - x) * ans;
        }
    }
    return z1 <= z2;
}

int main() {
    std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(0);
    cout.tie(0);

    cin >> n >> k;
    double a[n];
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        cin >> a[i];
    }

    // Insert checkers after reading inputs
    check_accumulator_count_invariant(n); // Detects slowdown due to large n
    check_percent_loss_invariant(k);      // Detects slowdown due to high k
    check_energy_variance_invariant(a, n);// Detects slowdown due to large variance

    sort(a, a + n);
    double ans = 0, low = 0, high = 10000;
    int z = 0;
    
    while (low < high) {
        z++;
        double mid = (low + high) / 2;
        if (ok(mid, a)) {
            low = mid;
            ans = mid;
        } else {
            high = mid;
        }
        if (z == 999) {
            break;
        }
    }
    cout << setprecision(12) << ans;
}
```

### Explanation:

- **Check Placement**: The checks are strategically placed after reading the inputs and before the critical computation begins, thus avoiding performance overhead within the tight loops.
- **Thresholds**: Reasonable thresholds are set to capture performance bottlenecks based on the derived natural language descriptions.
- **Error Handling**: If any condition is met, the program outputs a warning message and aborts execution to prevent further slow performance scenarios.
