system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

Catherine received an array of integers as a gift for March 8. Eventually she grew bored with it, and she started calculated various useless characteristics for it. She succeeded to do it for each one she came up with. But when she came up with another one — xor of all pairwise sums of elements in the array, she realized that she couldn't compute it for a very large array, thus she asked for your help. Can you do it? Formally, you need to compute

$$$ (a_1 + a_2) ⊕ (a_1 + a_3) ⊕ … ⊕ (a_1 + a_n) \\\ ⊕ (a_2 + a_3) ⊕ … ⊕ (a_2 + a_n) \\\ … \\\ ⊕ (a_{n-1} + a_n) \\\ $$$

Here x ⊕ y is a bitwise XOR operation (i.e. x ^ y in many modern programming languages). You can read about it in Wikipedia: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or#Bitwise_operation>.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 400 000) — the number of integers in the array.

The second line contains integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7).

Output

Print a single integer — xor of all pairwise sums of integers in the given array.

Examples

Input


2
1 2


Output


3

Input


3
1 2 3


Output


2

Note

In the first sample case there is only one sum 1 + 2 = 3.

In the second sample case there are three sums: 1 + 2 = 3, 1 + 3 = 4, 2 + 3 = 5. In binary they are represented as 011_2 ⊕ 100_2 ⊕ 101_2 = 010_2, thus the answer is 2.

⊕ is the bitwise xor operation. To define x ⊕ y, consider binary representations of integers x and y. We put the i-th bit of the result to be 1 when exactly one of the i-th bits of x and y is 1. Otherwise, the i-th bit of the result is put to be 0. For example, 0101_2   ⊕   0011_2 = 0110_2.

assistant: To diagnose and derive performance-characterizing invariants from the given C program, we can follow the two-phase analysis outlined.

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Comparison of Line-Level Hit Counts:**
   - The function `bound` (lines 19-32) has significantly higher hit counts for the slow input compared to the fast input. The most notable differences are:
     - Line 21 (loop within `bound`): High hit count indicates frequent execution of this loop.
     - Lines 23, 24, 25, 27: These lines are involved in the binary search logic, suggesting repeated binary search operations.

2. **Analysis of `solve` Function Calls:**
   - The `solve` function (line 34) calls `bound` twice for each element in the array. The lines within `solve` (36-41) also show higher hits for the slow input.
   - The nested loop in `solve` iterates `n` times, and within each iteration, `bound` is called, leading to a quadratic relationship in terms of function calls when `n` is large.

3. **Interaction with Data Structures:**
   - The array `b` is sorted (line 48) for each value of `k` up to 26, suggesting a repeated sort operation, which becomes costly with increased `n`.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **Nested Loop and Conditional Complexity:**
   - **Invariant**: "When `n` is large (close to the upper constraint) and the `solve` function is invoked repeatedly in combination with the `bound` function, the program may slow down due to the quadratic growth of operations."

2. **Frequent Sorting Operations:**
   - **Invariant**: "If the array is repeatedly sorted within a loop that iterates up to 26 times, especially when `n` is large, performance may degrade due to the repeated sorting cost."

3. **Binary Search Dependency:**
   - **Invariant**: "If the binary search within the `bound` function is executed frequently due to large input size and multiple calls from nested loops, this can become a significant bottleneck."

### Summary

The slow input reveals that the program's performance deteriorates due to a combination of factors:
- The `solve` function's repeated calls to the `bound` function, leading to a quadratic increase in operations.
- The repeated sorting of the array within a loop iterated 26 times.
- High dependency on the binary search operation within `bound`, which becomes costly as `n` approaches the constraint limits.

These invariants capture the scenarios that likely cause slowdowns and provide a guide for potential optimizations, such as minimizing redundant calculations or restructuring loop logic to reduce complexity.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

But when she came up with another one — xor of all pairwise sums of elements in the array, she realized that she couldn't compute it for a very large array, thus she asked for your help. Can you do it? Formally, you need to compute

$$$ (a_1 + a_2) ⊕ (a_1 + a_3) ⊕ … ⊕ (a_1 + a_n) \\\ ⊕ (a_2 + a_3) ⊕ … ⊕ (a_2 + a_n) \\\ … \\\ ⊕ (a_{n-1} + a_n) \\\ $$$

Here x ⊕ y is a bitwise XOR operation (i.e. x ^ y in many modern programming languages). You can read about it in Wikipedia: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or#Bitwise_operation>.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 400 000) — the number of integers in the array.

The second line contains integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7).

Output

Print a single integer — xor of all pairwise sums of integers in the given array.

Examples

Input


2
1 2


Output


3

Input


3
1 2 3


Output


2

Note

In the first sample case there is only one sum 1 + 2 = 3.

In the second sample case there are three sums: 1 + 2 = 3, 1 + 3 = 4, 2 + 3 = 5. In binary they are represented as 011_2 ⊕ 100_2 ⊕ 101_2 = 010_2, thus the answer is 2.

⊕ is the bitwise xor operation. To define x ⊕ y, consider binary representations of integers x and y. We put the i-th bit of the result to be 1 when exactly one of the i-th bits of x and y is 1. Otherwise, the i-th bit of the result is put to be 0. For example, 0101_2   ⊕   0011_2 = 0110_2.

assistant: ### Phase 3: Implementing Checkers for Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the natural language invariants derived earlier, here are the C++ code snippets that implement runtime checks for these conditions:

1. **Invariant for Nested Loop and Conditional Complexity:**
   ```cpp
   void check_nested_loop_invariant(int n) {
       if (n >= 100) { // threshold based on observed slow performance
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck - high operation count in nested loops." << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Invariant for Repeated Sorting Operations:**
   ```cpp
   void check_sort_invariant(int n, int iterations) {
       if (n >= 100 && iterations == 26) { // large n and maximum iterations
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck - repeated sorting with large data." << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Invariant for Binary Search Dependency:**
   ```cpp
   void check_binary_search_invariant(int n) {
       if (n >= 100) { // large n causing frequent binary search calls
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck - excessive binary search invocations." << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Integrating Checkers into the Original Program

Now, let's integrate these runtime checks into the original C++ program at appropriate points to monitor performance conditions:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
const int N = 400005;
int b[N], a[N], n;
int ans = 0;

// Performance checkers
void check_nested_loop_invariant(int n) {
    if (n >= 100) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck - high operation count in nested loops." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_sort_invariant(int n, int iterations) {
    if (n >= 100 && iterations == 26) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck - repeated sorting with large data." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_binary_search_invariant(int n) {
    if (n >= 100) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck - excessive binary search invocations." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

inline int read() {
  int x = 0, f = 1;
  char ch = getchar();
  while (ch < '0' || ch > '9') {
    if (ch == '-') f = -1;
    ch = getchar();
  }
  while (ch >= '0' && ch <= '9') {
    x = (x << 1) + (x << 3) + (ch ^ 48);
    ch = getchar();
  }
  return x * f;
}

int bound(int x) {
  int l = 1, r = n, ret = -1;
  while (l <= r) {
    int mid = (l + r) >> 1;
    if (b[mid] >= x) {
      ret = mid;
      r = mid - 1;
    } else
      l = mid + 1;
  }
  if (ret == -1)
    return n + 1;
  else
    return ret;
}

int solve(int lim) {
  int res = 0;
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    int q = bound(lim - b[i]);
    res += (n - bound(lim - b[i]) + 1);
    if (q <= i && q <= n) --res;
  }
  return res / 2;
}

int main() {
  n = read();
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) a[i] = read();

  // Insert checks after reading input
  check_nested_loop_invariant(n);
  check_sort_invariant(n, 26);
  check_binary_search_invariant(n);

  for (int k = 0; k < 26; k++) {
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) b[i] = a[i] % (1 << (k + 1));
    sort(b + 1, b + n + 1);
    int now =
        solve(1 << k) - solve(1 << (k + 1)) + solve((1 << (k + 1)) + (1 << k));
    if (now & 1) ans = ans + (1 << k);
  }
  printf("%d\n", ans);
  return 0;
}
```

**Comments on Placement:**
- The checks are placed immediately after input reading and initialization to avoid placing them in tight loops, thus preventing additional overhead during execution.
- The checks help identify when the input conditions are likely to cause performance issues, providing useful diagnostics for optimizing and testing with a fuzzer.
