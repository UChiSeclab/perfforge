system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

Catherine received an array of integers as a gift for March 8. Eventually she grew bored with it, and she started calculated various useless characteristics for it. She succeeded to do it for each one she came up with. But when she came up with another one — xor of all pairwise sums of elements in the array, she realized that she couldn't compute it for a very large array, thus she asked for your help. Can you do it? Formally, you need to compute

$$$ (a_1 + a_2) ⊕ (a_1 + a_3) ⊕ … ⊕ (a_1 + a_n) \\\ ⊕ (a_2 + a_3) ⊕ … ⊕ (a_2 + a_n) \\\ … \\\ ⊕ (a_{n-1} + a_n) \\\ $$$

Here x ⊕ y is a bitwise XOR operation (i.e. x ^ y in many modern programming languages). You can read about it in Wikipedia: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or#Bitwise_operation>.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 400 000) — the number of integers in the array.

The second line contains integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7).

Output

Print a single integer — xor of all pairwise sums of integers in the given array.

Examples

Input


2
1 2


Output


3

Input


3
1 2 3


Output


2

Note

In the first sample case there is only one sum 1 + 2 = 3.

In the second sample case there are three sums: 1 + 2 = 3, 1 + 3 = 4, 2 + 3 = 5. In binary they are represented as 011_2 ⊕ 100_2 ⊕ 101_2 = 010_2, thus the answer is 2.

⊕ is the bitwise xor operation. To define x ⊕ y, consider binary representations of integers x and y. We put the i-th bit of the result to be 1 when exactly one of the i-th bits of x and y is 1. Otherwise, the i-th bit of the result is put to be 0. For example, 0101_2   ⊕   0011_2 = 0110_2.

assistant: To identify the performance bottlenecks and derive performance-characterizing invariants, we need to analyze the hit count data and understand the code structure. 

**Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments**

1. **Compare Line-Level Hit Counts:**
    - The lines with the most significant difference in hit counts between the slow and fast inputs are within the nested loops. Specifically, lines 25 to 42 are hit much more frequently in the slow input than in the fast input.
    - The outer bit loop (line 22) runs 32 times for both inputs. However, within this, the nested loops (lines 25 and 30) dominate the execution time as they are directly proportional to \(N\).

2. **Pinpoint Lines/Functions with More Hits:**
    - Lines 25, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42 are crucial as they involve operations on the array. These lines are hit \(O(N^2 \cdot \log N)\) times due to the sorting and searching operations inside these loops.

3. **Infer Interactions:**
    - The code calculates the XOR of pairwise sums efficiently by iterating over the bits. However, for each bit, it performs additional operations, such as sorting and searching, which are repeated \(N\) times for each bit. This results in \(O(N^2 \cdot \log N)\) complexity for the slow input and becomes a bottleneck.

**Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants**

Based on the analysis above, we can derive the following natural language invariants:

1. **Invariant 1: Large Input Size**
   - "When the input size \(N\) is large, closer to the upper constraint limit, and the program needs to perform multiple sorting and searching operations, this can result in significantly slower execution due to repetitive and costly operations on large subsets of the data."

2. **Invariant 2: Dominant Nested Loops**
   - "The presence of nested loops executing a large number of element-wise operations becomes a performance concern when coupled with operations like sorting or binary searching within each iteration. This is especially noticeable when input size approaches maximum constraints."

3. **Invariant 3: Expensive Sorting Operations**
   - "Repeated sorting of the array in the context of nested loops, especially when the array has been modified (such as taking modulo operations) and needs to be re-sorted, can detrimentally affect performance when the input size is large."

4. **Invariant 4: High Iterative Complexity**
   - "The iterative computation of results involving sorting and binary search over all elements for every bit position leads to performance degradation, particularly as input size \(N\) increases."

These invariants indicate that the combination of input size and repeated complex operations (sorting and searching in nested loops) triggers the slowdown. By focusing on reducing these operations or optimizing their execution, the performance can potentially be improved.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

$$$ (a_1 + a_2) ⊕ (a_1 + a_3) ⊕ … ⊕ (a_1 + a_n) \\\ ⊕ (a_2 + a_3) ⊕ … ⊕ (a_2 + a_n) \\\ … \\\ ⊕ (a_{n-1} + a_n) \\\ $$$

Here x ⊕ y is a bitwise XOR operation (i.e. x ^ y in many modern programming languages). You can read about it in Wikipedia: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or#Bitwise_operation>.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 400 000) — the number of integers in the array.

The second line contains integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7).

Output

Print a single integer — xor of all pairwise sums of integers in the given array.

Examples

Input


2
1 2


Output


3

Input


3
1 2 3


Output


2

Note

In the first sample case there is only one sum 1 + 2 = 3.

In the second sample case there are three sums: 1 + 2 = 3, 1 + 3 = 4, 2 + 3 = 5. In binary they are represented as 011_2 ⊕ 100_2 ⊕ 101_2 = 010_2, thus the answer is 2.

⊕ is the bitwise xor operation. To define x ⊕ y, consider binary representations of integers x and y. We put the i-th bit of the result to be 1 when exactly one of the i-th bits of x and y is 1. Otherwise, the i-th bit of the result is put to be 0. For example, 0101_2   ⊕   0011_2 = 0110_2.

assistant: ### Phase 3: Implementing the Natural Language Invariants in C++

Here, I will produce C++ code that checks the conditions we derived as performance-characterizing invariants in natural language.

1. **Invariant 1: Large Input Size**
   
   ```cpp
   void check_large_input_size(int N) {
       if (N > 100000) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large input size!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```
   
2. **Invariant 2: Dominant Nested Loops**
   
   ```cpp
   void check_nested_loops(int N) {
       if (N * N > 50000) { // This threshold is chosen considering the nested operations become costly
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - dominant nested loops!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Invariant 3: Expensive Sorting Operations**
   
   ```cpp
   void check_sorting_operations(int N) {
       if (N > 50000) { // Assuming sorting N times in the loop
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - expensive sorting operations!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

4. **Invariant 4: High Iterative Complexity**
   
   ```cpp
   void check_iterative_complexity(int N) {
       if (N > 50000) { // Complexity increases significantly for large N
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high iterative complexity!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Integrating the Checker Code into the Original Program

Now let's integrate these checks into the existing program. These checks will help us identify potential performance bottlenecks at runtime.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
using ll = long long;

void check_large_input_size(int N) {
    if (N > 100000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large input size!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_nested_loops(int N) {
    if (N * N > 50000) { // This threshold is chosen considering the nested operations become costly
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - dominant nested loops!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_sorting_operations(int N) {
    if (N > 50000) { // Assuming sorting N times in the loop
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - expensive sorting operations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_iterative_complexity(int N) {
    if (N > 50000) { // Complexity increases significantly for large N
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high iterative complexity!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void print() {}

template <class H, class... T>
void print(H&& h, T&&... t) {
    cout << h << " \n"[sizeof...(t) == 0];
    print(forward<T>(t)...);
}

int main() {
    cin.tie(0);
    ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
    ll N;
    cin >> N;

    // Place checks immediately after reading input
    check_large_input_size(N);
    check_nested_loops(N);
    check_sorting_operations(N);
    check_iterative_complexity(N);

    ll a[400010];
    for (ll i = (0); i < (N); i++) cin >> a[i];
    sort(a, a + N);
    ll ans = 0;
    for (ll bit = (31); bit >= (0); bit--) {
        ll n = (1LL << bit);
        ll n2 = n * 2;
        for (ll i = (0); i < (N); i++) {
            a[i] %= n2;
        }
        sort(a, a + N);
        ll res = 0;
        for (ll i = (0); i < (N); i++) {
            ll l1 = n - a[i], r1 = n2 - a[i] - 1;
            ll l2 = l1 + n2, r2 = r1 + n2 - 1;
            ll p1 = upper_bound(a, a + N, r1) - a;
            ll p2 = lower_bound(a, a + N, l1) - a;
            p2 = max(p2, i + 1);
            ll diff = p1 - p2;
            if (diff > 0) res += diff;
            p1 = upper_bound(a, a + N, r2) - a;
            p2 = lower_bound(a, a + N, l2) - a;
            p2 = max(p2, i + 1);
            diff = p1 - p2;
            if (diff > 0) res += diff;
        }
        if (res % 2 == 1) {
            ans += (1LL << bit);
        }
    }
    print(ans);
}
```

### Explanation

- **Placement of Checks:** The checks are placed right after reading the input size `N` to avoid overhead in the loops and before any potentially expensive operations.
- **Checking Conditions:** The conditions reflect the natural language invariants, with thresholds adapted considering reasonable constraints for performance bottlenecks. 
- **Warning and Abort:** Each condition triggers a warning with `cerr` and an `abort()` to stop execution if a bottleneck condition is detected.
