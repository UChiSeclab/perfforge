system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

You are given two strings s and t consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The length of t is 2 (i.e. this string consists only of two characters).

In one move, you can choose any character of s and replace it with any lowercase Latin letter. More formally, you choose some i and replace s_i (the character at the position i) with some character from 'a' to 'z'.

You want to do no more than k replacements in such a way that maximizes the number of occurrences of t in s as a subsequence.

Recall that a subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from the given sequence by deleting zero or more elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

Input

The first line of the input contains two integers n and k (2 ≤ n ≤ 200; 0 ≤ k ≤ n) — the length of s and the maximum number of moves you can make. The second line of the input contains the string s consisting of n lowercase Latin letters. The third line of the input contains the string t consisting of two lowercase Latin letters.

Output

Print one integer — the maximum possible number of occurrences of t in s as a subsequence if you replace no more than k characters in s optimally.

assistant: ### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

Based on the line-level hit counts for the slow and fast inputs, we can observe the following:

1. **Recursion Calls:**
   - The `max_occurance` function (line 20) is called 4,060,201 times for the slow input but only 201 times for the fast input. This indicates heavy recursion during the slow input.
   - Specifically, the recursion depth and branching (lines 29-35) occur significantly more often during the slow input.

2. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Memoization:**
   - Line 24, which checks the DP cache, is hit about 3,999,901 times during the slow run but only 200 times during the fast run. This suggests that the DP table is being accessed frequently, but may not be avoiding recursion as effectively as expected.

3. **DP Cache Miss and Result Calculation:**
   - Line 25, which returns cached results, is hit 2,646,501 times in the slow run, indicating frequent cache hits but also many computations being stored.
   - Line 27, where `ans` is initialized and subsequent calculations are performed (lines 29-35), shows a high level of computation, especially given the slow input.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Given the code structure and hit counts, we can infer several conditions under which the program likely slows down:

1. **High Recursion Depth and Frequency:**
   - **Invariant:** "When the allowed number of changes (k) approaches the length of s, and the entire string consists of characters that allow multiple subsequences of t to be formed, recursive calls grow exponentially."
   - This arises because the recursion branches heavily when numerous changes can be made, with the potential for each position in the string to be altered to support subsequences.

2. **Ineffective DP Memoization:**
   - **Invariant:** "If changes to characters in s do not significantly reduce the need for recomputation, the DP cache is accessed but does not sufficiently prune the recursion tree."
   - This can happen when many possible subsequences exist due to a homogeneous string, causing minimal pruning and requiring many scenarios to be computed and checked.

3. **Homogeneous Input String:**
   - **Invariant:** "If the input string s is composed of a single repeated character and matches one or both characters in t, the potential subsequences and transformation possibilities increase dramatically."
   - Here, every position in `s` is both a potential match and a candidate for modification, leading to a combinatorial explosion in possible states.

### Summary

The main performance bottlenecks stem from excessive recursion due to the combinatorial number of ways to form subsequences when many changes are allowed, particularly in homogeneous strings. The DP table, while used, may not effectively cache results early enough to prevent deep recursion. By tuning how recursive branches are pruned (e.g., optimizing the DP cache usage), performance could be improved.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
You are given two strings s and t consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The length of t is 2 (i.e. this string consists only of two characters).

In one move, you can choose any character of s and replace it with any lowercase Latin letter. More formally, you choose some i and replace s_i (the character at the position i) with some character from 'a' to 'z'.

You want to do no more than k replacements in such a way that maximizes the number of occurrences of t in s as a subsequence.

Recall that a subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from the given sequence by deleting zero or more elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

Input

The first line of the input contains two integers n and k (2 ≤ n ≤ 200; 0 ≤ k ≤ n) — the length of s and the maximum number of moves you can make. The second line of the input contains the string s consisting of n lowercase Latin letters. The third line of the input contains the string t consisting of two lowercase Latin letters.

Output

Print one integer — the maximum possible number of occurrences of t in s as a subsequence if you replace no more than k characters in s optimally.

In the fourth example, you can obtain the string "aaacaaa" and get the answer 15.

assistant: ### Phase 3: Implementing the Natural Language Invariants in C++

Here are the C++ runtime checks for the performance-characterizing invariants derived earlier:

```cpp
// Check for high recursion depth and frequency
void check_high_recursion_invariant(int max_changes, int size) {
    if (max_changes == size) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high recursion depth due to k equals n!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Check for ineffective DP memoization
void check_dp_memoization_invariant(int changes) {
    if (changes > 150) { // Arbitrary threshold for potential DP inefficiency
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - potential DP inefficiency!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Check for homogeneous input string
void check_homogeneous_input_invariant(const string& s, const string& t) {
    if (s.find_first_not_of(s[0]) == string::npos && (s[0] == t[0] || s[0] == t[1])) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - homogeneous input string!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrating the Checks into the Original Program

Below is the C++ program with the integrated runtime checks:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int DP[201][201][201];

class MaxOccuranceCounter {
 private:
  int size;
  int max_changes;
  string s;
  string t;

 public:
  MaxOccuranceCounter(const int n, const int k, const string s, 
                      const string t) {
    this->size = n;
    this->max_changes = k;
    this->s = s;
    this->t = t;
    memset(DP, -1, sizeof(DP));
    
    // Performance checks
    check_high_recursion_invariant(max_changes, size);
    check_homogeneous_input_invariant(s, t);
  }

  int max_occurance(int idx, int freq_t0, int changes) {
    // Additional check inside function to monitor changes count
    check_dp_memoization_invariant(changes);

    if (idx >= size) {
      return 0;
    }
    if (DP[idx][freq_t0][changes] != -1) {
      return DP[idx][freq_t0][changes];
    }
    int ans = 0;
    if (changes < max_changes) {
      ans = max(ans, freq_t0 * (t[0] == t[1]) +
                         max_occurance(idx + 1, freq_t0 + 1, changes + 1));
      ans = max(ans, freq_t0 + max_occurance(idx + 1, freq_t0, changes + 1));
    }
    ans = max(ans,
              (s[idx] == t[1]) * freq_t0 +
                  max_occurance(idx + 1, freq_t0 + (s[idx] == t[0]), changes));
    return DP[idx][freq_t0][changes] = ans;
  }
};

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cout.tie(0);
  cin.tie(0);
  int n, k;
  string s, t;
  cin >> n >> k >> s >> t;

  MaxOccuranceCounter counter(n, k, s, t);
  cout << counter.max_occurance(0, 0, 0) << endl;

  return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

- **`check_high_recursion_invariant`:** Checks if `k` equals `n`, a condition that suggests maximum recursion depth might be explored due to the number of possible changes.
- **`check_dp_memoization_invariant`:** Places a condition inside the recursive function to detect excessive changes that might indicate DP inefficiency.
- **`check_homogeneous_input_invariant`:** Before starting the main computation, it checks if the string `s` is homogeneous and matches either `t[0]` or `t[1]`, which could lead to performance issues.

These checks provide early warnings for potential performance bottlenecks by monitoring conditions that could significantly slow down the program.
