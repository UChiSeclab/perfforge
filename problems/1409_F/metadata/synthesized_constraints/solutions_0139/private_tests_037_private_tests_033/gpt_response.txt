### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

Based on the line-level hit counts for the slow and fast inputs, we can observe the following:

1. **Recursion Calls:**
   - The `max_occurance` function (line 20) is called 4,060,201 times for the slow input but only 201 times for the fast input. This indicates heavy recursion during the slow input.
   - Specifically, the recursion depth and branching (lines 29-35) occur significantly more often during the slow input.

2. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Memoization:**
   - Line 24, which checks the DP cache, is hit about 3,999,901 times during the slow run but only 200 times during the fast run. This suggests that the DP table is being accessed frequently, but may not be avoiding recursion as effectively as expected.

3. **DP Cache Miss and Result Calculation:**
   - Line 25, which returns cached results, is hit 2,646,501 times in the slow run, indicating frequent cache hits but also many computations being stored.
   - Line 27, where `ans` is initialized and subsequent calculations are performed (lines 29-35), shows a high level of computation, especially given the slow input.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Given the code structure and hit counts, we can infer several conditions under which the program likely slows down:

1. **High Recursion Depth and Frequency:**
   - **Invariant:** "When the allowed number of changes (k) approaches the length of s, and the entire string consists of characters that allow multiple subsequences of t to be formed, recursive calls grow exponentially."
   - This arises because the recursion branches heavily when numerous changes can be made, with the potential for each position in the string to be altered to support subsequences.

2. **Ineffective DP Memoization:**
   - **Invariant:** "If changes to characters in s do not significantly reduce the need for recomputation, the DP cache is accessed but does not sufficiently prune the recursion tree."
   - This can happen when many possible subsequences exist due to a homogeneous string, causing minimal pruning and requiring many scenarios to be computed and checked.

3. **Homogeneous Input String:**
   - **Invariant:** "If the input string s is composed of a single repeated character and matches one or both characters in t, the potential subsequences and transformation possibilities increase dramatically."
   - Here, every position in `s` is both a potential match and a candidate for modification, leading to a combinatorial explosion in possible states.

### Summary

The main performance bottlenecks stem from excessive recursion due to the combinatorial number of ways to form subsequences when many changes are allowed, particularly in homogeneous strings. The DP table, while used, may not effectively cache results early enough to prevent deep recursion. By tuning how recursive branches are pruned (e.g., optimizing the DP cache usage), performance could be improved.

### Phase 3: Implementing the Natural Language Invariants in C++

Here are the C++ runtime checks for the performance-characterizing invariants derived earlier:

```cpp
// Check for high recursion depth and frequency
void check_high_recursion_invariant(int max_changes, int size) {
    if (max_changes == size) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high recursion depth due to k equals n!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Check for ineffective DP memoization
void check_dp_memoization_invariant(int changes) {
    if (changes > 150) { // Arbitrary threshold for potential DP inefficiency
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - potential DP inefficiency!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Check for homogeneous input string
void check_homogeneous_input_invariant(const string& s, const string& t) {
    if (s.find_first_not_of(s[0]) == string::npos && (s[0] == t[0] || s[0] == t[1])) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - homogeneous input string!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrating the Checks into the Original Program

Below is the C++ program with the integrated runtime checks:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int DP[201][201][201];

class MaxOccuranceCounter {
 private:
  int size;
  int max_changes;
  string s;
  string t;

 public:
  MaxOccuranceCounter(const int n, const int k, const string s, 
                      const string t) {
    this->size = n;
    this->max_changes = k;
    this->s = s;
    this->t = t;
    memset(DP, -1, sizeof(DP));
    
    // Performance checks
    check_high_recursion_invariant(max_changes, size);
    check_homogeneous_input_invariant(s, t);
  }

  int max_occurance(int idx, int freq_t0, int changes) {
    // Additional check inside function to monitor changes count
    check_dp_memoization_invariant(changes);

    if (idx >= size) {
      return 0;
    }
    if (DP[idx][freq_t0][changes] != -1) {
      return DP[idx][freq_t0][changes];
    }
    int ans = 0;
    if (changes < max_changes) {
      ans = max(ans, freq_t0 * (t[0] == t[1]) +
                         max_occurance(idx + 1, freq_t0 + 1, changes + 1));
      ans = max(ans, freq_t0 + max_occurance(idx + 1, freq_t0, changes + 1));
    }
    ans = max(ans,
              (s[idx] == t[1]) * freq_t0 +
                  max_occurance(idx + 1, freq_t0 + (s[idx] == t[0]), changes));
    return DP[idx][freq_t0][changes] = ans;
  }
};

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cout.tie(0);
  cin.tie(0);
  int n, k;
  string s, t;
  cin >> n >> k >> s >> t;

  MaxOccuranceCounter counter(n, k, s, t);
  cout << counter.max_occurance(0, 0, 0) << endl;

  return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

- **`check_high_recursion_invariant`:** Checks if `k` equals `n`, a condition that suggests maximum recursion depth might be explored due to the number of possible changes.
- **`check_dp_memoization_invariant`:** Places a condition inside the recursive function to detect excessive changes that might indicate DP inefficiency.
- **`check_homogeneous_input_invariant`:** Before starting the main computation, it checks if the string `s` is homogeneous and matches either `t[0]` or `t[1]`, which could lead to performance issues.

These checks provide early warnings for potential performance bottlenecks by monitoring conditions that could significantly slow down the program.
