system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

Polycarp has n coins, the value of the i-th coin is a_i. Polycarp wants to distribute all the coins between his pockets, but he cannot put two coins with the same value into the same pocket.

For example, if Polycarp has got six coins represented as an array a = [1, 2, 4, 3, 3, 2], he can distribute the coins into two pockets as follows: [1, 2, 3], [2, 3, 4].

Polycarp wants to distribute all the coins with the minimum number of used pockets. Help him to do that.

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of coins.

The second line of the input contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) — values of coins.

Output

Print only one integer — the minimum number of pockets Polycarp needs to distribute all the coins so no two coins with the same value are put into the same pocket.

assistant: To identify and analyze performance bottlenecks, let's examine the provided code and the hit counts for both the fast and slow inputs. We'll focus on identifying expensive segments of the code and then derive performance-characterizing invariants.

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive Code Segments

1. **Loop Construct**: 
    - Lines 14-17 are nested loops that iterate over the input list `v1` twice. For the slow input, this results in 10,100 hits for line 16 and 10,000 hits for line 17, indicating that this nested loop structure is the primary cause of slowdown.

2. **Operation Analysis**:
    - The nested loop counts the frequency of each element in `v1`. Specifically, line 17 checks for equality between each pair of elements, which results in an O(n^2) time complexity for counting occurrences.

3. **Data Structure Interaction**:
    - As the input size `n` increases and the number of duplicate elements rises, the repeated operations within the nested loop significantly contribute to the slowdown.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on this analysis, we can derive the following performance-characterizing invariants:

1. **High Frequency of Duplicate Values**:
    - **Natural Language Invariant**: "When the list of coins contains a high frequency of duplicate values, particularly if the majority of the list consists of the same value, the program may enter a slow path due to repeated counting operations."
    - **Explanation**: In scenarios where many elements in the input list are duplicates, the inner loop runs more frequently, checking for equality and incrementing the count, leading to higher execution times.

2. **Large Input Size Combined with Nested Loops**:
    - **Natural Language Invariant**: "If the number of coins `n` is large (close to its upper limit of 100) and the list contains many duplicates, the nested loops for counting occurrences will significantly slow down the program."
    - **Explanation**: The input size `n` being at its maximum and having many duplicate values exacerbates the inherent O(n^2) complexity of the nested loops, causing an increase in execution time.

3. **Inefficient Use of Counting Mechanism**:
    - **Natural Language Invariant**: "The use of nested loops for counting occurrences becomes inefficient when processing a list that has a high variety of distinct values, as each value is counted separately in an O(n^2) fashion."
    - **Explanation**: Even if the list does not have many duplicates, the nested loops will redundantly count occurrences for each distinct value, leading to performance degradation.

These invariants abstractly represent conditions under which the current implementation of the program is likely to slow down. By addressing these inefficiencies, such as using a more efficient counting method (e.g., using a hash map or frequency array), the performance can be improved under these conditions.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
Polycarp has n coins, the value of the i-th coin is a_i. Polycarp wants to distribute all the coins between his pockets, but he cannot put two coins with the same value into the same pocket.

For example, if Polycarp has got six coins represented as an array a = [1, 2, 4, 3, 3, 2], he can distribute the coins into two pockets as follows: [1, 2, 3], [2, 3, 4].

Polycarp wants to distribute all the coins with the minimum number of used pockets. Help him to do that.

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of coins.

The second line of the input contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) — values of coins.

Output

Print only one integer — the minimum number of pockets Polycarp needs to distribute all the coins so no two coins with the same value are put into the same pocket.

Solution (C++ code):

assistant: Let's proceed to Phase 3 and Phase 4 by implementing and integrating the checker functions into the provided C++ code.

### Phase 3: Implementing Checker Functions in C++

Here's how we can translate the identified performance-characterizing invariants into checker code in C++:

1. **High Frequency of Duplicate Values**:
   ```cpp
   void check_high_frequency_invariant(const vector<int>& counts, int n) {
       int max_count = *max_element(counts.begin(), counts.end());
       if (max_count > n / 2) {  // Example threshold: more than half of elements are duplicates
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck triggered - high frequency of duplicate values!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Large Input Size Combined with Nested Loops**:
   ```cpp
   void check_large_input_invariant(int n) {
       if (n > 90) {  // Threshold close to the upper constraint limit
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck triggered - large input size with potential nested loop issue!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Inefficient Use of Counting Mechanism**:
   ```cpp
   void check_inefficient_counting_invariant(int unique_count, int n) {
       if (unique_count > n / 2) {  // Example threshold: significant variety of distinct values
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck triggered - inefficient counting mechanism!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Integrating Checker Functions into the Original Program

Now, let's integrate these checker functions into the original C++ solution:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Checker for high frequency of duplicate values
void check_high_frequency_invariant(const vector<int>& counts, int n) {
    int max_count = *max_element(counts.begin(), counts.end());
    if (max_count > n / 2) {  // Example threshold
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck triggered - high frequency of duplicate values!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Checker for large input size with nested loop issues
void check_large_input_invariant(int n) {
    if (n > 90) {  // Threshold close to upper limit
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck triggered - large input size with potential nested loop issue!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Checker for inefficient counting mechanism
void check_inefficient_counting_invariant(int unique_count, int n) {
    if (unique_count > n / 2) {  // Example threshold
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck triggered - inefficient counting mechanism!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    int n;
    cin >> n;

    // Perform check for large input size
    check_large_input_invariant(n);

    int x;
    vector<int> v1;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        cin >> x;
        v1.push_back(x);
    }

    int occ, count = 0;
    vector<int> v2;
    set<int> unique_values;  // To track unique elements

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        occ = v1[i];
        unique_values.insert(occ);  // Collect unique elements
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            if (occ == v1[j]) count++;
        }
        v2.push_back(count);
        count = 0;
    }

    // Perform checks for high frequency and inefficient counting
    check_high_frequency_invariant(v2, n);
    check_inefficient_counting_invariant(unique_values.size(), n);

    sort(v2.begin(), v2.end());
    int l = v2.size();
    cout << v2[l - 1];
    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation**:
- **check_high_frequency_invariant** checks if a large number of duplicates exist.
- **check_large_input_invariant** warns if the input size is close to the upper limit of constraints.
- **check_inefficient_counting_invariant** evaluates whether there is a high variety of distinct values, which might lead to inefficiency.

These checks are strategically placed to avoid overhead within the main loops and ensure they provide meaningful performance insights.
