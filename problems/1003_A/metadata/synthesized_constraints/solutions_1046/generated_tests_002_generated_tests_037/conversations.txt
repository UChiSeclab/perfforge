system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

Polycarp has n coins, the value of the i-th coin is a_i. Polycarp wants to distribute all the coins between his pockets, but he cannot put two coins with the same value into the same pocket.

For example, if Polycarp has got six coins represented as an array a = [1, 2, 4, 3, 3, 2], he can distribute the coins into two pockets as follows: [1, 2, 3], [2, 3, 4].

Polycarp wants to distribute all the coins with the minimum number of used pockets. Help him to do that.

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of coins.

The second line of the input contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) — values of coins.

Output

Print only one integer — the minimum number of pockets Polycarp needs to distribute all the coins so no two coins with the same value are put into the same pocket.

} /* line 31 slow_hit_count: 0, fast_hit_count: 0 */


assistant: ### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

Based on the hit count data for the slow and fast inputs, the following observations can be made:

1. **Outer Loop (lines 9 and 13):** The hit counts for the loop over `n` (lines 9 and 13) are significantly high for the slow input. This is expected, as both inputs have a loop over the `n` coins, but the slow input has 100 iterations compared to 2 for the fast input.

2. **Inner Loop (line 15):** The line `for (auto& a : s)` is executed 4951 times for the slow input, which is disproportionately higher than the fast input's 2 times. This suggests that the inner loop is a major factor contributing to the slowdown.

3. **Condition Check (line 16):** The condition `if (a.count(v[i]))` is checked 4852 times for the slow input but only once for the fast input. This high hit count indicates frequent checks for duplicates across the sets, likely due to many coins having the same value.

4. **Set Insertion (lines 24 and 25):** The set insertion operations on lines 24 and 25 also have high hit counts. This indicates that new pockets (sets) are frequently being created, primarily because many coins have the same value.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the above analysis, the following performance-characterizing invariants can be derived:

1. **High Frequency of Duplicate Values:**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "The program becomes slow when there are many duplicate coin values, as this leads to frequent checks and insertions in the sets representing pockets."
   - **Reasoning:** When multiple coins have the same value, the code needs to frequently verify if a coin can fit into an existing pocket without duplicates, leading to high operations in the inner loop.

2. **Large Number of Pockets (Sets):**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "If the number of distinct values is low compared to the total number of coins, resulting in many pockets being created, the performance may degrade."
   - **Reasoning:** A low variety of distinct values forces the creation of many pockets, as each unique value needs its own pocket. This increases both the number of iterations over `s` and the number of insertions.

3. **Excessive Iteration Over Sets:**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "The algorithm is inefficient when the number of pockets becomes large relative to the number of coins, causing excessive iteration over the pockets for each coin."
   - **Reasoning:** As more sets (pockets) are created, each new coin needs to be checked against these sets, increasing the computational load.

### Summary

- The main slowdown occurs due to frequent duplicate value checks and the creation of multiple pockets when there are many duplicate coin values.
- The performance degrades when the input has a low diversity of coin values, resulting in excessive iterations and checks, especially when n approaches its upper limit of 100.
- Strategies to mitigate such performance issues might include optimizing the data structure for faster duplicate checks or rethinking the algorithm to handle cases with many duplicates more efficiently.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
Polycarp has n coins, the value of the i-th coin is a_i. Polycarp wants to distribute all the coins between his pockets, but he cannot put two coins with the same value into the same pocket.

For example, if Polycarp has got six coins represented as an array a = [1, 2, 4, 3, 3, 2], he can distribute the coins into two pockets as follows: [1, 2, 3], [2, 3, 4].

Polycarp wants to distribute all the coins with the minimum number of used pockets. Help him to do that.

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of coins.

The second line of the input contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) — values of coins.

Output

Print only one integer — the minimum number of pockets Polycarp needs to distribute all the coins so no two coins with the same value are put into the same pocket.

assistant: To implement the performance-characterizing invariants derived in Phase 2 as runtime checks in C++, we will first write the checker code as standalone snippets (Phase 3) and then integrate them into the original program (Phase 4).

### Phase 3: Implement the Natural Language Invariants in C++

#### Invariant 1: High Frequency of Duplicate Values
```cpp
// Checker for high frequency of duplicate values
void check_duplicate_values(int n, const vector<int>& freq) {
    int maxFrequency = 0;
    for (int f : freq) {
        if (f > maxFrequency) {
            maxFrequency = f;
        }
    }
    if (maxFrequency > n / 2) { // Arbitrary threshold based on observation
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high frequency of duplicate values!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

#### Invariant 2: Large Number of Pockets
```cpp
// Checker for excessive number of pockets
void check_number_of_pockets(int expectedPockets, int n) {
    if (expectedPockets > n / 2) { // Arbitrary threshold assuming more than half are duplicates
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive number of pockets!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

#### Invariant 3: Excessive Iteration Over Sets
```cpp
// Checker for excessive iteration over pockets
void check_iteration_over_sets(int numberOfChecks, int n) {
    if (numberOfChecks > n * (n / 4)) { // Arbitrary threshold to detect excessive iterations
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive iteration over sets!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrate the Checkers into the Original Program

The checkers will be integrated into the C++ program at strategic points to detect performance bottlenecks. Here's the updated program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Checker for high frequency of duplicate values
void check_duplicate_values(int n, const vector<int>& freq) {
    int maxFrequency = 0;
    for (int f : freq) {
        if (f > maxFrequency) {
            maxFrequency = f;
        }
    }
    if (maxFrequency > n / 2) { // Arbitrary threshold based on observation
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high frequency of duplicate values!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Checker for excessive number of pockets
void check_number_of_pockets(int expectedPockets, int n) {
    if (expectedPockets > n / 2) { // Arbitrary threshold assuming more than half are duplicates
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive number of pockets!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Checker for excessive iteration over pockets
void check_iteration_over_sets(int numberOfChecks, int n) {
    if (numberOfChecks > n * (n / 4)) { // Arbitrary threshold to detect excessive iterations
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive iteration over sets!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    int n, val;
    vector<int> v;
    vector<set<int>> s;
    cin >> n;
    vector<int> frequency(101, 0); // Frequency array for coins
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        cin >> val;
        v.push_back(val);
        frequency[val]++;
    }

    // Check for high frequency of duplicate values
    check_duplicate_values(n, frequency);

    int numberOfChecks = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        bool test = false;
        for (auto& a : s) {
            numberOfChecks++; // Track the number of checks made
            if (a.count(v[i])) {
                // do nothing
            } else {
                test = true;
                a.insert(v[i]);
                break;
            }
        }
        if (!test) {
            set<int> ss;
            ss.insert(v[i]);
            s.push_back(ss);
        }
    }

    // Check for excessive number of pockets
    check_number_of_pockets(s.size(), n);

    // Check for excessive iteration over pockets
    check_iteration_over_sets(numberOfChecks, n);

    cout << s.size() << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

- **High Frequency of Duplicate Values:** After reading the input, the frequency of each coin value is calculated. If any value appears more than `n / 2` times, a warning is triggered.
  
- **Large Number of Pockets:** After distributing coins into pockets, if the number of pockets exceeds `n / 2`, a warning is triggered.

- **Excessive Iteration Over Sets:** The number of checks made when inserting coins into pockets is tracked. If this number becomes too high, a warning is issued. 

These checks are strategically placed to avoid overhead in the main loops and to provide insight into potential performance bottlenecks during execution.
