system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

Polycarp has n coins, the value of the i-th coin is a_i. Polycarp wants to distribute all the coins between his pockets, but he cannot put two coins with the same value into the same pocket.

For example, if Polycarp has got six coins represented as an array a = [1, 2, 4, 3, 3, 2], he can distribute the coins into two pockets as follows: [1, 2, 3], [2, 3, 4].

Polycarp wants to distribute all the coins with the minimum number of used pockets. Help him to do that.

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of coins.

The second line of the input contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) — values of coins.

Output

Print only one integer — the minimum number of pockets Polycarp needs to distribute all the coins so no two coins with the same value are put into the same pocket.

assistant: ### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

**Analysis of Line-Level Hit Counts:**

1. **Lines with Significant Difference:**
   - **Line 9 (`while (n-- > 0)`):** This loop executes 101 times for the slow input compared to only 3 times for the fast input.
   - **Line 14 (`a = count(v.begin(), v.end(), x)`):** This line is executed 100 times for the slow input, while only 2 times for the fast input.
   - **Line 15 (`if (a > max)`):** This is evaluated 100 times for the slow input, while only 2 times for the fast input.

2. **Expensive Operations:**
   - The `count` function is a major contributor to the slowdown. It is called within a loop and iterates over the entire vector `v` each time, resulting in an O(n^2) complexity. This is particularly problematic for inputs where multiple coins have the same value, as seen in the slow input.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the analysis, we can derive the following performance-characterizing invariants:

1. **Repeated Element Count:**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "When there are many coins of the same value, each occurrence requires a full scan over the list of coins to count occurrences, leading to excessive computation."
   - **Scenario Trigger:** This is especially true when a large number of coins share the same value, as it results in repeated full traversals of the coin list for counting.

2. **High Density of Duplicate Values:**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "If there is a high frequency of duplicate coin values, the program spends significant time checking and updating the maximum frequency count."
   - **Scenario Trigger:** This occurs when the number of distinct coin values is low compared to the total number of coins, causing each loop iteration to involve costly counting operations.

3. **Inefficient Counting Mechanism:**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "Using a direct counting mechanism on a list repeatedly is inefficient when many elements are similar, contributing heavily to the slow execution."
   - **Scenario Trigger:** This inefficiency is triggered when the input size `n` is near its upper limit (close to 100) with low diversity in coin values, leading to many repeated operations.

4. **Potential for Optimization:**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "If the input list has repeated elements, optimizing the counting mechanism (e.g., using a frequency map) can significantly improve performance."
   - **Scenario Trigger:** This condition suggests that if input characteristics frequently result in excessive calls to `count`, a data structure that keeps track of frequencies directly (e.g., a hash map) would prevent repeated traversals.

These invariants help identify the scenarios where the current approach is inefficient, guiding the need for a more optimal solution, such as utilizing hash tables to track frequency counts instead of repeatedly scanning the list.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
Polycarp has n coins, the value of the i-th coin is a_i. Polycarp wants to distribute all the coins between his pockets, but he cannot put two coins with the same value into the same pocket.

For example, if Polycarp has got six coins represented as an array a = [1, 2, 4, 3, 3, 2], he can distribute the coins into two pockets as follows: [1, 2, 3], [2, 3, 4].

Polycarp wants to distribute all the coins with the minimum number of used pockets. Help him to do that.

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of coins.

The second line of the input contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) — values of coins.

Output

Print only one integer — the minimum number of pockets Polycarp needs to distribute all the coins so no two coins with the same value are put into the same pocket.

assistant: ### Phase 3: Implementing Performance Invariants in C++

Below are the C++ code snippets that check for the identified performance bottlenecks based on the natural language invariants from Phase 2.

```cpp
void check_repeated_element_count(int n, const vector<int>& v) {
    unordered_map<int, int> frequency;
    for (int coin : v) {
        frequency[coin]++;
        if (frequency[coin] > n / 2) {
            cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to high frequency of duplicate elements!" << endl;
            abort();
        }
    }
}

void check_high_density_of_duplicates(const vector<int>& v) {
    unordered_set<int> unique_elements(v.begin(), v.end());
    if (unique_elements.size() < v.size() / 2) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to high density of duplicates!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_inefficient_counting_mechanism(const vector<int>& v) {
    unordered_map<int, int> frequency;
    for (int coin : v) {
        frequency[coin]++;
    }
    for (auto& entry : frequency) {
        if (entry.second > v.size() / 2) {
            cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered by inefficient counting mechanism!" << endl;
            abort();
        }
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrating Checkers into the Original C++ Code

Now, let's integrate these checks into the original C++ program, placing them strategically to ensure they highlight potential performance bottlenecks without adding significant overhead in tight loops.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Function to check if the frequency of any element is too high
void check_repeated_element_count(int n, const vector<int>& v) {
    unordered_map<int, int> frequency;
    for (int coin : v) {
        frequency[coin]++;
        if (frequency[coin] > n / 2) {
            cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to high frequency of duplicate elements!" << endl;
            abort();
        }
    }
}

// Function to check if there is a high density of duplicates
void check_high_density_of_duplicates(const vector<int>& v) {
    unordered_set<int> unique_elements(v.begin(), v.end());
    if (unique_elements.size() < v.size() / 2) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to high density of duplicates!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Function to check inefficient counting mechanism
void check_inefficient_counting_mechanism(const vector<int>& v) {
    unordered_map<int, int> frequency;
    for (int coin : v) {
        frequency[coin]++;
    }
    for (auto& entry : frequency) {
        if (entry.second > v.size() / 2) {
            cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered by inefficient counting mechanism!" << endl;
            abort();
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    long long n, a, max, x;
    cin >> n;
    vector<int> v;
    long long temp;
    max = 1;
    while (n-- > 0) {
        cin >> temp;
        v.push_back(temp);
    }
    
    // Insert performance checks after reading inputs
    check_repeated_element_count(v.size(), v);
    check_high_density_of_duplicates(v);
    check_inefficient_counting_mechanism(v);

    for (auto x : v) {
        a = count(v.begin(), v.end(), x);
        if (a > max) {
            max = a;
        }
    }
    cout << max;
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

- **Check Placement:** The checks are placed after input reading to assess the performance risks before entering the expensive counting loop. This ensures that we identify potential performance bottlenecks early.
- **Checker Functions:** Each checker function is designed to assess a different aspect of the performance issue identified in Phase 2.
- **Abort on Issues:** If any condition is met that indicates a performance problem, the program will output a warning and terminate, allowing you to catch problematic inputs during testing or fuzzing.
