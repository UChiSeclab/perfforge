=== Invariants Response ===
### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

Upon reviewing the line-level hit counts from both the fast and slow input runs, the following observations are made:

1. **Function `func` Execution:**
   - The function `func` is called 24,026,471 times on the slow input but only once on the fast input. This indicates that line 6 (function entry) and line 7 (first condition check) are heavily hit during the slow run.

2. **Recursive Calls:**
   - The recursive calls in line 13 are also heavily executed, with 12,013,235 calls on the slow input. This suggests the recursion is deeply nested due to the problem's nature, potentially exploring a large search space.

3. **Excessive Backtracking:**
   - The line that checks `crt > m` (line 8) is hit 12,013,236 times, indicating a significant number of backtracking events where the recursion exceeds `m` and needs to return.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the observations, the following natural language performance invariants are identified:

1. **Recursive Path Exploration:**
   - "When there is a large disparity between `n` and `m`, and `m` is not a simple power of 2 or 3 times `n`, the function explores a large number of recursive paths, leading to excessive backtracking and increased execution time."

2. **Recursive Depth and Branching:**
   - "If `m` has factors other than 2 or 3 that significantly contribute to its value, the recursive search space increases, resulting in numerous recursive calls and potential slowdown."

3. **High Factorization Complexity:**
   - "The performance degrades when `m` contains large prime factors or combinations of factors other than 2 and 3, making it impossible to reach through permissible transformations, leading to a large number of function calls before concluding it's impossible."

4. **Ineffective Multiplicative Paths:**
   - "When `m/n` is a large ratio that does not resolve quickly into powers of 2 and 3, the recursive algorithm may enter deep, ineffective paths exploring non-profitable multiplications."

These invariants characterize the underlying reasons for performance issues effectively. They focus on input characteristics, recursive exploration depth and factorization complexity, which align with the input constraints and potential problem spaces.

### Phase 3: Implement the Natural Language Invariants in C++

Let's implement the natural language invariants we derived into C++ checker code:

1. **Recursive Path Exploration Checker:**
   ```cpp
   void check_large_ratio_invariant(int n, int m) {
       if ((m % n) != 0) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large disparity between n and m without direct factorization by 2 and 3!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Recursive Depth and Branching Checker:**
   ```cpp
   void check_factor_invariant(int m) {
       int temp = m;
       while (temp % 2 == 0) temp /= 2;
       while (temp % 3 == 0) temp /= 3;
       if (temp != 1) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - m has factors other than 2 and 3 leading to complex recursion!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **High Factorization Complexity Checker:**
   ```cpp
   void check_complex_factorization(int n, int m) {
       int factorProduct = m / n;
       while (factorProduct % 2 == 0) factorProduct /= 2;
       while (factorProduct % 3 == 0) factorProduct /= 3;
       if (factorProduct != 1) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - complex factorization path!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

4. **Ineffective Multiplicative Paths Checker:**
   ```cpp
   void check_multiplicative_path(int n, int m) {
       int ratio = m / n;
       if (ratio > 1000) { // Arbitrary large threshold to demonstrate concept
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large ineffective multiplicative path!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Integrate Checkers into the Original C++ Program

Now, let's integrate these checkers into the provided C++ code for effective monitoring:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
const int MAX_N = (1 << 18);
int n, m;
int ans = 0;

// Checker functions
void check_large_ratio_invariant(int n, int m) {
    if ((m % n) != 0) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large disparity between n and m without direct factorization by 2 and 3!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_factor_invariant(int m) {
    int temp = m;
    while (temp % 2 == 0) temp /= 2;
    while (temp % 3 == 0) temp /= 3;
    if (temp != 1) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - m has factors other than 2 and 3 leading to complex recursion!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_complex_factorization(int n, int m) {
    int factorProduct = m / n;
    while (factorProduct % 2 == 0) factorProduct /= 2;
    while (factorProduct % 3 == 0) factorProduct /= 3;
    if (factorProduct != 1) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - complex factorization path!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_multiplicative_path(int n, int m) {
    int ratio = m / n;
    if (ratio > 1000) { // Arbitrary large threshold to demonstrate concept
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large ineffective multiplicative path!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

bool func(int crt, int cnt) {
    if (crt > m)
        return 0;
    else if (crt == m) {
        ans = cnt;
        return 1;
    }
    return func(crt * 3, cnt + 1) | func(crt * 2, cnt + 1);
}

int main() {
    cin >> n >> m;

    // Insert checker functions here to catch bottlenecks
    check_large_ratio_invariant(n, m);
    check_factor_invariant(m);
    check_complex_factorization(n, m);
    check_multiplicative_path(n, m);

    if (!func(n, 0)) {
        cout << -1 << endl;
        return 0;
    }
    cout << ans << endl;
}
```

### Explanation of Checker Integration

- **Positioning**: The checkers are placed after reading input values but before any recursive calculations begin, ensuring they do not add overhead in the recursion itself.
- **Functionality**: Each checker corresponds to a specific performance invariant and helps to detect triggers before the recursive processing starts.
- **Utility**: These checks can assist in both debugging and fuzzer-based testing by breaking execution where a performance issue might otherwise occur with certain input characteristics.
