=== Invariants Response ===
To diagnose the performance bottleneck of the given C program, let's go through a systematic analysis of the code and the hit counts provided for the fast and slow inputs. We need to identify the lines or sections of code that are contributing to the slowdown when processing the slow input, and then derive performance-characterizing invariants from these observations.

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Sieve Function Call (Lines 5-14):**
   - The `sieve` function is executed once during the slow run and involves a loop running approximately 3162 times (line 6) and another nested loop that executes 22,850,511 times (line 8). This indicates a computationally expensive operation for finding primes up to a large number.
   - None of these computations happen during the fast input processing, as the sieve is not needed (since \( n = m \)).

2. **Prime Factorization (Lines 16-34):**
   - The `pri_fact` function also shows significant execution time with loops running numerous times (line 18 with 664,580 hits). This function is responsible for factorizing the number `z` which is derived from `y/x`.
   - These computations are again absent in the fast input execution.

3. **Computation Checks and Conditions (Lines 50-68):**
   - These lines involve checks and computations related to whether the transformation of `n` to `m` is possible using only the prime factors 2 and 3. This includes checking if the number of prime factors exceeds two and ensuring the factors are 2 or 3.
   - Lines 63-68 are particularly relevant as they directly lead to returning `-1` for the slow input.

The significant difference in line hits between the slow and fast inputs suggests that the performance bottleneck arises from the complex operations in `sieve` and `pri_fact`, which are executed when the transformation involves large numbers or many steps.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **Large Prime Factorization:**
   - **Natural Language Invariant**: "When the ratio \( \frac{m}{n} \) has large prime factors or numerous prime factors, the code may experience a slowdown due to extensive prime factorization operations."
   
2. **High Exponentiation in Checks:**
   - **Natural Language Invariant**: "If the code frequently checks and computes powers of numbers to validate factorization, especially for large values of \( m \), it may lead to significant slowdowns."

3. **Extensive Sieve Calculations:**
   - **Natural Language Invariant**: "The program executes a computationally expensive sieve operation when large numbers are involved, potentially slowing down performance significantly."

### Summary of Conditions

- The slowdown is primarily triggered by the sheer size and complexity of the number `m` relative to `n`, leading to extensive sieve operations and prime factorization.
- The program is inefficient when handling cases where `m` has large or numerous prime factors that need to be checked or computed through exponentiation or other mathematical operations.
- The performance bottlenecks are exacerbated by the necessity to verify transformation feasibility via these computational paths, especially when `m` significantly differs from `n`. 

By understanding these conditions, developers can focus on optimizing or restructuring the sieve and prime factorization approach to minimize performance hits for large and complex numerical transformations.

=== Checker Response ===
To fulfill the task, we will implement runtime checks based on the previously inferred performance-characterizing invariants. Here is how we will approach it:

### Phase 3: Implement the Natural Language Invariants in C++

Based on the natural language invariants we derived in Phase 2, let's write C++ code snippets that check these conditions at runtime.

#### Invariant 1: Large Prime Factorization
**Condition**: When the ratio \( \frac{m}{n} \) has large prime factors or numerous prime factors.

```cpp
void check_large_prime_factorization(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Large prime factorization detected, potential performance bottleneck!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

#### Invariant 2: High Exponentiation Checks
**Condition**: If the program frequently checks and computes powers of numbers to validate factorization, especially for large values of \( m \).

```cpp
void check_high_exponentiation(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: High exponentiation computation detected, potential performance slowdown!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

#### Invariant 3: Extensive Sieve Calculations
**Condition**: The program executes an expensive sieve operation when large numbers are involved.

```cpp
void check_sieve_calculation(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Extensive sieve calculations detected, potential performance bottleneck!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrate Checks into the Program

Now, let's integrate the checker functions into the original C++ code. The checks should be placed strategically to avoid adding overhead inside tight loops.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

bool sc[10000007];
vector<long long int> pr;

void sieve() {
    for (long long int i = 2; i * i < 10000007; i++) {
        if (!sc[i]) {
            for (long long int j = i * i; j < 10000007; j += i) sc[j] = 1;
        }
    }
    pr.push_back(2);
    for (long long int i = 3; i < 10000007; i += 2)
        if (!sc[i]) pr.push_back(i);
}

pair<long long int, long long int> pf[10000007];

void pri_fact(long long int n) {
    long long int i, u = 0;
    for (i = 0; i < pr.size() && n != 1; i++) {
        long long int c = 0;
        while (!(n % pr[i])) {
            n /= pr[i];
            c++;
        }
        if (c) {
            pf[u].first = pr[i];
            pf[u].second = c;
            u++;
        }
    }
    if (n > 1) {
        pf[u].first = n;
        pf[u].second = 1;
    }
}

// Checker functions based on performance invariants

void check_large_prime_factorization(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Large prime factorization detected, potential performance bottleneck!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_high_exponentiation(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: High exponentiation computation detected, potential performance slowdown!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_sieve_calculation(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Extensive sieve calculations detected, potential performance bottleneck!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    long long int x, y;
    cin >> x >> y;

    if (y % x != 0) {
        cout << -1;
        return 0;
    }

    if (x == y) {
        cout << 0;
        return 0;
    }

    // Check for potential sieve bottleneck
    check_sieve_calculation(y / x > 1000000);  // Arbitrary threshold for extensive sieve

    sieve();

    long long int z = y / x;
    pri_fact(z);

    // Check for large prime factorization before further processing
    check_large_prime_factorization(pf[0].first > 100000);  // Arbitrary large prime threshold

    long long int s = pf[0].second + pf[1].second;

    // Check for high exponentiation
    check_high_exponentiation(s > 20);  // Arbitrary threshold for high exponentiation

    if ((long long int)(pow(pf[0].first, pf[0].second) * 
                        pow(pf[1].first, pf[1].second)) == z) {
        long long int ct = 0, tc = 0, i;
        for (i = 0; pf[i].first != 0; i++) {
            ct++;
            if (pf[i].first == 2) {
                tc = 0;
            } else if (pf[i].first == 3) {
                tc = 0;
            } else {
                tc = 1;
            }
        }
        if (ct > 2) {
            cout << -1;
            return 0;
        } else if (tc == 1) {
            cout << -1;
            return 0;
        }
        cout << s;
        return 0;
    } else
        cout << -1;
    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation of Integrated Checks:**

- **Sieve Calculation Check:** Placed before calling the `sieve` function to detect potential large computations.
- **Prime Factorization Check:** After `pri_fact` to ensure we are not dealing with unreasonably large prime factors.
- **High Exponentiation Check:** Before performing the power computations to ensure the operations are not too costly.

These strategic placements ensure the program detects potential slowdowns before they happen, thereby helping in debugging and optimizing performance.
