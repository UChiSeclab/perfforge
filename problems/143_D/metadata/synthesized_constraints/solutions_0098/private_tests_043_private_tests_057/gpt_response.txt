### Phase 1: Identifying Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

Based on the line-level hit counts provided for both the fast and slow inputs, we can identify the following lines of code as having significantly more hits in the slow run:

1. **Line 10 (`add_edge` function call):** In the slow run, this line is hit 3,964,080 times, indicating heavy use of edge additions to the graph structure. In contrast, it is not hit at all in the fast run.
   
2. **Lines inside `bfs()` and `dfs()` functions (especially lines 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 34, 35, 36):** These lines show that the BFS and DFS algorithms are called extensively and repeatedly in the slow run. The lines are hit millions of times, whereas they are hit significantly fewer times (or not at all) in the fast run. Notably, lines 24, 25, 35, and 36 are critical as they involve checking and updating matches and levels.

3. **Lines in the nested loops in the `main` function (lines 73, 74, 75):** These loops iterate over the entire grid, constructing the graph by checking possible conflicting positions. The slow run hits these lines a lot more due to the size of the input grid being almost square (997x997), compared to a single-column grid (997x1) in the fast input.

### Phase 2: Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the observations made during Phase 1, here are the natural language statements that describe the conditions under which the program slows down:

1. **Graph Construction Overhead:**
   - *Invariant Description:* "When both dimensions of the grid are large, the construction of the graph becomes computationally expensive due to the dense connections being established between potential soldier positions that conflict."
   - *Trigger Condition:* This condition is triggered when both `n` and `m` are large, leading to a dense bipartite graph construction, especially when both dimensions are closer to their upper limit (e.g., n and m both approaching 1000).

2. **Excessive Use of BFS and DFS:**
   - *Invariant Description:* "In scenarios where the grid is nearly square and large, the BFS and DFS operations used in the Hopcroft-Karp algorithm become the bottleneck due to extensive searching and matching over numerous nodes."
   - *Trigger Condition:* This occurs when the grid dimensions are sufficiently large to cause a high number of potential matches and searches, notably when the area (n * m) is maximized while maintaining a roughly equal distribution between `n` and `m`.

3. **High Edge Count in the Graph:**
   - *Invariant Description:* "If the number of edges added to the graph is high due to dense conflicts, further computations involving these edges slow down the execution, especially affecting the DFS operations."
   - *Trigger Condition:* This is likely when the grid is such that many potential positions for soldiers result in conflicts, maximizing the complexity of the match finding process, notably when `n` and `m` both approach their maximum constraints.

These invariants abstract the conditions under which the algorithm's performance degrades, focusing on structural aspects of the input that lead to inefficiencies in the graph-based approach used in the solution.

### Phase 3: Implementing Performance-Characterizing Invariants as C++ Checkers

Based on the natural language invariants derived earlier, we will create runtime checkers to detect potential performance bottlenecks in the program.

#### Checker 1: Graph Construction Overhead

```cpp
void check_graph_construction(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        std::cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - Graph construction overhead due to large grid dimensions." << std::endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

#### Checker 2: Excessive Use of BFS and DFS

```cpp
void check_bfs_dfs_overuse(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        std::cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - Excessive use of BFS and DFS on a large grid." << std::endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

#### Checker 3: High Edge Count in the Graph

```cpp
void check_high_edge_count(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        std::cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - High edge count in graph causing excessive DFS operations." << std::endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrating Checkers into the Original C++ Program

We will now integrate the checkers into the original program at appropriate points to ensure they do not add unnecessary overhead and accurately detect the conditions described.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using ll = long long;

int dx[] = {-2, -2, -1, -1, 1, 1, 2, 2};
int dy[] = {-1, +1, -2, +2, -2, +2, -1, +1};

void check_graph_construction(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        std::cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - Graph construction overhead due to large grid dimensions." << std::endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_bfs_dfs_overuse(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        std::cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - Excessive use of BFS and DFS on a large grid." << std::endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_high_edge_count(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        std::cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - High edge count in graph causing excessive DFS operations." << std::endl;
        abort();
    }
}

                level[i] = 0;
            }
        }
        while (!q.empty()) {
            ll u = q.front();
            q.pop();

            ret += flow;
        }
    }

    void print() {
        for (int i = 0; i < match.size(); i++) {
            if (match[i] >= 0) {
                std::cout << match[i] << " " << i << std::endl;
            }
        }

}
```

#### Explanation:

- **Graph Construction Check:** This check is placed after input reading because it is based on the grid dimensions, which are the primary factors in determining the potential graph size.
- **BFS/DFS Overuse Check:** This check is also placed after input reading to estimate potential excessive searching behavior due to a large grid area.
- **High Edge Count Check:** Placed similarly to detect if the potential number of edges becomes impractically high.

These checks are strategically positioned to give early warnings about potential performance issues without adding unnecessary overhead within loops.
