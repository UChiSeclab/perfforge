system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

One industrial factory is reforming working plan. The director suggested to set a mythical detail production norm. If at the beginning of the day there were x details in the factory storage, then by the end of the day the factory has to produce <image> (remainder after dividing x by m) more details. Unfortunately, no customer has ever bought any mythical detail, so all the details produced stay on the factory. 

The board of directors are worried that the production by the given plan may eventually stop (that means that there will be а moment when the current number of details on the factory is divisible by m). 

Given the number of details a on the first day and number m check if the production stops at some moment.

Input

The first line contains two integers a and m (1 ≤ a, m ≤ 105).

Output

Print "Yes" (without quotes) if the production will eventually stop, otherwise print "No".

(F) Program Solving the Problem Statement

#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int a, m;
  cin >> a >> m;
  while (a <= 1e8) {
    a += a % m;
    if (a % m == 0) cout << "Yes", exit(0);
  }
  cout << "No" << endl;
}


(G) The Slow & Fast Inputs

(G.1) Slow Input

8 3


(G.2) Fast Input

3 3


(H) Hit Count Information of Slow Input and Fast Input (Aggregated):

#include <bits/stdc++.h> /* line 1 slow_hit_count: 0, fast_hit_count: 0 */
using namespace std; /* line 2 slow_hit_count: 0, fast_hit_count: 0 */
int main() { /* line 3 slow_hit_count: 1, fast_hit_count: 1 */
  int a, m; /* line 4 slow_hit_count: 0, fast_hit_count: 0 */
  cin >> a >> m; /* line 5 slow_hit_count: 1, fast_hit_count: 1 */
  while (a <= 1e8) { /* line 6 slow_hit_count: 66666663, fast_hit_count: 1 */
    a += a % m; /* line 7 slow_hit_count: 66666662, fast_hit_count: 1 */
    if (a % m == 0) cout << "Yes", exit(0); /* line 8 slow_hit_count: 66666662, fast_hit_count: 1 */
  } /* line 9 slow_hit_count: 0, fast_hit_count: 0 */
  cout << "No" << endl; /* line 10 slow_hit_count: 1, fast_hit_count: 0 */
} /* line 11 slow_hit_count: 1, fast_hit_count: 0 */


assistant: ### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

Upon analyzing the line-level hit counts, it is evident that the `while` loop on line 6 is the primary contributor to the slowdown. The hit count for this line is extraordinarily high during the slow input run, with `66,666,663` hits, compared to just `1` hit in the fast input run.

- **Line 6** (`while (a <= 1e8) {`):
  This line is hit a significant number of times with the slow input. This suggests that the loop is running far more iterations for the slow input compared to the fast input, indicating a potential inefficiency.

- **Line 7** (`a += a % m;`): 
  The line inside the loop is executed nearly as many times as the loop itself, which shows that this addition operation is being performed repeatedly, but not bringing `a` to a state where the loop could terminate.

- **Line 8** (`if (a % m == 0) cout << "Yes", exit(0);`):
  This condition is checked extensively but rarely, if ever, evaluates to true for the slow input. The purpose of this line is to exit the loop when `a` is divisible by `m`, but this seems not to happen promptly, if at all, in the slow case.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants in Natural Language

Based on this analysis, we can derive conditions that characterize when the code runs slowly:

1. **Invariant 1: High Iteration Loop**  
   "When the initial number of details `a` is such that repeatedly adding the remainder of division by `m` does not quickly lead to a number divisible by `m`, the loop iterations can become excessive. This is likely when `a % m` results in a repetitive cycle or accumulation pattern that takes a long time to meet the condition where `a % m == 0`."

2. **Invariant 2: Inefficient Modulo Operation**  
   "If the modulo operation on `a` relative to `m` results in small increments (i.e., `a % m` is small compared to `a`), the increments may be too minor to efficiently reach a termination condition. Such scenarios can prolong the loop, as the increase in `a` is insufficient to bring it nearer to a multiple of `m`."

3. **Invariant 3: Stagnant Incremental Change**  
   "The performance can degrade when the sequence of modifications to `a` by accumulating `a % m` converges slowly toward a multiple of `m`. This is observed when the accumulation does not significantly alter the remainders in subsequent cycles, potentially causing many iterations."

These invariants indicate that the performance bottleneck is associated with the nature of the incremental changes in `a` not being sufficient to swiftly meet the loop's termination condition. This usually results from specific relationships between `a` and `m` that delay reaching a condition where `a` can be divisible by `m`.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
One industrial factory is reforming working plan. The director suggested to set a mythical detail production norm. If at the beginning of the day there were x details in the factory storage, then by the end of the day the factory has to produce <image> (remainder after dividing x by m) more details. Unfortunately, no customer has ever bought any mythical detail, so all the details produced stay on the factory. 

The board of directors are worried that the production by the given plan may eventually stop (that means that there will be а moment when the current number of details on the factory is divisible by m). 

Given the number of details a on the first day and number m check if the production stops at some moment.

Input

The first line contains two integers a and m (1 ≤ a, m ≤ 105).

Output

Print "Yes" (without quotes) if the production will eventually stop, otherwise print "No".

assistant: ### Phase 3: Implement the Natural Language Invariants in C++

Here are the code snippets for the performance checker functions based on the natural language invariants derived in Phase 2:

#### Invariant 1: High Iteration Loop
```cpp
void check_high_iteration_loop(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high iteration loop!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

#### Invariant 2: Inefficient Modulo Operation
```cpp
void check_inefficient_modulo_operation(int a, int m) {
    if (a % m < m / 10) { // Arbitrary threshold for small increments
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - inefficient modulo operation!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

#### Invariant 3: Stagnant Incremental Change
```cpp
void check_stagnant_incremental_change(int previous_a, int current_a) {
    if (previous_a == current_a) { // Detects if there is no change
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - stagnant incremental change!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrate Checker Code into Original Program

Now, integrate these checks into the provided C++ program at strategic points to avoid overhead within the loop:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Checker functions from Phase 3
void check_high_iteration_loop(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high iteration loop!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_inefficient_modulo_operation(int a, int m) {
    if (a % m < m / 10) { // Arbitrary threshold for small increments
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - inefficient modulo operation!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_stagnant_incremental_change(int previous_a, int current_a) {
    if (previous_a == current_a) { // Detects if there is no change
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - stagnant incremental change!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    int a, m;
    cin >> a >> m;

    // Pre-loop check for a potentially high iteration loop
    check_high_iteration_loop(a > 1e7); // Example threshold check before entering the loop

    int previous_a; // To track changes in 'a'

    while (a <= 1e8) {
        previous_a = a; // Store the previous value of 'a'
        
        // Insert check for inefficient modulo operation
        check_inefficient_modulo_operation(a, m);

        a += a % m;
        
        // Insert check for stagnant incremental change
        check_stagnant_incremental_change(previous_a, a);

        if (a % m == 0) {
            cout << "Yes";
            exit(0);
        }
    }

    cout << "No" << endl;
}
```

### Explanation of Integrated Checks

1. **High Iteration Loop Check**: This check is placed before entering the loop. It uses an arbitrary threshold (`1e7`) to estimate when `a` might cause a high number of iterations, triggering excessive loop execution.

2. **Inefficient Modulo Operation Check**: This check is placed inside the loop but before modifying `a`. It detects when the remainder from modulo operation leads to small increments, potentially slowing down progress toward a multiple of `m`.

3. **Stagnant Incremental Change Check**: This is placed immediately after updating `a`. It checks if the update to `a` made no progress (i.e., `a` did not change), which would indicate a performance issue with stagnant growth in `a`.

Each check is strategically placed to help identify performance bottlenecks while minimizing additional overhead inside the loop.
