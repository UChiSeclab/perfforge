### Phase 1: Identifying Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

Upon comparing the line-level hit counts for the fast and slow inputs, a few key observations can be made:

1. **Line 15: Loop Initialization** - This line, which initializes a loop with `now` starting from 1 up to `sqrt(v[0])`, gets hit 31,623 times for the slow input but only 2 times for the fast input. This indicates that the loop iterating over possible factors of `v[0]` is the primary source of the slowdown.

2. **Lines 18-23 and 29-34: Inner Loops** - Both these loops are part of the factor checking process and are nested within the loop on line 15. They execute significantly more often on the slow input, suggesting that the work done inside these loops is repeated many times due to the high number of iterations in the outer loop.

### Phase 2: Deriving Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Given the observations, we can derive performance-characterizing invariants for when and why the program exhibits slow behavior. These invariants focus on the conditions that cause the outer loop to iterate many times, driving up the execution time.

1. **Invariant on Distance Range**:
   - **Natural Language Description**: "If the initial difference between the smallest and largest points is large and includes multiple small divisors, the computation may slow down significantly due to extensive factor checking."
   - **Explanation**: The outer loop depends on the range of distances between the smallest and largest points. If this range is large and includes a number with many small divisors, the `now` loop will iterate extensively, causing a slowdown.

2. **Invariant on Divisor Density**:
   - **Natural Language Description**: "When the smallest distance between any two sorted points has a large prime factorization, the efficiency of the algorithm degrades as the number of potential divisors to check increases."
   - **Explanation**: If the smallest distance (`v[0]` after sorting differences) is a number with numerous small divisors, the loop will perform many additional checks, leading to a slowdown.

3. **Invariant on Point Distribution**:
   - **Natural Language Description**: "A non-uniform distribution of points, leading to large disparities in distances between them, can result in computational inefficiencies as the algorithm attempts to equalize these distances."
   - **Explanation**: When the points are distributed such that there are large variations between adjacent distances after sorting, the program will spend additional cycles attempting to balance these distances, slowing down the process.

These invariants focus on the conditions that lead to excessive iterations within the loops, highlighting how the input distribution and characteristics directly impact performance. They help capture scenarios that can lead to slow execution beyond merely considering maximum input sizes.

### Phase 3: Implementing Natural Language Invariants in C++

Let's implement the performance-characterizing invariants as runtime checks:

1. **Invariant on Distance Range**
   ```cpp
   void check_distance_range_invariant(int maxx, int minn) {
       if (maxx - minn > 1e9) { // Example threshold for large distances
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large distance range!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Invariant on Divisor Density**
   ```cpp
   void check_divisor_density_invariant(int first_diff) {
       int divisor_count = 0;
       for (int i = 1; i * i <= first_diff; ++i) {
           if (first_diff % i == 0) {
               ++divisor_count;
               if (i != first_diff / i) ++divisor_count;
           }
       }
       if (divisor_count > 1000) { // Example threshold for high divisor density
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high divisor density!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Invariant on Point Distribution**
   ```cpp
   void check_point_distribution_invariant(int* differences, int size) {
       int max_diff = *max_element(differences, differences + size);
       int min_diff = *min_element(differences, differences + size);
       if (max_diff - min_diff > 1e8) { // Example threshold for disparity
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - non-uniform point distribution!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Integrating the Checks into the Original Program

Now let's integrate these checks into the original C++ code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
const int INF = 0x3f3f3f3f;
const int N = 1e5 + 5;
int v[N];

void check_distance_range_invariant(int maxx, int minn) {
    if (maxx - minn > 1e9) { // Example threshold for large distances
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large distance range!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_divisor_density_invariant(int first_diff) {
    int divisor_count = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i * i <= first_diff; ++i) {
        if (first_diff % i == 0) {
            ++divisor_count;
            if (i != first_diff / i) ++divisor_count;
        }
    }
    if (divisor_count > 1000) { // Example threshold for high divisor density
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high divisor density!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_point_distribution_invariant(int* differences, int size) {
    int max_diff = *max_element(differences, differences + size);
    int min_diff = *min_element(differences, differences + size);
    if (max_diff - min_diff > 1e8) { // Example threshold for disparity
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - non-uniform point distribution!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    int n;
    scanf("%d", &n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) scanf("%d", &v[i]);
    sort(v, v + n);
    int minn = v[0], maxx = v[n - 1];

    check_distance_range_invariant(maxx, minn); // Check for large distance range

    for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) v[i - 1] = v[i] - v[i - 1];
    sort(v, v + n - 1);

    check_divisor_density_invariant(v[0]); // Check for high divisor density
    check_point_distribution_invariant(v, n - 1); // Check for non-uniform distribution

    int ans = maxx - minn + 1 - n;
    for (long long now = 1; now * now <= v[0]; ++now) {
        if (v[0] % now != 0) continue;
        int answer = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; ++i) {
            if (v[i] % now != 0) {
                answer = -1;
                break;
            }
            answer += v[i] / now - 1;
        }
        if (answer != -1) ans = min(answer, ans);
        int then = now;
        now = v[0] / now;
        answer = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; ++i) {
            if (v[i] % now != 0) {
                answer = -1;
                break;
            }
            answer += v[i] / now - 1;
        }
        if (answer != -1) ans = min(answer, ans);
        now = then;
    }
    printf("%d\n", ans);
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

- **Check Placement**: The checks are strategically placed after the input processing and sorting, where the data needed for each invariant is available. This ensures they do not introduce unnecessary overhead in performance-critical loops.
- **Thresholds**: The thresholds and conditions used in the checks are based on the invariants and aim to capture conditions that might lead to performance degradation.
- **Abort on Trigger**: Each check will output a warning and terminate the program if a bottleneck condition is detected, which helps in identifying problematic inputs during testing or fuzzing.
