system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

There are n points on a straight line, and the i-th point among them is located at xi. All these coordinates are distinct.

Determine the number m — the smallest number of points you should add on the line to make the distances between all neighboring points equal. 

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 100 000) — the number of points.

The second line contains a sequence of integers x1, x2, ..., xn ( - 109 ≤ xi ≤ 109) — the coordinates of the points. All these coordinates are distinct. The points can be given in an arbitrary order.

Output

Print a single integer m — the smallest number of points you should add on the line to make the distances between all neighboring points equal.

Note

In the first example you can add one point with coordinate 0.

In the second example the distances between all neighboring points are already equal, so you shouldn't add anything.

assistant: ### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Comparison of Hit Counts**: 
   - The `go` function (lines 5-11) is called 108 times for the slow input versus 3 times for the fast input.
   - The loop in `main` (line 21) iterates 44,722 times for the slow input compared to just 3 times for the fast input.
   - The while loop in `main` (line 29) executes 109 times for the slow input versus 4 times for the fast input.

2. **Pinpointed Lines**:
   - **Line 21-24**: Iterating over potential divisors of `l` (the difference between maximum and minimum coordinates) indicates a computationally heavy section. This happens more frequently for the slow input.
   - **Line 30**: The `go` function is checked in a loop. The significant hit count increase suggests this check is a bottleneck.

3. **Data Structure Interaction**:
   - The vector `v` stores potential divisor values. A large number of divisors leads to multiple calls to the `go` function, where each divisor is tested.
   - The inefficiency is exacerbated when `l` is large, leading to a high number of divisors (as seen in line 21's hit count).

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **Invariant 1**: Large Range and Many Divisors
   - **Natural Language Description**: "If the range of point coordinates (`l = max - min`) is large, there may be many divisors to check, leading to repeated calls to a costly function."
   - **Threshold**: The range `l` exceeding a certain value (relative to the number of points `n`) can be an indicator of potential slowdown.

2. **Invariant 2**: High Number of Divisor Tests
   - **Natural Language Description**: "When the number of divisors of the range `l` is large, each divisor tested may lead to a critical section of code being repeatedly executed."
   - **Threshold**: A high count of potential divisors (e.g., more than a quadratic function of `n`) may indicate an impending performance bottleneck.

3. **Invariant 3**: Frequent Function Calls within Nested Loops
   - **Natural Language Description**: "If a function that checks conditions is called many times within nested loops, performance can degrade, especially when the loop iterates over a large divisor set."
   - **Threshold**: Iterations in nested loops reaching a high threshold compared to `n` can indicate inefficient computation.

### Summary
These invariants help characterize conditions under which the program may slow down, focusing on the impact of large ranges and numerous divisors. By abstracting specific conditions and focusing on structural aspects of the code, these invariants provide a way to anticipate performance issues without specific numeric reliance on input values.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
There are n points on a straight line, and the i-th point among them is located at xi. All these coordinates are distinct.

Determine the number m — the smallest number of points you should add on the line to make the distances between all neighboring points equal. 

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 100 000) — the number of points.

The second line contains a sequence of integers x1, x2, ..., xn ( - 109 ≤ xi ≤ 109) — the coordinates of the points. All these coordinates are distinct. The points can be given in an arbitrary order.

Output

Print a single integer m — the smallest number of points you should add on the line to make the distances between all neighboring points equal.

In the first example you can add one point with coordinate 0.

assistant: ### Phase 3: Implement the Natural Language Invariants in C++

Below are the C++ code snippets that implement the performance-characterizing invariants derived in natural language:

#### Invariant 1: Large Range and Many Divisors

```cpp
void check_large_range_invariant(long long l, long long n) {
    if (l > 1000000000 && l/n > 10000) { // Example heuristic thresholds
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to large range and many divisors!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

#### Invariant 2: High Number of Divisor Tests

```cpp
void check_divisor_count_invariant(size_t divisorCount, long long n) {
    if (divisorCount > n * 10) { // Arbitrary threshold assuming the divisor count grows too much relative to `n`
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to high number of divisor tests!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrating the Checks into the Original Program

Below is the original C++ program instrumented with performance checks:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
const int N = 1e5 + 3;
long long a[N];

void check_large_range_invariant(long long l, long long n) {
    if (l > 1000000000 && l/n > 10000) { // Example heuristic thresholds
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to large range and many divisors!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_divisor_count_invariant(size_t divisorCount, long long n) {
    if (divisorCount > n * 10) { // Arbitrary threshold assuming the divisor count grows too much relative to `n`
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to high number of divisor tests!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

bool go(long long n, long long m) {
    long long i, l = (a[n - 1] - a[0]) / m;
    for (i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        if (((a[i] - a[0]) % l) != 0) return false;
    }
    return true;
}

int32_t main() {
    long long t, i, j, n, m, l, r, ans = -1;
    scanf("%lld", &n);
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) scanf("%lld", &a[i]);
    sort(a, a + n);
    l = a[n - 1] - a[0];

    // Check for large range and divisor count before entering heavy computation
    check_large_range_invariant(l, n);

    vector<long long> v;
    for (i = 1; i <= (l / i); i++) {
        if (l % i == 0) {
            if (i >= (n - 1)) v.push_back(i);
            if (i != (l / i) && (l / i) >= (n - 1)) v.push_back(l / i);
        }
    }

    // Check for high number of potential divisors
    check_divisor_count_invariant(v.size(), n);

    sort(v.begin(), v.end());
    r = 0;
    while (ans == -1) {
        if (go(n, v[r]) == true) ans = v[r] - n + 1;
        r++;
    }
    printf("%lld\n", ans);
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of Integration

1. **Location of Checks**:
   - The first check (`check_large_range_invariant`) is placed after sorting the input array and calculating the range `l`. This ensures the check is conducted based on reliable input.
   - The second check (`check_divisor_count_invariant`) is placed after collecting potential divisors into the vector `v`. This ensures the check evaluates the actual size of divisors being handled.

2. **Purpose**:
   - These checks will warn when the range or divisor count conditions are met, likely indicating a performance bottleneck, and will abort execution to prevent excessive runtime. This helps in identifying problematic input scenarios during testing or fuzzing.
