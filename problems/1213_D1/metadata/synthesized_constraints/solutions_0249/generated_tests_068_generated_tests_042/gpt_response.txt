### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

Based on the hit count information for both the slow and fast inputs, the following observations can be made:

1. **Line `13` (`for (int i = 0; i < MAXN; i++)`)**:
   - This outer loop is executed the same number of times for both the slow and fast inputs, indicating that the problem is not with this loop's iteration count itself.

2. **Line `16` (`for (int j = 0; j < n; j++)`)**:
   - The inner loop runs significantly more times for the slow input (10,200,510) compared to the fast input (1,600,080). This suggests a potential inefficiency when processing all elements in the array for each potential target number `i`.

3. **Lines `18`-`20` (while loop: `while (t > i)`)**:
   - The number of times these lines execute is drastically higher in the slow input, indicating that for many numbers, multiple division operations are needed to potentially match the target number `i`.

4. **Lines `28` (`sort(v.begin(), v.end())`)**:
   - Sorting takes place more frequently in the slow input, which could contribute to the slowdown, especially if the vector `v` becomes large often.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Given the observations, here are some natural language invariants that characterize conditions under which the program might enter a slow path:

1. **Invariant on High Division Count**:
   - **Natural Language**: "The program can become slow if too many elements require repeated divisions to match a potential target number `i`. This is especially true if a large portion of the numbers require several division operations to reduce below `i`."
   - **Condition**: This invariant suggests that when many elements in the array need to be divided multiple times to potentially match the target number `i`, the number of operations increases, leading to slowdown.

2. **Invariant on Sorting Overhead**:
   - **Natural Language**: "Frequent sorting of vectors containing division counts can lead to performance degradation, especially when many elements match a potential target number `i` partially, leading to large vectors."
   - **Condition**: If many elements match a potential target number `i` after several divisions, causing the vector `v` to grow large and requiring frequent sorting, this can significantly slow down the execution.

3. **Invariant on Large Number of Iterations in Inner Loop**:
   - **Natural Language**: "When the same operations are repeatedly applied across all elements for each potential target number `i` without early termination, the execution time can increase significantly."
   - **Condition**: This suggests that if there is no early stopping mechanism when enough equal numbers are found, the repeated full iteration over the array can slow down execution.

These invariants provide insights into how specific input patterns and execution paths contribute to the performance bottleneck. They suggest that minimizing the number of division operations and reducing unnecessary sorting can help improve performance. Additionally, implementing an early-exit strategy when `k` equal numbers are found can reduce inner loop iterations.

### Phase 3: Implementing Natural Language Invariants as C++ Checkers

Let's translate the performance-characterizing invariants into C++ checkers:

1. **High Division Count Invariant**:
   - **Checker Code**:
     ```cpp
     void check_high_division_count(int totalDivisions, int threshold) {
         if (totalDivisions > threshold) {
             cerr << "Warning: High division count triggered!" << endl;
             abort();
         }
     }
     ```

2. **Sorting Overhead Invariant**:
   - **Checker Code**:
     ```cpp
     void check_sort_overhead(int vectorSize, int sortCount, int sizeThreshold, int sortThreshold) {
         if (vectorSize > sizeThreshold && sortCount > sortThreshold) {
             cerr << "Warning: Sorting overhead triggered!" << endl;
             abort();
         }
     }
     ```

3. **Large Number of Iterations in Inner Loop**:
   - **Checker Code**:
     ```cpp
     void check_large_iterations(int iterations, int threshold) {
         if (iterations > threshold) {
             cerr << "Warning: Large number of iterations in inner loop triggered!" << endl;
             abort();
         }
     }
     ```

### Phase 4: Integrating Checkers into the Original C++ Program

Now, let's integrate these checkers into the original C++ program. The checkers will be placed in strategic points to avoid overhead in tight loops.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
const int MAXN = 1000 * 100 * 2 + 10;
long long int a[MAXN];

void check_high_division_count(int totalDivisions, int threshold) {
    if (totalDivisions > threshold) {
        cerr << "Warning: High division count triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_sort_overhead(int vectorSize, int sortCount, int sizeThreshold, int sortThreshold) {
    if (vectorSize > sizeThreshold && sortCount > sortThreshold) {
        cerr << "Warning: Sorting overhead triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_large_iterations(int iterations, int threshold) {
    if (iterations > threshold) {
        cerr << "Warning: Large number of iterations in inner loop triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false), cin.tie(0), cout.tie(0);
    int n, k;
    cin >> n >> k;
    int ans = MAXN;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        cin >> a[i];
    }

    int totalDivisions = 0;
    int sortCount = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < MAXN; i++) {
        vector<int> v;
        int cnt = 0;
        int iterations = 0; // Track number of iterations

        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            iterations++;
            int t = a[j], c = 0;
            while (t > i) {
                c++;
                t /= 2;
                totalDivisions++;
            }
            if (t == i) {
                cnt++;
                v.push_back(c);
            }
        }

        // Check for large number of iterations in the inner loop
        check_large_iterations(iterations, n * MAXN / 10); // Example threshold

        if (cnt >= k) {
            sort(v.begin(), v.end());
            sortCount++;

            // Check for sorting overhead
            check_sort_overhead(v.size(), sortCount, 50, 100); // Example thresholds

            int d = 0;
            for (int j = 0; j < k; j++) {
                d += v[j];
            }
            ans = min(ans, d);
        }
    }

    // Check for high division count
    check_high_division_count(totalDivisions, n * MAXN);

    cout << ans << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

- **`check_high_division_count`**: Placed after the main loop to avoid adding overhead within the nested loops. This checker monitors the total number of division operations.
  
- **`check_sort_overhead`**: Placed immediately before sorting, checking if the vector is too large and sorting happens too frequently.

- **`check_large_iterations`**: Checks each full iteration of the inner loop, ensuring that the program is not executing too many redundant checks.

These checkers are designed to help identify performance bottlenecks during testing and debugging phases by aborting execution when conditions leading to slowdowns are detected.
