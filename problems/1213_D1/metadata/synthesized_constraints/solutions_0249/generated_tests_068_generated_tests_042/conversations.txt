system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

The only difference between easy and hard versions is the number of elements in the array.

You are given an array a consisting of n integers. In one move you can choose any a_i and divide it by 2 rounding down (in other words, in one move you can set a_i := ⌊(a_i)/(2)⌋).

You can perform such an operation any (possibly, zero) number of times with any a_i.

Your task is to calculate the minimum possible number of operations required to obtain at least k equal numbers in the array.

Don't forget that it is possible to have a_i = 0 after some operations, thus the answer always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 50) — the number of elements in the array and the number of equal numbers required.

The second line of the input contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5), where a_i is the i-th element of a.

Output

Print one integer — the minimum possible number of operations required to obtain at least k equal numbers in the array.

assistant: ### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

Based on the hit count information for both the slow and fast inputs, the following observations can be made:

1. **Line `13` (`for (int i = 0; i < MAXN; i++)`)**:
   - This outer loop is executed the same number of times for both the slow and fast inputs, indicating that the problem is not with this loop's iteration count itself.

2. **Line `16` (`for (int j = 0; j < n; j++)`)**:
   - The inner loop runs significantly more times for the slow input (10,200,510) compared to the fast input (1,600,080). This suggests a potential inefficiency when processing all elements in the array for each potential target number `i`.

3. **Lines `18`-`20` (while loop: `while (t > i)`)**:
   - The number of times these lines execute is drastically higher in the slow input, indicating that for many numbers, multiple division operations are needed to potentially match the target number `i`.

4. **Lines `28` (`sort(v.begin(), v.end())`)**:
   - Sorting takes place more frequently in the slow input, which could contribute to the slowdown, especially if the vector `v` becomes large often.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Given the observations, here are some natural language invariants that characterize conditions under which the program might enter a slow path:

1. **Invariant on High Division Count**:
   - **Natural Language**: "The program can become slow if too many elements require repeated divisions to match a potential target number `i`. This is especially true if a large portion of the numbers require several division operations to reduce below `i`."
   - **Condition**: This invariant suggests that when many elements in the array need to be divided multiple times to potentially match the target number `i`, the number of operations increases, leading to slowdown.

2. **Invariant on Sorting Overhead**:
   - **Natural Language**: "Frequent sorting of vectors containing division counts can lead to performance degradation, especially when many elements match a potential target number `i` partially, leading to large vectors."
   - **Condition**: If many elements match a potential target number `i` after several divisions, causing the vector `v` to grow large and requiring frequent sorting, this can significantly slow down the execution.

3. **Invariant on Large Number of Iterations in Inner Loop**:
   - **Natural Language**: "When the same operations are repeatedly applied across all elements for each potential target number `i` without early termination, the execution time can increase significantly."
   - **Condition**: This suggests that if there is no early stopping mechanism when enough equal numbers are found, the repeated full iteration over the array can slow down execution.

These invariants provide insights into how specific input patterns and execution paths contribute to the performance bottleneck. They suggest that minimizing the number of division operations and reducing unnecessary sorting can help improve performance. Additionally, implementing an early-exit strategy when `k` equal numbers are found can reduce inner loop iterations.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
The only difference between easy and hard versions is the number of elements in the array.

You are given an array a consisting of n integers. In one move you can choose any a_i and divide it by 2 rounding down (in other words, in one move you can set a_i := ⌊(a_i)/(2)⌋).

You can perform such an operation any (possibly, zero) number of times with any a_i.

Your task is to calculate the minimum possible number of operations required to obtain at least k equal numbers in the array.

Don't forget that it is possible to have a_i = 0 after some operations, thus the answer always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 50) — the number of elements in the array and the number of equal numbers required.

The second line of the input contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5), where a_i is the i-th element of a.

Output

Print one integer — the minimum possible number of operations required to obtain at least k equal numbers in the array.

assistant: ### Phase 3: Implementing Natural Language Invariants as C++ Checkers

Let's translate the performance-characterizing invariants into C++ checkers:

1. **High Division Count Invariant**:
   - **Checker Code**:
     ```cpp
     void check_high_division_count(int totalDivisions, int threshold) {
         if (totalDivisions > threshold) {
             cerr << "Warning: High division count triggered!" << endl;
             abort();
         }
     }
     ```

2. **Sorting Overhead Invariant**:
   - **Checker Code**:
     ```cpp
     void check_sort_overhead(int vectorSize, int sortCount, int sizeThreshold, int sortThreshold) {
         if (vectorSize > sizeThreshold && sortCount > sortThreshold) {
             cerr << "Warning: Sorting overhead triggered!" << endl;
             abort();
         }
     }
     ```

3. **Large Number of Iterations in Inner Loop**:
   - **Checker Code**:
     ```cpp
     void check_large_iterations(int iterations, int threshold) {
         if (iterations > threshold) {
             cerr << "Warning: Large number of iterations in inner loop triggered!" << endl;
             abort();
         }
     }
     ```

### Phase 4: Integrating Checkers into the Original C++ Program

Now, let's integrate these checkers into the original C++ program. The checkers will be placed in strategic points to avoid overhead in tight loops.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
const int MAXN = 1000 * 100 * 2 + 10;
long long int a[MAXN];

void check_high_division_count(int totalDivisions, int threshold) {
    if (totalDivisions > threshold) {
        cerr << "Warning: High division count triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_sort_overhead(int vectorSize, int sortCount, int sizeThreshold, int sortThreshold) {
    if (vectorSize > sizeThreshold && sortCount > sortThreshold) {
        cerr << "Warning: Sorting overhead triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_large_iterations(int iterations, int threshold) {
    if (iterations > threshold) {
        cerr << "Warning: Large number of iterations in inner loop triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false), cin.tie(0), cout.tie(0);
    int n, k;
    cin >> n >> k;
    int ans = MAXN;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        cin >> a[i];
    }

    int totalDivisions = 0;
    int sortCount = 0;

### Explanation

- **`check_high_division_count`**: Placed after the main loop to avoid adding overhead within the nested loops. This checker monitors the total number of division operations.
  
- **`check_sort_overhead`**: Placed immediately before sorting, checking if the vector is too large and sorting happens too frequently.

- **`check_large_iterations`**: Checks each full iteration of the inner loop, ensuring that the program is not executing too many redundant checks.

These checkers are designed to help identify performance bottlenecks during testing and debugging phases by aborting execution when conditions leading to slowdowns are detected.
