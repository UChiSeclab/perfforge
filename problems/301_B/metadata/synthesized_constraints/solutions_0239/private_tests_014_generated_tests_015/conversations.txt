system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

Yaroslav is playing a game called "Time". The game has a timer showing the lifespan he's got left. As soon as the timer shows 0, Yaroslav's character dies and the game ends. Also, the game has n clock stations, station number i is at point (xi, yi) of the plane. As the player visits station number i, he increases the current time on his timer by ai. The stations are for one-time use only, so if the player visits some station another time, the time on his timer won't grow.

A player spends d·dist time units to move between stations, where dist is the distance the player has covered and d is some constant. The distance between stations i and j is determined as |xi - xj| + |yi - yj|.

Initially, the player is at station number 1, and the player has strictly more than zero and strictly less than one units of time. At station number 1 one unit of money can increase the time on the timer by one time unit (you can buy only integer number of time units).

Now Yaroslav is wondering, how much money he needs to get to station n. Help Yaroslav. Consider the time to buy and to increase the timer value negligibly small.

Input

The first line contains integers n and d (3 ≤ n ≤ 100, 103 ≤ d ≤ 105) — the number of stations and the constant from the statement.

The second line contains n - 2 integers: a2, a3, ..., an - 1 (1 ≤ ai ≤ 103). The next n lines contain the coordinates of the stations. The i-th of them contains two integers xi, yi (-100 ≤ xi, yi ≤ 100).

It is guaranteed that no two stations are located at the same point.

Output

In a single line print an integer — the answer to the problem.

assistant: To analyze the performance of the given C program, we need to consider the hit counts and the logic of the code. The key is to identify which code sections are hit significantly more during the slow input than the fast input and understand why that might happen.

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Queue Processing (Lines 31-44):** 
   - The main loop starting at line 31 is executed 50,401 times for the slow input but only 40,402 times for the fast input. This difference is significant and suggests that the BFS-like search through the potential paths between stations is more extensive for the slow input.
   - Specifically, the nested loop iterating over `k` (lines 35-44) has a substantial hit count, which indicates that many neighboring cells are being checked repeatedly.

2. **Condition Checking and Updates (Lines 36-44):**
   - The conditions on lines 36 and 37 are evaluated a very high number of times (201,600 for slow vs. 161,604 for fast), and the decision to update the minimum distance (`minD`) and enqueue a new position (lines 40-44) occurs significantly more in the slow input (50,599 vs. 40,500).

These observations suggest that the increase in hit counts is related to more extensive path exploration due to the configuration of stations and their positions.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the analysis, here are some potential invariants describing conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path:

1. **Dense Station Configuration:**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "If stations are configured in a manner where many are closely clustered or aligned in such a way that the pathfinding logic explores a large number of paths, the computation may become more intensive."
   - **Reasoning:** In the slow input, the pathfinding algorithm likely explores many possible routes because the stations are closely positioned, causing more iterations in the BFS loop.

2. **Increased Path Exploration due to Station Placement:**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "When the spatial arrangement of stations forms multiple potential paths with low travel cost between them, the algorithm may take more time to compute the optimal path."
   - **Reasoning:** The hit count analysis shows increased execution due to more possible transitions between stations, leading to increased BFS queue operations.

3. **High Branching Factor in BFS:**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "A high branching factor in the BFS exploration occurs when each station has multiple neighboring stations, leading to a higher number of enqueued positions and extended computation times."
   - **Reasoning:** The high number of checks and queue operations suggests a scenario where each position leads to multiple new candidate positions, leading to a slowdown.

These performance-characterizing invariants help capture the scenarios under which the program's efficiency can degrade, especially under configurations where station placements lead to more extensive exploration of the search space.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
Yaroslav is playing a game called "Time". The game has a timer showing the lifespan he's got left. As soon as the timer shows 0, Yaroslav's character dies and the game ends. Also, the game has n clock stations, station number i is at point (xi, yi) of the plane. As the player visits station number i, he increases the current time on his timer by ai. The stations are for one-time use only, so if the player visits some station another time, the time on his timer won't grow.

A player spends d·dist time units to move between stations, where dist is the distance the player has covered and d is some constant. The distance between stations i and j is determined as |xi - xj| + |yi - yj|.

Initially, the player is at station number 1, and the player has strictly more than zero and strictly less than one units of time. At station number 1 one unit of money can increase the time on the timer by one time unit (you can buy only integer number of time units).

Now Yaroslav is wondering, how much money he needs to get to station n. Help Yaroslav. Consider the time to buy and to increase the timer value negligibly small.

Input

The first line contains integers n and d (3 ≤ n ≤ 100, 103 ≤ d ≤ 105) — the number of stations and the constant from the statement.

The second line contains n - 2 integers: a2, a3, ..., an - 1 (1 ≤ ai ≤ 103). The next n lines contain the coordinates of the stations. The i-th of them contains two integers xi, yi (-100 ≤ xi, yi ≤ 100).

It is guaranteed that no two stations are located at the same point.

Output

In a single line print an integer — the answer to the problem.

assistant: ### Phase 3: Implementing Natural Language Invariants as Checker Code in C++

Here are the C++ code snippets to implement the performance-characterizing invariants derived from the natural language descriptions:

1. **Dense Station Configuration:**

   ```cpp
   void check_dense_configuration(int numPotentialPaths, int threshold) {
       if (numPotentialPaths > threshold) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - dense station configuration!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Increased Path Exploration due to Station Placement:**

   ```cpp
   void check_path_exploration(int numPathExplorations, int explorationThreshold) {
       if (numPathExplorations > explorationThreshold) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - increased path exploration!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **High Branching Factor in BFS:**

   ```cpp
   void check_bfs_branching_factor(int branchingFactor, int maxAllowedBranching) {
       if (branchingFactor > maxAllowedBranching) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high branching factor in BFS!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Integrating Checker Code into the Original Program

Below is the instrumented C++ program that integrates the checker code snippets at appropriate locations to monitor performance:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
const int D1[] = {1, 0, -1, 0}, D2[] = {0, 1, 0, -1};
int N, D;
int A[102], X[102], Y[102];
int is[202][202], minD[202][202];
bool inQ[202][202];
int maxD[102];
queue<pair<int, int> > Q;

// Checker functions
void check_dense_configuration(int numPotentialPaths, int threshold) {
    if (numPotentialPaths > threshold) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - dense station configuration!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_path_exploration(int numPathExplorations, int explorationThreshold) {
    if (numPathExplorations > explorationThreshold) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - increased path exploration!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_bfs_branching_factor(int branchingFactor, int maxAllowedBranching) {
    if (branchingFactor > maxAllowedBranching) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high branching factor in BFS!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    cin >> N >> D;
    for (int i = 2; i <= N - 1; ++i) cin >> A[i];
    for (int i = 0; i <= 200; ++i)
        for (int j = 0; j <= 200; ++j) {
            minD[i][j] = 0x3f3f3f3f;
            is[i][j] = D;
        }
    for (int i = 1; i <= N; ++i) {
        cin >> X[i] >> Y[i];
        X[i] += 100;
        Y[i] += 100;
        is[X[i]][Y[i]] = D - A[i];
    }
    minD[X[1]][Y[1]] = 0;
    Q.push(make_pair(X[1], Y[1]));
    inQ[X[1]][Y[1]] = true;

    int potentialPathCount = 0;
    int pathExplorationCount = 0;

    while (!Q.empty()) {
        pair<int, int> now = Q.front();
        Q.pop();
        inQ[now.first][now.second] = false;

        int branchingFactor = 0;
        for (int k = 0; k < 4; ++k) {
            if (now.first + D1[k] >= 0 && now.first + D1[k] <= 200 &&
                now.second + D2[k] >= 0 && now.second + D2[k] <= 200 &&
                minD[now.first][now.second] + is[now.first][now.second] <
                minD[now.first + D1[k]][now.second + D2[k]]) {

                minD[now.first + D1[k]][now.second + D2[k]] =
                    minD[now.first][now.second] + is[now.first][now.second];

                if (!inQ[now.first + D1[k]][now.second + D2[k]]) {
                    Q.push(make_pair(now.first + D1[k], now.second + D2[k]));
                    inQ[now.first + D1[k]][now.second + D2[k]] = true;
                    branchingFactor++;
                }
                pathExplorationCount++;
            }
        }
        potentialPathCount++;

        // Checkers for performance bottlenecks
        check_dense_configuration(potentialPathCount, 1000); // Arbitrary threshold
        check_path_exploration(pathExplorationCount, 5000); // Arbitrary threshold
        check_bfs_branching_factor(branchingFactor, 3); // Arbitrary threshold for this program
    }

    cout << minD[X[N]][Y[N]] << '\n';
}
```

### Explanation

- **Dense Station Configuration Checker:** This checks how many potential paths (states) are explored. If above a threshold, it indicates a dense configuration.
- **Increased Path Exploration Checker:** Monitors the number of times paths are explored. A higher than expected count may indicate inefficient exploration.
- **High Branching Factor Checker:** Each position may have multiple new candidate positions. If too many are found, it indicates a high branching factor.
- **Placement of Checkers:** These checks are placed outside the primary tight loop but within the broader loop to not slow down the execution while still being effective. Adjust the specific threshold values based on empirical analysis or known performance limits.
