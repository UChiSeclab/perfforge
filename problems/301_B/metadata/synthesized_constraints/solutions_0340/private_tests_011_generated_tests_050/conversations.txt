system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

Yaroslav is playing a game called "Time". The game has a timer showing the lifespan he's got left. As soon as the timer shows 0, Yaroslav's character dies and the game ends. Also, the game has n clock stations, station number i is at point (xi, yi) of the plane. As the player visits station number i, he increases the current time on his timer by ai. The stations are for one-time use only, so if the player visits some station another time, the time on his timer won't grow.

A player spends d·dist time units to move between stations, where dist is the distance the player has covered and d is some constant. The distance between stations i and j is determined as |xi - xj| + |yi - yj|.

Initially, the player is at station number 1, and the player has strictly more than zero and strictly less than one units of time. At station number 1 one unit of money can increase the time on the timer by one time unit (you can buy only integer number of time units).

Now Yaroslav is wondering, how much money he needs to get to station n. Help Yaroslav. Consider the time to buy and to increase the timer value negligibly small.

Input

The first line contains integers n and d (3 ≤ n ≤ 100, 103 ≤ d ≤ 105) — the number of stations and the constant from the statement.

The second line contains n - 2 integers: a2, a3, ..., an - 1 (1 ≤ ai ≤ 103). The next n lines contain the coordinates of the stations. The i-th of them contains two integers xi, yi (-100 ≤ xi, yi ≤ 100).

It is guaranteed that no two stations are located at the same point.

Output

In a single line print an integer — the answer to the problem.

assistant: To identify performance bottlenecks and characterize performance-invariants for the provided C program, let's analyze the slow and fast inputs through their line-level hit counts and code structure.

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Line-Level Hit Counts Analysis:**
   - Line 12 (`dfs` function): Significant difference in hit counts; slow input 5264 vs fast input 97 hits.
   - Line 16 (`for` loop): Major discrepancy in iteration count; slow input 42315 vs fast input 208.
   - Line 21 (`if` condition): Critical decision point; slow input 31784 vs fast input 136.
   - Line 22 (`dfs` recursive call): Recursion is invoked much more on the slow input; slow input 5232 vs fast input 65.

2. **Interactions and Data Structures:**
   - The `dfs` function and its recursive calls are the primary contributors to slow performance. The `for` loop iterates over all stations, and the nested `dfs` call indicates a recursive traversal of possible paths between stations.
   - The condition `(mark[i] == 0 || mark[i] < a + w[i] - dist)` is significant in deciding further exploration, suggesting that many paths are evaluated recursively.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **Recursive Depth and Path Exploration:**
   - **Invariant 1:** "If the number of stations `n` approaches its upper limit (e.g., close to 100) and the recursive search explores many possible paths due to favorable conditions (like ample time from stations), the program may slow down significantly. The recursion depth and branching factor become critical."
   - This captures the scenario where the problem's exponential nature in exploring paths becomes evident, especially when the conditions allow many recursive calls.

2. **Distance and Time Constraints:**
   - **Invariant 2:** "When the time gained from visiting intermediate stations and the distances between them allow for repeated deep explorations, the recursion may consume significantly more computation time."
   - This highlights how favorable conditions, in terms of available time and proximity between stations, exacerbate the problem's complexity.

3. **Heavy Recursion and Condition Checks:**
   - **Invariant 3:** "The performance degrades when multiple paths with adequate starting time from station 0 are explored recursively, each time recalculating and rechecking distances and available time, especially as station count `n` increases."
   - This reflects the cost of repeatedly checking and computing paths in the recursive function, indicating that increased station count leads to more potential paths being evaluated.

These invariants abstractly describe the conditions under which the program's performance might degrade, focusing on recursion, path exploration, and input characteristics. They help in identifying potential slow paths that a fuzzer could use to test and detect performance issues.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
Yaroslav is playing a game called "Time". The game has a timer showing the lifespan he's got left. As soon as the timer shows 0, Yaroslav's character dies and the game ends. Also, the game has n clock stations, station number i is at point (xi, yi) of the plane. As the player visits station number i, he increases the current time on his timer by ai. The stations are for one-time use only, so if the player visits some station another time, the time on his timer won't grow.

A player spends d·dist time units to move between stations, where dist is the distance the player has covered and d is some constant. The distance between stations i and j is determined as |xi - xj| + |yi - yj|.

Initially, the player is at station number 1, and the player has strictly more than zero and strictly less than one units of time. At station number 1 one unit of money can increase the time on the timer by one time unit (you can buy only integer number of time units).

Now Yaroslav is wondering, how much money he needs to get to station n. Help Yaroslav. Consider the time to buy and to increase the timer value negligibly small.

Input

The first line contains integers n and d (3 ≤ n ≤ 100, 103 ≤ d ≤ 105) — the number of stations and the constant from the statement.

The second line contains n - 2 integers: a2, a3, ..., an - 1 (1 ≤ ai ≤ 103). The next n lines contain the coordinates of the stations. The i-th of them contains two integers xi, yi (-100 ≤ xi, yi ≤ 100).

It is guaranteed that no two stations are located at the same point.

Output

In a single line print an integer — the answer to the problem.

assistant: ### Phase 3: Implement Natural Language Invariants in C++

Based on the natural language performance-characterizing invariants previously derived, here are the C++ code snippets to check for these conditions:

1. **Check for Recursive Depth and Path Exploration:**

```cpp
// Helper function to check for performance bottlenecks
void check_recursion_invariant(int recursionDepth, int stationCount) {
    // Assuming a threshold for recursion depth
    if (recursionDepth > 50 && stationCount > 80) { 
        cerr << "Warning: Recursion invariant triggered - High recursion depth or station count" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

2. **Check for Favorable Conditions Leading to Deep Recursion:**

```cpp
// Helper function to check for performance bottlenecks
void check_favorable_conditions_invariant(long long currentTime, long long distance) {
    // Assuming a threshold for significant favorable conditions
    if (currentTime > 5000 && distance < 10) {
        cerr << "Warning: Favorable conditions invariant triggered - Excessive exploration due to favorable conditions" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

3. **Check for Multiple Path Explorations:**

```cpp
// Helper function to check for performance bottlenecks
void check_path_exploration_invariant(int exploredPathsCount) {
    // Assuming a threshold for path explorations
    if (exploredPathsCount > 1000) { 
        cerr << "Warning: Path exploration invariant triggered - Too many paths explored" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrate Checks into the Original C++ Program

Here is the final, instrumented C++ code with the above checks integrated at appropriate points:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

void check_recursion_invariant(int recursionDepth, int stationCount) {
    if (recursionDepth > 50 && stationCount > 80) { 
        cerr << "Warning: Recursion invariant triggered - High recursion depth or station count" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_favorable_conditions_invariant(long long currentTime, long long distance) {
    if (currentTime > 5000 && distance < 10) {
        cerr << "Warning: Favorable conditions invariant triggered - Excessive exploration due to favorable conditions" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_path_exploration_invariant(int exploredPathsCount) {
    if (exploredPathsCount > 1000) { 
        cerr << "Warning: Path exploration invariant triggered - Too many paths explored" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int n, m, d;
int s1[2];
vector<pair<int, int>> st;
vector<long long> mark;
vector<long long> w;
int recursionDepth = 0;
int exploredPathsCount = 0;

bool dfs(int v, long long a) {
    recursionDepth++;
    exploredPathsCount++;
    
    check_recursion_invariant(recursionDepth, n);
    check_path_exploration_invariant(exploredPathsCount);
    
    if (v == n - 1) {
        recursionDepth--;
        return true;
    }
    
    mark[v] = a;
    bool ans = false;
    
    for (int i = 0; i < st.size(); i++) {
        long long dist = abs(st[v].first - st[i].first);
        dist += abs(st[v].second - st[i].second);
        dist *= d;
        
        check_favorable_conditions_invariant(a, dist);
        
        if (a >= dist) {
            if (i != v && (mark[i] == 0 || mark[i] < a + w[i] - dist)) {
                if (dfs(i, a + w[i] - dist)) ans = true;
            }
        }
    }
    
    recursionDepth--;
    return ans;
}

bool can(int a) {
    mark.assign(st.size(), 0);
    recursionDepth = 0;
    exploredPathsCount = 0;
    return dfs(0, a);
}

int main() {
    int i;
    cin >> n >> d;
    w.push_back(0);
    int a;
    
    for (i = 0; i < (n - 2); ++i) {
        cin >> a;
        w.push_back(a);
    }
    
    w.push_back(0);
    int b;
    
    for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        cin >> a >> b;
        st.push_back(make_pair(a, b));
    }
    
    int ans = 0;
    long long l = 0;
    long long r = 1e12;
    
    while (l <= r) {
        int m = (l + r) / 2;
        if (can(m)) {
            ans = m;
            r = m - 1;
        } else {
            l = m + 1;
        }
    }
    
    cout << ans;
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:

- **Recursion Depth and Exploration Count:** The `recursionDepth` and `exploredPathsCount` variables keep track of recursive calls and paths explored. These checks are placed at the beginning of the DFS function.
- **Favorable Conditions Checks:** Conditions where the time gained and distances allow deep recursion are checked inside the DFS loop.
- The checks are strategically placed to ensure they capture the performance bottlenecks without impacting the program's runtime under normal conditions.
