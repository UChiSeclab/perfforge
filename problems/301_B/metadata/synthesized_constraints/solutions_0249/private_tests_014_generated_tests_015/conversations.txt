system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

Yaroslav is playing a game called "Time". The game has a timer showing the lifespan he's got left. As soon as the timer shows 0, Yaroslav's character dies and the game ends. Also, the game has n clock stations, station number i is at point (xi, yi) of the plane. As the player visits station number i, he increases the current time on his timer by ai. The stations are for one-time use only, so if the player visits some station another time, the time on his timer won't grow.

A player spends d·dist time units to move between stations, where dist is the distance the player has covered and d is some constant. The distance between stations i and j is determined as |xi - xj| + |yi - yj|.

Initially, the player is at station number 1, and the player has strictly more than zero and strictly less than one units of time. At station number 1 one unit of money can increase the time on the timer by one time unit (you can buy only integer number of time units).

Now Yaroslav is wondering, how much money he needs to get to station n. Help Yaroslav. Consider the time to buy and to increase the timer value negligibly small.

Input

The first line contains integers n and d (3 ≤ n ≤ 100, 103 ≤ d ≤ 105) — the number of stations and the constant from the statement.

The second line contains n - 2 integers: a2, a3, ..., an - 1 (1 ≤ ai ≤ 103). The next n lines contain the coordinates of the stations. The i-th of them contains two integers xi, yi (-100 ≤ xi, yi ≤ 100).

It is guaranteed that no two stations are located at the same point.

Output

In a single line print an integer — the answer to the problem.

assistant: To diagnose the performance bottleneck in the provided C program, let's follow the outlined phases and provide the performance-characterizing invariants:

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Comparison of Hit Counts:**
   - The lines within the `dfs` function, particularly the loop that iterates over stations and the conditions checking potential updates to station values, have significantly higher hit counts for the slow input compared to the fast input.
   - Notably, the `while (!q.empty())` loop (line 27) and the nested loop `for (int j = 1; j < n + 1; j++)` (line 30) are heavily executed in the slow input case.

2. **Pinpointing the Bottleneck:**
   - The nested loop structure and condition checking within `dfs` are critical. Lines 35-46 are hit much more frequently in the slow input, suggesting that the algorithm is performing excessive checks or updates between stations, possibly due to a high number of reachable paths or complex graph traversal dynamics.
   - The condition `val[j] <= val[i] + stunned` (line 41) and subsequent updates are central to this, as they dictate when the state of the queue `q` is altered, leading to further iterations.

3. **Interaction with Data Structures:**
   - The `val` array and `s` set are recalculated and modified frequently, suggesting that the updating mechanism, particularly in a graph traversal context, is causing inefficiency.
   - The distance calculations combined with the updates to `val` indicate that geometric properties of the station layout (e.g., being in a line or close proximity) might exacerbate the traversal complexity.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the analysis, here are the natural language performance invariants that describe conditions leading to slow execution:

1. **Invariant 1: Dense Station Connectivity**
   - Natural language: "If the stations are laid out such that many are within close range to each other, particularly forming a linear sequence or chain, the traversal may involve excessive recalculations and updates, leading to slow performance."

2. **Invariant 2: High Branching Factor in Graph Traversal**
   - Natural language: "When there are many possible paths between stations due to their geometric layout, especially where each station can potentially lead to multiple others with minimal time cost, the traversal may become costly, increasing execution time."

3. **Invariant 3: Frequent Updates to Station Values**
   - Natural language: "If the conditions for updating station values are met frequently due to the proximity and layout of stations, the algorithm will perform numerous unnecessary updates, resulting in slower execution."

4. **Invariant 4: Extensive Use of Queue Operations**
   - Natural language: "High usage of the queue for processing station updates, particularly when new stations are frequently enqueued due to beneficial paths emerging in the traversal, can slow down the program."

These invariants focus on the relationship between the layout of stations and the traversal strategy employed by the algorithm, emphasizing how specific spatial arrangements and traversal dynamics can trigger performance pitfalls. They are aligned with the problem constraints (n ≤ 100) and abstract from specific input values, focusing instead on structural patterns likely to cause slowdowns.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
Yaroslav is playing a game called "Time". The game has a timer showing the lifespan he's got left. As soon as the timer shows 0, Yaroslav's character dies and the game ends. Also, the game has n clock stations, station number i is at point (xi, yi) of the plane. As the player visits station number i, he increases the current time on his timer by ai. The stations are for one-time use only, so if the player visits some station another time, the time on his timer won't grow.

A player spends d·dist time units to move between stations, where dist is the distance the player has covered and d is some constant. The distance between stations i and j is determined as |xi - xj| + |yi - yj|.

Initially, the player is at station number 1, and the player has strictly more than zero and strictly less than one units of time. At station number 1 one unit of money can increase the time on the timer by one time unit (you can buy only integer number of time units).

Now Yaroslav is wondering, how much money he needs to get to station n. Help Yaroslav. Consider the time to buy and to increase the timer value negligibly small.

Input

The first line contains integers n and d (3 ≤ n ≤ 100, 103 ≤ d ≤ 105) — the number of stations and the constant from the statement.

The second line contains n - 2 integers: a2, a3, ..., an - 1 (1 ≤ ai ≤ 103). The next n lines contain the coordinates of the stations. The i-th of them contains two integers xi, yi (-100 ≤ xi, yi ≤ 100).

It is guaranteed that no two stations are located at the same point.

Output

In a single line print an integer — the answer to the problem.

assistant: ### Phase 3: Implementing Performance-Characterizing Invariants as C++ Checkers

Below are the C++ checkers for the performance-characterizing invariants derived earlier:

1. **Dense Station Connectivity Checker**
   - This checker verifies if the stations are densely connected, leading to potential slowdowns due to frequent updates and recalculations in a graph traversal.

```cpp
void check_dense_connectivity_invariant(int n, const map<long long, pair<int, int>>& inv) {
    int close_pairs = 0;
    int threshold = (n * (n - 1)) / 5; // Define a threshold for close station pairs
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j <= n; ++j) {
            int distance = abs(inv.at(i).first - inv.at(j).first) + abs(inv.at(i).second - inv.at(j).second);
            if (distance < 3) { // Arbitrary distance threshold indicating dense connectivity
                close_pairs++;
            }
        }
    }
    if (close_pairs > threshold) {
        cerr << "Warning: Dense connectivity invariant triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

2. **High Branching Factor in Graph Traversal Checker**
   - This checker examines the potential branching factor by counting how many stations are directly reachable from a given station within a small time cost.

```cpp
void check_branching_factor_invariant(int n, long long d, const map<long long, pair<int, int>>& inv) {
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        int reachable_count = 0;
        for (int j = 1; j <= n; ++j) {
            if (i != j) {
                long long distance = abs(inv.at(i).first - inv.at(j).first) + abs(inv.at(i).second - inv.at(j).second);
                if (distance * d <= 2 * d) { // Arbitrary threshold for direct reachability
                    reachable_count++;
                }
            }
        }
        if (reachable_count > n / 4) { // Arbitrary threshold for high branching factor
            cerr << "Warning: High branching factor invariant triggered!" << endl;
            abort();
        }
    }
}
```

3. **Frequent Updates to Station Values Checker**
   - This checker assesses if the updates to station values are happening too frequently, indicating potential slowdowns.

```cpp
void check_frequent_update_invariant(int n, const long long val[]) {
    int update_count = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        if (val[i] > 0) { // Assuming positive values indicate updates
            update_count++;
        }
    }
    if (update_count > 3 * n / 4) { // Arbitrary threshold for frequent updates
        cerr << "Warning: Frequent updates invariant triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

4. **Extensive Use of Queue Operations Checker**
   - This checker ensures that too many operations aren't being enqueued, which could potentially cause delays.

```cpp
void check_queue_operations_invariant(int queue_op_count, int threshold) {
    if (queue_op_count > threshold) { // Arbitrary threshold for excessive queue operations
        cerr << "Warning: Extensive queue operations invariant triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrating Checkers into the Original Program

We will now integrate these checkers into the original program at appropriate points:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>

            int distance = abs(inv.at(i).first - inv.at(j).first) + abs(inv.at(i).second - inv.at(j).second);
            if (distance < 3) {
                close_pairs++;
            }
        }
    }
    if (close_pairs > threshold) {
        cerr << "Warning: Dense connectivity invariant triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

        for (int j = 1; j <= n; ++j) {
            if (i != j) {
                long long distance = abs(inv.at(i).first - inv.at(j).first) + abs(inv.at(i).second - inv.at(j).second);
                if (distance * d <= 2 * d) {
                    reachable_count++;

```

### Explanation

- **Dense Station Connectivity Check**: Executes once the station coordinates are read, ensuring the program doesn't proceed if stations are too densely packed, potentially causing slow traversal.
- **High Branching Factor Check**: Evaluates station connectivity to prevent frequent path recalculations due to excessive branching opportunities.
- **Frequent Updates Check**: Validates the number of updates in the `dfs` routine, preventing inefficient recalculations from hogging resources.
- **Queue Operations Check**: Monitors the number of operations on the queue, stopping execution if it exceeds a reasonable threshold. 

Each check helps identify potential slowdowns related to station arrangement and traversal logic.
