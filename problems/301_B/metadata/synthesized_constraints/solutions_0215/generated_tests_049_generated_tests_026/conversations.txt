system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

Yaroslav is playing a game called "Time". The game has a timer showing the lifespan he's got left. As soon as the timer shows 0, Yaroslav's character dies and the game ends. Also, the game has n clock stations, station number i is at point (xi, yi) of the plane. As the player visits station number i, he increases the current time on his timer by ai. The stations are for one-time use only, so if the player visits some station another time, the time on his timer won't grow.

A player spends d·dist time units to move between stations, where dist is the distance the player has covered and d is some constant. The distance between stations i and j is determined as |xi - xj| + |yi - yj|.

Initially, the player is at station number 1, and the player has strictly more than zero and strictly less than one units of time. At station number 1 one unit of money can increase the time on the timer by one time unit (you can buy only integer number of time units).

Now Yaroslav is wondering, how much money he needs to get to station n. Help Yaroslav. Consider the time to buy and to increase the timer value negligibly small.

Input

The first line contains integers n and d (3 ≤ n ≤ 100, 103 ≤ d ≤ 105) — the number of stations and the constant from the statement.

The second line contains n - 2 integers: a2, a3, ..., an - 1 (1 ≤ ai ≤ 103). The next n lines contain the coordinates of the stations. The i-th of them contains two integers xi, yi (-100 ≤ xi, yi ≤ 100).

It is guaranteed that no two stations are located at the same point.

Output

In a single line print an integer — the answer to the problem.

assistant: **Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments**

1. **Comparison of Hit Counts:**
   - Lines within the `dijkstra()` function exhibit significant differences in hit counts between the fast and slow inputs.
   - The most notable lines are 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 25, 26, 27, and 28. Specifically, lines 17 and 25 demonstrate a large number of executions (25,423 for slow and 20,740 for fast on line 17; 124,350 for slow and 101,185 for fast on line 25).

2. **Identifying Bottlenecks:**
   - The excessive hit counts on these lines indicate that the loops and condition checks inside the `dijkstra()` function are executed more frequently for the slow input.
   - The primary loop (beginning at line 17) represents the main iteration over the priority queue. Its performance can be affected by the number of nodes processed and the branching conditions.

3. **Analysis of Conditions:**
   - Line 21: Checks if the current distance exceeds the direct distance scaled by `d`. This suggests inefficient path exploration.
   - Line 22-24: Filters nodes based on distance and boundary constraints. Frequent executions here imply repeated checks, potentially due to revisiting nodes or processing unnecessary paths.
   - Line 25-30: Evaluates neighboring nodes, and these operations appear to repeat extensively.

**Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants**

1. **Performance Invariants in Natural Language:**

   - **Invariant 1:** "If the number of nodes explored in the Dijkstra's algorithm significantly exceeds the number of stations, resulting in repeated path evaluations, the execution may slow down. This typically occurs when the priority queue is populated with excessive nodes due to redundant calculations or inefficient heuristics."
   
   - **Invariant 2:** "When the distance calculations (based on Manhattan metrics) consistently yield values that trigger the boundary checks or relative distance checks, the function may end up performing redundant and costly distance comparisons, slowing down the algorithm."
   
   - **Invariant 3:** "If a large number of nodes are queued for processing due to multiple edge cases or conditions causing more nodes to be revisited or re-evaluated frequently, the queue operations (insertions and deletions) can become a performance bottleneck."

2. **Thresholds and Abstract Conditions:**

   - Invariant 1 can be associated with the condition where the priority queue's size remains disproportionately large compared to `n`.
   - Invariant 2 relates to scenarios where the sum of absolute differences (|xi - xj| + |yi - yj|) approaches or exceeds typical pathfinding thresholds that should be short-circuited for efficiency.
   - Invariant 3 suggests that if the number of nodes added to the queue in each cycle of the main loop consistently approaches a large fraction of `n * 4` (since each node can consider four neighbors), then inefficiencies are likely.

These invariants offer insights into the conditions that can lead to substantial slowdowns in the program execution. By establishing these guidelines, changes can be made to optimize the performance or to detect potential inefficiencies with test inputs.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
Yaroslav is playing a game called "Time". The game has a timer showing the lifespan he's got left. As soon as the timer shows 0, Yaroslav's character dies and the game ends. Also, the game has n clock stations, station number i is at point (xi, yi) of the plane. As the player visits station number i, he increases the current time on his timer by ai. The stations are for one-time use only, so if the player visits some station another time, the time on his timer won't grow.

A player spends d·dist time units to move between stations, where dist is the distance the player has covered and d is some constant. The distance between stations i and j is determined as |xi - xj| + |yi - yj|.

Initially, the player is at station number 1, and the player has strictly more than zero and strictly less than one units of time. At station number 1 one unit of money can increase the time on the timer by one time unit (you can buy only integer number of time units).

Now Yaroslav is wondering, how much money he needs to get to station n. Help Yaroslav. Consider the time to buy and to increase the timer value negligibly small.

Input

The first line contains integers n and d (3 ≤ n ≤ 100, 103 ≤ d ≤ 105) — the number of stations and the constant from the statement.

The second line contains n - 2 integers: a2, a3, ..., an - 1 (1 ≤ ai ≤ 103). The next n lines contain the coordinates of the stations. The i-th of them contains two integers xi, yi (-100 ≤ xi, yi ≤ 100).

It is guaranteed that no two stations are located at the same point.

Output

In a single line print an integer — the answer to the problem.

assistant: ### Phase 3: Implement Natural Language Invariants in C++

Here are the C++ code snippets implementing the performance-characterizing invariants derived earlier:

```cpp
// Invariant 1: Check if the number of nodes in the priority queue becomes excessive
void check_queue_size_invariant(int queueSize, int stationCount) {
    if (queueSize > stationCount * 10) {  // Threshold based on n (stations)
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive nodes in queue!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Invariant 2: Check if there are excessive distance calculations
void check_distance_calculation_invariant(int distanceCalculations, int stationCount) {
    if (distanceCalculations > stationCount * 1000) {  // Arbitrary high threshold
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive distance calculations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Invariant 3: Check if the priority queue is repeatedly processing nodes
void check_node_processing_invariant(int nodeProcessedCount, int stationCount) {
    if (nodeProcessedCount > stationCount * 20) {  // Threshold based on n (stations)
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive node processing!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrate Conditional Checks into the C++ Program

Now, we integrate these checks into the original program at appropriate points to detect potential performance bottlenecks:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
const int N = 502;
int n, d, a[N];
int x[N], y[N];
map<pair<int, int>, int> dis, mp;
struct Nod {
    int x, y, dis;
    bool operator<(const Nod& o) const { return dis > o.dis; }
};
int dx[4] = {-1, 1, 0, 0};
int dy[4] = {0, 0, -1, 1};

// Check if the number of nodes in the priority queue becomes excessive
void check_queue_size_invariant(int queueSize, int stationCount) {
    if (queueSize > stationCount * 10) {  // Threshold based on n (stations)
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive nodes in queue!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Check if there are excessive distance calculations
void check_distance_calculation_invariant(int distanceCalculations, int stationCount) {
    if (distanceCalculations > stationCount * 1000) {  // Arbitrary high threshold
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive distance calculations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Check if the priority queue is repeatedly processing nodes
void check_node_processing_invariant(int nodeProcessedCount, int stationCount) {
    if (nodeProcessedCount > stationCount * 20) {  // Threshold based on n (stations)
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive node processing!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void dijkstra() {
    priority_queue<Nod> q;
    q.push((Nod){x[n], y[n], 0});
    dis[make_pair(x[n], y[n])] = 0;
    
    int distanceCalculations = 0;
    int nodeProcessedCount = 0;
    
    while (q.size()) {
        // Check queue size invariant before processing
        check_queue_size_invariant(q.size(), n);

        Nod tmp = q.top();
        q.pop();
        int X = tmp.x, Y = tmp.y;
        nodeProcessedCount++;

        if (tmp.dis > d * (abs(x[1] - x[n]) + abs(y[1] - y[n]))) continue;
        if (tmp.dis > dis[make_pair(X, Y)] || X < -100 || X > 100 || Y < -100 || Y > 100)
            continue;

        for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
            int nx = X + dx[i], ny = Y + dy[i];
            int v = d + max(0, tmp.dis - mp[make_pair(X, Y)]);
            distanceCalculations++;

            // Check distance calculation invariant
            check_distance_calculation_invariant(distanceCalculations, n);

            if (!dis.count(make_pair(nx, ny)) || dis[make_pair(nx, ny)] > v) {
                dis[make_pair(nx, ny)] = v;
                q.push((Nod){nx, ny, v});
            }
        }
    }

    // Check node processing invariant after loop
    check_node_processing_invariant(nodeProcessedCount, n);

    printf("%d\n", dis[make_pair(x[1], y[1])]);
}

int main() {
    scanf("%d%d", &n, &d);
    for (int i = 2; i <= n - 1; i++) scanf("%d", &a[i]);
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) scanf("%d%d", &x[i], &y[i]);
    for (int i = 2; i < n; i++) mp[make_pair(x[i], y[i])] = a[i];
    dijkstra();
}
```

### Explanation of Integration

- **Queue Size Check:** Placed before processing nodes in the priority queue to ensure the queue does not grow excessively.
- **Distance Calculation Check:** Placed within the loop that calculates distances, ensuring it does not execute too many times.
- **Node Processing Check:** Placed after node processing or in the main loop to ensure nodes are not redundantly processed.

These checks help ensure the program does not slow down unexpectedly due to excessive operations.
