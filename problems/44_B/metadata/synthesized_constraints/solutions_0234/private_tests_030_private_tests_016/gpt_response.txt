=== Invariants Response ===
### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

- **Line 12 (`for (int i = 0; i <= c && n - 2 * i >= 0; i++)`):** This loop iterates up to `c` times. For the slow input (`c = 5000`), this loop runs 5002 times, while for the fast input, it only runs 2 times.
  
- **Line 15 (`for (int j = 0; j <= b; j++)`):** This nested loop within the outer loop is drastically more expensive for the slow input. It executes 12,510,002 times compared to 0 times for the fast input. This suggests that the main performance bottleneck is within this nested loop, especially since it is unbounded within the `i` loop.

The key issue is the nested loop on line 15, which gets executed a large number of times for the slow input due to the combination of parameters `b` and `c`.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **Invariant: High Iteration Count in Nested Loops**
   - **Description:** "When `c` (number of 2-liter bottles) is large and `b` (number of 1-liter bottles) allows for many combinations of 1-liter bottles to be subtracted from the remaining liters (`n - 2 * i`), the nested loop iterating over `b` can run excessively, resulting in significant slowdowns."
   - **Explanation:** This condition describes the situation where the input parameters lead to excessive iterations in the nested loop, particularly when the capacity to use 2-liter bottles is maximized, and there are still many 1-liter bottles available to cover the deficit.

2. **Invariant: Excessive Combinations of 1-liter Bottles**
   - **Description:** "If the number of 1-liter bottles `b` is near its maximum, and there are no 0.5-liter bottles to use (`a` is small or zero), the search space for combinations that sum to the remaining liters after using the maximum possible 2-liter bottles becomes large, thus increasing execution time."
   - **Explanation:** This highlights how the lack of smaller bottle sizes (0.5-liter) combined with a high number of 1-liter bottles leads to a large combinatorial space that the program must explore, slowing down execution.

3. **Invariant: Minimal Use of 0.5-liter Bottles**
   - **Description:** "When `a` (number of 0.5-liter bottles) is zero or very small, and `c` and `b` are both large, the reliance on 1-liter bottles for precise adjustments without 0.5-liter bottles increases computation time."
   - **Explanation:** This condition underscores the importance of having smaller bottle increments available to quickly reach the exact required cola volume without exhaustive checking of combinations.

By characterizing these conditions, the cause of the slowdown can be linked to the input patterns involving the maximum allowed bottles in certain sizes and the resulting large number of possible combinations that the program must evaluate.

### Phase 3: Implementing Performance-Characterizing Invariants as C++ Checkers

Based on the natural language invariants derived earlier, here are the C++ checkers:

1. **Invariant: High Iteration Count in Nested Loops**
   ```cpp
   void check_high_iteration_count_invariant(int b, int c) {
       if (c > 2500 && b > 2500) { // Check for large values that could cause excessive loop iterations
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to high iteration count in nested loops!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Invariant: Excessive Combinations of 1-liter Bottles**
   ```cpp
   void check_excessive_combinations_invariant(int a, int b, int c) {
       if (b > 4500 && a == 0 && c > 2500) { // When 1-liter bottles are high, and no 0.5-liter bottles are available
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to excessive combinations of 1-liter bottles!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Invariant: Minimal Use of 0.5-liter Bottles**
   ```cpp
   void check_minimal_half_liter_bottles_invariant(int a, int b, int c) {
       if (a == 0 && b > 4500 && c > 2500) { // No 0.5-liter bottles with high counts of 1 and 2-liter bottles
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to minimal use of 0.5-liter bottles!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Integrating Checkers into the Original Program

Below is the instrumented C++ program with the checkers integrated:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
const double PI = acos(-1.0);
const double eps = 1e-6;
const int inf = 2147483647;
const int maxn = 10000;
int n, a, b, c;
int ans;

// Checkers for performance bottlenecks
void check_high_iteration_count_invariant(int b, int c) {
    if (c > 2500 && b > 2500) { // Check for large values that could cause excessive loop iterations
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to high iteration count in nested loops!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_excessive_combinations_invariant(int a, int b, int c) {
    if (b > 4500 && a == 0 && c > 2500) { // When 1-liter bottles are high, and no 0.5-liter bottles are available
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to excessive combinations of 1-liter bottles!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_minimal_half_liter_bottles_invariant(int a, int b, int c) {
    if (a == 0 && b > 4500 && c > 2500) { // No 0.5-liter bottles with high counts of 1 and 2-liter bottles
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to minimal use of 0.5-liter bottles!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    scanf("%d%d%d%d", &n, &a, &b, &c);

    // Integrate performance checkers
    check_high_iteration_count_invariant(b, c);
    check_excessive_combinations_invariant(a, b, c);
    check_minimal_half_liter_bottles_invariant(a, b, c);

    int d = a / 2;
    for (int i = 0; i <= c && n - 2 * i >= 0; i++) {
        int res = n - 2 * i;
        if (d + b < res) continue;
        for (int j = 0; j <= b; j++) {
            int rr = res - j;
            if (rr <= d && rr >= 0) ans++;
        }
    }
    printf("%d\n", ans);
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of Inserted Checkers

- **High Iteration Count Checker**: Before entering the loops, we check if both `b` and `c` are large, which can lead to a high iteration count.
- **Excessive Combinations Checker**: Ensures that if `a` is zero, `b` is high, and `c` allows for many combinations, the program detects potential slowdowns.
- **Minimal Half-Liter Bottles Checker**: Checks if zero 0.5-liter bottles combined with high counts of 1 and 2-liter bottles lead to a performance issue.

These checkers help prevent scenarios that can slow down the program significantly by aborting execution when potential performance bottlenecks are detected.
