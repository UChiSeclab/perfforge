system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

To celebrate the opening of the Winter Computer School the organizers decided to buy in n liters of cola. However, an unexpected difficulty occurred in the shop: it turned out that cola is sold in bottles 0.5, 1 and 2 liters in volume. At that, there are exactly a bottles 0.5 in volume, b one-liter bottles and c of two-liter ones. The organizers have enough money to buy any amount of cola. What did cause the heated arguments was how many bottles of every kind to buy, as this question is pivotal for the distribution of cola among the participants (and organizers as well).

Thus, while the organizers are having the argument, discussing different variants of buying cola, the Winter School can't start. Your task is to count the number of all the possible ways to buy exactly n liters of cola and persuade the organizers that this number is too large, and if they keep on arguing, then the Winter Computer School will have to be organized in summer.

All the bottles of cola are considered indistinguishable, i.e. two variants of buying are different from each other only if they differ in the number of bottles of at least one kind.

Input

The first line contains four integers — n, a, b, c (1 ≤ n ≤ 10000, 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 5000).

Output

Print the unique number — the solution to the problem. If it is impossible to buy exactly n liters of cola, print 0.

assistant: ### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

- **Line 12 (`for (int i = 0; i <= c && n - 2 * i >= 0; i++)`):** This loop iterates up to `c` times. For the slow input (`c = 5000`), this loop runs 5002 times, while for the fast input, it only runs 2 times.
  
- **Line 15 (`for (int j = 0; j <= b; j++)`):** This nested loop within the outer loop is drastically more expensive for the slow input. It executes 12,510,002 times compared to 0 times for the fast input. This suggests that the main performance bottleneck is within this nested loop, especially since it is unbounded within the `i` loop.

The key issue is the nested loop on line 15, which gets executed a large number of times for the slow input due to the combination of parameters `b` and `c`.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **Invariant: High Iteration Count in Nested Loops**
   - **Description:** "When `c` (number of 2-liter bottles) is large and `b` (number of 1-liter bottles) allows for many combinations of 1-liter bottles to be subtracted from the remaining liters (`n - 2 * i`), the nested loop iterating over `b` can run excessively, resulting in significant slowdowns."
   - **Explanation:** This condition describes the situation where the input parameters lead to excessive iterations in the nested loop, particularly when the capacity to use 2-liter bottles is maximized, and there are still many 1-liter bottles available to cover the deficit.

2. **Invariant: Excessive Combinations of 1-liter Bottles**
   - **Description:** "If the number of 1-liter bottles `b` is near its maximum, and there are no 0.5-liter bottles to use (`a` is small or zero), the search space for combinations that sum to the remaining liters after using the maximum possible 2-liter bottles becomes large, thus increasing execution time."
   - **Explanation:** This highlights how the lack of smaller bottle sizes (0.5-liter) combined with a high number of 1-liter bottles leads to a large combinatorial space that the program must explore, slowing down execution.

3. **Invariant: Minimal Use of 0.5-liter Bottles**
   - **Description:** "When `a` (number of 0.5-liter bottles) is zero or very small, and `c` and `b` are both large, the reliance on 1-liter bottles for precise adjustments without 0.5-liter bottles increases computation time."
   - **Explanation:** This condition underscores the importance of having smaller bottle increments available to quickly reach the exact required cola volume without exhaustive checking of combinations.

By characterizing these conditions, the cause of the slowdown can be linked to the input patterns involving the maximum allowed bottles in certain sizes and the resulting large number of possible combinations that the program must evaluate.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
To celebrate the opening of the Winter Computer School the organizers decided to buy in n liters of cola. However, an unexpected difficulty occurred in the shop: it turned out that cola is sold in bottles 0.5, 1 and 2 liters in volume.

assistant: ### Phase 3: Implementing Performance-Characterizing Invariants as C++ Checkers

Based on the natural language invariants derived earlier, here are the C++ checkers:

1. **Invariant: High Iteration Count in Nested Loops**
   ```cpp
   void check_high_iteration_count_invariant(int b, int c) {
       if (c > 2500 && b > 2500) { // Check for large values that could cause excessive loop iterations
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to high iteration count in nested loops!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Invariant: Excessive Combinations of 1-liter Bottles**
   ```cpp
   void check_excessive_combinations_invariant(int a, int b, int c) {
       if (b > 4500 && a == 0 && c > 2500) { // When 1-liter bottles are high, and no 0.5-liter bottles are available
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to excessive combinations of 1-liter bottles!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Invariant: Minimal Use of 0.5-liter Bottles**
   ```cpp
   void check_minimal_half_liter_bottles_invariant(int a, int b, int c) {
       if (a == 0 && b > 4500 && c > 2500) { // No 0.5-liter bottles with high counts of 1 and 2-liter bottles
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to minimal use of 0.5-liter bottles!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Integrating Checkers into the Original Program

Below is the instrumented C++ program with the checkers integrated:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
const double PI = acos(-1.0);
const double eps = 1e-6;
const int inf = 2147483647;
const int maxn = 10000;
int n, a, b, c;
int ans;

// Checkers for performance bottlenecks
void check_high_iteration_count_invariant(int b, int c) {
    if (c > 2500 && b > 2500) { // Check for large values that could cause excessive loop iterations
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to high iteration count in nested loops!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_excessive_combinations_invariant(int a, int b, int c) {
    if (b > 4500 && a == 0 && c > 2500) { // When 1-liter bottles are high, and no 0.5-liter bottles are available
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to excessive combinations of 1-liter bottles!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_minimal_half_liter_bottles_invariant(int a, int b, int c) {
    if (a == 0 && b > 4500 && c > 2500) { // No 0.5-liter bottles with high counts of 1 and 2-liter bottles
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to minimal use of 0.5-liter bottles!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    scanf("%d%d%d%d", &n, &a, &b, &c);

    // Integrate performance checkers
    check_high_iteration_count_invariant(b, c);
    check_excessive_combinations_invariant(a, b, c);
    check_minimal_half_liter_bottles_invariant(a, b, c);

    int d = a / 2;
    for (int i = 0; i <= c && n - 2 * i >= 0; i++) {
        int res = n - 2 * i;
        if (d + b < res) continue;
        for (int j = 0; j <= b; j++) {
            int rr = res - j;
            if (rr <= d && rr >= 0) ans++;
        }
    }
    printf("%d\n", ans);
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of Inserted Checkers

- **High Iteration Count Checker**: Before entering the loops, we check if both `b` and `c` are large, which can lead to a high iteration count.
- **Excessive Combinations Checker**: Ensures that if `a` is zero, `b` is high, and `c` allows for many combinations, the program detects potential slowdowns.
- **Minimal Half-Liter Bottles Checker**: Checks if zero 0.5-liter bottles combined with high counts of 1 and 2-liter bottles lead to a performance issue.

These checkers help prevent scenarios that can slow down the program significantly by aborting execution when potential performance bottlenecks are detected.
