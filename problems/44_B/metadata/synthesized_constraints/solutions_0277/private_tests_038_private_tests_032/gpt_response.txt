### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Line-Level Hit Count Comparison:**
   - **Line 12:** `for (j = 0; j <= 2 * n; j++)` has 30,006 hits for the slow input and only 36 hits for the fast input.
   - **Line 13:** `for (k = 0; <= b && j + a[i] * k <= 2 * n; k++)` has 75,060,006 hits for the slow input and only 156 hits for the fast input.
   - **Line 14:** `c2[j + a[i] * k] += c1[j];` has 75,030,003 hits for the slow input and only 123 hits for the fast input.

2. **Analysis:**
   - The loop at **Line 12** iterates over a range that is dependent on `2 * n`. For the slow input, `n` is large (5000), leading to a significant number of iterations (twice the size of `n` compared to the fast input).
   - The nested loop at **Line 13** iterates based on the number of available bottles (`b`), and the conditions in this loop also scale with `n`.
   - **Line 14** performs an addition operation inside the innermost loop, leading to a high hit count when both `n` and `b` are large.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **Invariant 1: High Iteration Count Due to Large `n`**
   - **Natural Language Description:**
     - "When `n` is large, the outer loop iterates over a range that scales proportionally with `n`, leading to a vast number of iterations."
   - **Explanation:**
     - The nested loops' iteration count increases dramatically with larger `n`, especially since `n` is doubled in its range (`2 * n`), exacerbating the slowdown.

2. **Invariant 2: Bottleneck in Nested Loops with Large Bottle Counts**
   - **Natural Language Description:**
     - "If the number of available bottles (`a`, `b`, or `c`) is large, the innermost loop is executed many times, causing performance degradation."
   - **Explanation:**
     - When `b` (bottle count) is near its upper threshold and `n` is large, the nested loop structure causes a multiplicative effect, significantly increasing execution time.

3. **Invariant 3: Array Update Overhead in High Iteration Context**
   - **Natural Language Description:**
     - "When the loops are executed many times due to high values of `n` and large bottle counts, frequent updates to arrays (`c1` and `c2`) slow down the program."
   - **Explanation:**
     - The update operations on arrays (`c1` and `c2`) within the innermost loop contribute to computational overhead.

### Summary

These invariants highlight the conditions leading to performance bottlenecks: high values of `n` combined with large available bottle counts (`a`, `b`, or `c`) result in extensive loop iterations and frequent array updates, which degrade the program's execution time.

### Phase 3: Implement the Natural Language Invariants as Checker Code in C++

Based on the performance-characterizing invariants we derived, here is how you can implement the runtime checks in C++:

1. **Invariant 1: High Iteration Count Due to Large `n`**

   ```cpp
   void check_high_iteration_invariant(int n) {
       if (n > 1000) { // Arbitrary threshold based on problem constraints
           std::cerr << "Warning: high_iteration_invariant triggered - n is large, causing many loop iterations" << std::endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Invariant 2: Bottleneck in Nested Loops with Large Bottle Counts**

   ```cpp
   void check_bottleneck_invariant(int b) {
       if (b > 2000) { // Arbitrary threshold considering the maximum of 5000
           std::cerr << "Warning: bottleneck_invariant triggered - large bottle count, causing excessive loop nesting" << std::endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Invariant 3: Array Update Overhead in High Iteration Context**

   ```cpp
   void check_array_update_invariant(int totalIterations) {
       if (totalIterations > 1000000) { // Total iterations measure, considering large enough to be problematic
           std::cerr << "Warning: array_update_invariant triggered - excessive array updates in loops" << std::endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Integrate Checker Code into the Original Program

Here is the original C++ code with the integrated invariant checks:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h> 
using namespace std;

// Function to check for high iteration invariant
void check_high_iteration_invariant(int n) {
    if (n > 1000) { // Arbitrary threshold based on problem constraints
        cerr << "Warning: high_iteration_invariant triggered - n is large, causing many loop iterations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Function to check for bottleneck in nested loops
void check_bottleneck_invariant(int b) {
    if (b > 2000) { // Arbitrary threshold considering the maximum of 5000
        cerr << "Warning: bottleneck_invariant triggered - large bottle count, causing excessive loop nesting" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Function to check for excessive array updates
void check_array_update_invariant(int totalIterations) {
    if (totalIterations > 1000000) { // Total iterations measure
        cerr << "Warning: array_update_invariant triggered - excessive array updates in loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    int n, m, i, j, k, sum;
    int a[5] = {1, 2, 4}, b;
    int c1[20005], c2[20005];

    while (scanf("%d", &n) != EOF) {
        check_high_iteration_invariant(n); // Check for high iteration

        memset(c1, 0, sizeof(c1));
        memset(c2, 0, sizeof(c2));
        c1[0] = 1;

        int totalIterations = 0; // Track total iterations

        for (i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
            scanf("%d", &b);
            check_bottleneck_invariant(b); // Check for bottleneck

            for (j = 0; j <= 2 * n; j++) {
                for (k = 0; k <= b && j + a[i] * k <= 2 * n; k++) {
                    c2[j + a[i] * k] += c1[j];
                    totalIterations++;
                }
            }

            for (j = 0; j <= 2 * n; j++) {
                c1[j] = c2[j];
                c2[j] = 0;
            }
        }

        check_array_update_invariant(totalIterations); // Check for excessive updates
        printf("%d\n", c1[2 * n]);
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of Insertions:

- **`check_high_iteration_invariant(n);`:** Placed immediately after reading `n` to catch high iterations based on `n` before starting the main loop.
  
- **`check_bottleneck_invariant(b);`:** After reading `b`, to ensure large bottle values do not cause excessive nesting.
  
- **`check_array_update_invariant(totalIterations);`:** After all loops, to assess if the total number of array updates exceeds a problematic threshold. 

These checks are placed to effectively capture the conditions causing performance bottlenecks without adding overhead in tight loops.
