=== Invariants Response ===
To diagnose the performance bottleneck in the provided C program, let's conduct a detailed analysis of the hit counts and derive performance-characterizing invariants.

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Loop Hit Counts**:
   - The loops in lines 18-31 are the focus here. Particularly, the loop structures:
     - Lines 19-21 (using two-liter bottles) have significantly higher hit counts in the slow input (`12,507,500` vs. `20` in the fast input).
     - Lines 24-26 (using one-liter bottles) also have very high hit counts for the slow input (`25,010,000` vs. `35`).
     - Lines 29-31 (using half-liter bottles) are hit `37,512,500` times in the slow input compared to `65` in the fast input.

2. **Interaction with Input Variables**:
   - The code multiplies `n` by `2` (line 17), effectively setting the target cola volume in half-liter units.
   - High hit counts suggest that the nested loops iterate extensively over available bottles, which becomes intensive when `n` (double the target volume) is large.
   - The `break` conditions in lines 20, 25, and 30 are critical but not sufficient to prevent excessive iterations when `a`, `b`, or `c` are large.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the hit count analysis and code structure, the following invariants describe the slowdown conditions:

1. **High Target Volume with Large Bottle Counts**:
   - "When `n` is large, particularly close to its upper constraint, and there are large numbers of bottles available (a, b, c), the program enters a slow execution path due to extensive nested loop iterations."

2. **Extensive Combinatorial Exploration**:
   - "The program slows down significantly when it must explore numerous combinations to meet a high target volume using all available bottle sizes, especially when each bottle type count (a, b, c) is high."

3. **Inefficient Break Conditions**:
   - "If the conditions for breaking out of loops depend heavily on the large values of a, b, or c, the recursive nature of accumulation operations causes excessive computational overhead."

### Thresholds and Conditions

Given `n <= 10000` and each bottle count `a, b, c <= 5000`, potential conditions that could be added to catch slow scenarios are:

- **High Volume Condition**: 
  - The slowdown is more likely when `n` approaches 10000, and all bottle counts are non-trivially high (e.g., `a, b, c > 4000`).

- **Loop Iteration Limits**:
  - An insightful check could be to limit the combined iterations across all loops, suggesting thresholds such as:
    - "Check if `n * (a + b + c)` exceeds a certain value, triggering many combinations to be tried."

These invariants aim to capture the essence of the performance bottlenecks observed without relying on specific inputs but instead focusing on the input conditions that lead to slow execution paths.

### Phase 3: Implement Performance-Characterizing Invariants in C++

Based on the natural language invariants derived earlier, we need to implement runtime checks in C++ to identify when the program might encounter performance bottlenecks.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstdlib>

void check_large_n_and_bottles(int n, int a, int b, int c) {
    // Check if n is large and all bottle counts are also large
    if (n > 9000 && a > 4000 && b > 4000 && c > 4000) {
        std::cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large n and bottle counts!" << std::endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_excessive_combination_attempts(int n, int a, int b, int c) {
    // Check if the potential combinations are excessively high
    if (n * (a + b + c) > 50000000) {
        std::cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive combination attempts!" << std::endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrate Checks into the Original Program

Now, let's incorporate these checks into the original C++ code to effectively monitor performance conditions.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
const int INF = (int)2e9;
const double PI = (double)acos(-1.0);
const double EPS = (double)1e-9;
const int MOD = (int)1e9 + 7;
int dat[20005];

void check_large_n_and_bottles(int n, int a, int b, int c) {
    // Check if n is large and all bottle counts are also large
    if (n > 9000 && a > 4000 && b > 4000 && c > 4000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large n and bottle counts!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_excessive_combination_attempts(int n, int a, int b, int c) {
    // Check if the potential combinations are excessively high
    if (n * (a + b + c) > 50000000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive combination attempts!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    // Initialize data array
    for (int i = 0; i <= 20003 - 1; i += 1) dat[i] = 0;
    dat[0] = 1;

    int n, a, b, c;
    scanf("%d %d %d %d", &n, &a, &b, &c);

    // Check for performance bottlenecks
    check_large_n_and_bottles(n, a, b, c);
    check_excessive_combination_attempts(n, a, b, c);

    // Adjust n to consider half-liter units
    n *= 2;

    // Calculate number of ways to purchase exactly n liters of cola
    for (int i = n; i >= 1; i -= 1)
        for (int j = 1; j <= c; j += 1) {
            if (i - (j << 2) < 0) break;
            dat[i] += dat[i - (j << 2)];
        }
    for (int i = n; i >= 1; i -= 1)
        for (int j = 1; j <= b; j += 1) {
            if (i - (j << 1) < 0) break;
            dat[i] += dat[i - (j << 1)];
        }
    for (int i = n; i >= 1; i -= 1)
        for (int j = 1; j <= a; j += 1) {
            if (i - (j << 0) < 0) break;
            dat[i] += dat[i - (j << 0)];
        }

    printf("%d\n", dat[n]);
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

- **Check Insertion Points**: The checks are inserted right after input reading and before starting the computationally intensive loops, ensuring they don't add significant overhead to the loop execution.
- **Checker Functions**: Two separate functions, `check_large_n_and_bottles` and `check_excessive_combination_attempts`, were added to encapsulate the logic for detecting potential performance bottlenecks. Each function outputs a warning and aborts execution if a bottleneck condition is met. 
- **Thresholds**: The thresholds are chosen based on the derived invariants, aiming to detect performance issues as `n`, `a`, `b`, `c` approach their higher limits within the provided constraints.
