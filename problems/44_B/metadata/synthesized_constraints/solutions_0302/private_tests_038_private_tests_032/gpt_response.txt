### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

Upon reviewing the line-level hit counts for both the "fast" and "slow" inputs, the following observations can be made:

1. **Initialization Loop**:
   - Line 9 (`for (i = 0; i <= n; i++)`): Hit count is significantly higher for the slow input (10,002 vs. 12). This suggests that the array `dp` is initialized to zero over a much larger range for the slow input.

2. **Nested Loops**:
   - Line 20 (`for (j = n; j >= 0; j--)`): This loop is run 30,006 times for the slow input compared to 36 times for the fast input.
   - Line 22 (`for (k = 1; k <= cnt[i]; k++)`): This loop has a massive hit count difference (31,270,003 vs. 68), indicating a significant nested loop interaction due to large values in `cnt[]`.

3. **Inner Condition and Update**:
   - Line 23 (`if (j + k * v > n) break;`): This line is hit almost as often as the loop on line 22, indicating frequent evaluations of the condition.
   - Line 24 (`dp[j + k * v] = dp[j + k * v] + dp[j];`): This line is executed a substantial number of times (31,255,000 vs. 45), showing a heavy computational load.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the analysis, several conditions can be identified where the code is likely to run slowly:

1. **High Initial Setup Cost**:
   - **Invariant**: "When `n` is large, the initialization of the `dp` array takes considerable time, leading to potential slowdowns."
     - This is due to the line `for (i = 0; i <= n; i++)` which initializes `dp` over a range proportional to `n`.

2. **High Complexity in Nested Loops**:
   - **Invariant**: "The performance degrades when the sum of `cnt` values leads to a large number of iterations in nested loops, particularly when `cnt[]` contains large numbers."
     - This indicates the presence of a high number of combinations being processed, as illustrated by the nested loops iterating over potential bottle combinations based on available quantities.

3. **Frequent Value Updates**:
   - **Invariant**: "The computation becomes intensive when the sum of volumes (`0.5 * a + b + 2 * c`) approaches `n`, as it causes frequent updates in the state array."
     - This suggests that when the available volumes nearly match `n`, many combinations are possible, leading to extensive updates in `dp`.

4. **Exceeding Capacity**:
   - **Invariant**: "When `j + k * v` frequently approaches `n`, the performance can degrade due to repeated evaluations and updates."
     - This points to the inefficiency induced by constantly reaching the condition boundary, causing frequent loop iterations and checks.

### Conclusion

The primary bottlenecks arise from the initialization of the `dp` array and the extensive nested loops, which are exacerbated by large values in `cnt[]`. These lead to numerous combinations being checked and updated, causing significant slowdowns.

### Phase 3: Implement the Natural Language Invariants in C++

Here we will create C++ code snippets for each invariant identified in Phase 2:

1. **High Initial Setup Cost**:
   ```cpp
   void check_initialization_invariant(int n) {
       if (n > 5000) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large initialization range!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **High Complexity in Nested Loops**:
   ```cpp
   void check_nested_loops_invariant(int cnt0, int cnt1, int cnt2) {
       if (cnt0 + cnt1 + cnt2 > 10000) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive loop iterations!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Frequent Value Updates**:
   ```cpp
   void check_update_invariant(int n, int a, int b, int c) {
       if (0.5 * a + b + 2 * c >= n) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - frequent updates!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

4. **Exceeding Capacity**:
   ```cpp
   void check_capacity_invariant(int n, int v, int cnti) {
       if (n < v * cnti) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - capacity exceeded!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Integrate Checkers into the C++ Code

We will now integrate the above checkers into the provided C++ code. These checks will be strategically placed to ensure minimal overhead:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>

int dp[20005];
int n;
int cnt[3];

void check_initialization_invariant(int n) {
    if (n > 5000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large initialization range!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_nested_loops_invariant(int cnt0, int cnt1, int cnt2) {
    if (cnt0 + cnt1 + cnt2 > 10000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive loop iterations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_update_invariant(int n, int a, int b, int c) {
    if (0.5 * a + b + 2 * c >= n) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - frequent updates!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_capacity_invariant(int n, int v, int cnti) {
    if (n < v * cnti) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - capacity exceeded!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    int i, j, a, b, c, v, k;
    scanf("%d%d%d%d", &n, &cnt[0], &cnt[1], &cnt[2]);

    // Convert n from liters to half-liters and check initialization conditions
    n = n * 2;
    check_initialization_invariant(n);

    // Check conditions for nested loops and value updates
    check_nested_loops_invariant(cnt[0], cnt[1], cnt[2]);
    check_update_invariant(n, cnt[0], cnt[1], cnt[2]);

    for (i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
        dp[i] = 0;
    }
    dp[0] = 1;

    for (i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
        if (i == 0)
            v = 1;
        else if (i == 1)
            v = 2;
        else
            v = 4;

        // Check capacity invariant for each different type of bottle size
        check_capacity_invariant(n, v, cnt[i]);

        for (j = n; j >= 0; j--) {
            if (dp[j] != 0) {
                for (k = 1; k <= cnt[i]; k++) {
                    if (j + k * v > n) break;
                    dp[j + k * v] = dp[j + k * v] + dp[j];
                }
            }
        }
    }
    printf("%d\n", dp[n]);
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

- The checkers are implemented as functions that are called before the loops to detect potential bottlenecks early.
- Each checker prints a warning and aborts execution if a condition indicative of a performance bottleneck is met.
- These checks are designed to avoid entering potentially inefficient computation patterns, aiding in detecting problematic inputs during testing or fuzzing.
