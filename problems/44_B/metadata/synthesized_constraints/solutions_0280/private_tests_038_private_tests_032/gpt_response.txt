### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

Upon analyzing the hit counts between the fast and slow inputs:

1. **Line 12:** The `for` loop iterating over `s` hits significantly more often with the slow input (30,006 times vs. 36 times).
2. **Line 13:** The nested `for` loop iterating over `i` is extremely hit with the slow input (75,060,006 times vs. 156 times). This indicates a key inefficiency.
3. **Line 14 and 15:** These lines are involved in checking and updating the dynamic programming table and are hit almost as frequently as the loop iterating over `i`, showing they contribute to the expensive operations, particularly for the slow input.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the analysis, the following performance-characterizing invariants can be derived:

1. **High Sum Scenarios:**
   - **Natural Language Statement:** "When the required volume of cola (`n`) multiplied by two due to conversion into half-liter units is close to the maximum constraint of 20,000, the loops iterate over large ranges, causing significant performance degradation."
   - **Explanation:** The doubling of `n` (via `sum <<= 1`) for handling half-liter units makes the effective problem size much larger. This increased range causes the inner loops to execute far more times, especially when `n` itself is large.

2. **Large Maximum Bottles Available:**
   - **Natural Language Statement:** "If the number of available bottles of any kind (`a`, `b`, `c`) is close to their maximum constraint (5,000), the program iterates excessively over possible configurations, significantly slowing down the execution."
   - **Explanation:** The loop over `i` reaches up to `a[n] + 1`, meaning that with `a`, `b`, or `c` being large, the loop has a vast range to iterate through, particularly impacting performance when combined with a high `sum`.

3. **Complexity from Combinatorial Explosion:**
   - **Natural Language Statement:** "The combinatorial nature of the dynamic programming approach can cause a slowdown when both the sum of liters (doubled) and available bottles are large, as this leads to excessive checks and updates within the nested loops."
   - **Explanation:** The dynamic programming table updates (line 15) become a bottleneck due to the dense matrix-like operations induced by the double loop structure, particularly exacerbated when potential combinations are numerous due to high `n`, `a`, `b`, or `c`.

These invariants point to specific scenarios where the dynamic programming approach becomes inefficient, primarily due to excessively large input parameters that push the algorithm into a slow execution path. Adopting these insights can help optimize the algorithm or preemptively identify slow execution scenarios during testing and development.

### Phase 3: Implementing the Natural Language Invariants in C++

Below are the C++ code snippets to implement the performance-characterizing invariants derived previously:

```cpp
void check_high_sum_invariant(int sum) {
    if (sum > 19900) { // Checking if doubled `n` is close to max constraint
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - Sum too high!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_large_bottle_invariant(int a, int b, int c) {
    if (a > 4500 || b > 4500 || c > 4500) { // Checking if bottle counts are close to their max constraint
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - Large number of available bottles!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_combinatorial_explosion_invariant(int sum, int a, int b, int c) {
    if (sum > 19000 && (a > 4000 || b > 4000 || c > 4000)) {
        // This checks a combination where both `sum` and available bottles are large
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - Combinatorial explosion potential!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrating the Checker C++ Code with the Original Program

The following C++ code integrates the checkers into the original program. Each check is placed after reading inputs and before entering the main computational loop to avoid adding overhead in tight loops:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>

// Checker functions
void check_high_sum_invariant(int sum) {
    if (sum > 19900) { // Checking if doubled `n` is close to max constraint
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - Sum too high!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_large_bottle_invariant(int a, int b, int c) {
    if (a > 4500 || b > 4500 || c > 4500) { // Checking if bottle counts are close to their max constraint
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - Large number of available bottles!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_combinatorial_explosion_invariant(int sum, int a, int b, int c) {
    if (sum > 19000 && (a > 4000 || b > 4000 || c > 4000)) {
        // This checks a combination where both `sum` and available bottles are large
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - Combinatorial explosion potential!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int dp[20001][4];
int a[3];
int main() {
    int N, sum;
    scanf("%d %d %d %d", &sum, &a[0], &a[1], &a[2]);
    
    // Apply the performance checks before processing
    sum <<= 1;
    check_high_sum_invariant(sum);
    check_large_bottle_invariant(a[0], a[1], a[2]);
    check_combinatorial_explosion_invariant(sum, a[0], a[1], a[2]);

    N = 3;
    memset(dp, 0, sizeof dp);
    dp[0][0] = 1;
    for (int n = 0; n < N; ++n) {
        for (int s = 0; s < sum + 1; ++s) {
            for (int i = 0; i < a[n] + 1; ++i) {
                if (s < (1 << n) * i) break;
                dp[s][n + 1] += dp[s - (1 << n) * i][n];
            }
        }
    }
    printf("%d\n", dp[sum][N]);
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

- **Checker Insertion:** Checkers are inserted immediately after input reading, ensuring they do not affect performance during the main processing loops. This placement is crucial to identify potential bottlenecks without adding unnecessary computational overhead.
- **Threshold Values:** The chosen threshold values reflect the constraints and scenario from the problem statement, ensuring that the checks are realistic and aligned with potential bottlenecks identified during analysis.
