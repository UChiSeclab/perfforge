=== Invariants Response ===
To analyze and derive performance-characterizing invariants for the given C code and problem statement, we need to follow the two-phase approach: 

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Line-Level Hit Count Analysis:**
   - The loop from lines 8-9 shows significant hit counts for both slow and fast inputs, specifically `5002` for the slow input and `7` for the fast input.
   - The nested loop on lines 12-14 experiences a massive difference, with the slow input hitting `6,260,002` times versus `18` times for the fast input.
   - The loop on lines 18-20 is also hit `5002` times for the slow input compared to `7` for the fast input.

2. **Code Inference:**
   - The main contributors to the slowdown are the nested loops on lines 12-14, where line 13 (`for (int j = 0; j <= c && i + j * 2 <= n; j++)`) gets hit very frequently. This suggests that the loop's complexity is heavily influenced by the values of `b`, `c`, and `n`.
   - The condition in this nested loop checks combinations of `0.5L` and `2L` bottles to meet the exact requirement, which implies that a large value of `c` combined with large `n` results in a large number of iterations.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the analysis, here are the invariants in natural language:

1. **Invariant 1: High Bottleneck from Large `c` and `n` Values**
   - **Natural Language Description:** When both `c` (number of 2L bottles) and `n` (required liters) are large, the nested loop iterates extensively, leading to slow execution.
   - **Reasoning:** The loop on line 13 is tasked with exploring combinations of `2L` bottle usage. The more `c` and `n` increase, the more combinations must be checked, especially near the upper bounds, causing higher iteration counts.

2. **Invariant 2: Exhaustive Combinations Cause Slowdown**
   - **Natural Language Description:** If the values of `b` and `c` (number of 1L and 2L bottles) together allow for many combinations that still require checking against the target `n`, the code enters a slow path due to excessive loop executions.
   - **Reasoning:** The setup in the nested loops requires checking many combinations of remaining volumes, which can exponentially increase with higher values of `b` and `c`.

3. **Invariant 3: Extensive State Space in DP Array**
   - **Natural Language Description:** When `b` and `c` are both high, the state-space explored by the dynamic programming arrays `f` and `g` increases significantly, slowing the computation.
   - **Reasoning:** The arrays `f` and `g` are used to store possible solutions incrementally. High values of `b` and `c` mean more states to track, resulting in slower operations as arrays need updating for each valid combination.

These invariants help capture scenarios leading to slow performance without relying on specific input values, remaining within the problem constraints. They provide a generalized understanding of potential bottlenecks in the code execution.

### Phase 3: Implement the Natural Language Invariants in C++ Checkers

Let's translate the previously derived performance-characterizing invariants into C++ code snippets:

1. **Invariant 1: High Bottleneck from Large `c` and `n` Values**

```cpp
void check_large_c_and_n(int n, int c) {
    if (n > 8000 && c > 4000) { // Arbitrary threshold chosen based on problem constraints
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to large c and n values!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

2. **Invariant 2: Exhaustive Combinations Cause Slowdown**

```cpp
void check_exhaustive_combinations(int b, int c, int n) {
    if (b > 4000 && c > 4000 && n > 8000) { // Arbitrary threshold based on problem constraints
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to exhaustive combinations of b and c!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

3. **Invariant 3: Extensive State Space in DP Array**

```cpp
void check_large_state_space(int b, int c) {
    if (b + c > 8000) { // Arbitrary threshold based on problem constraints
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to extensive state space in DP!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrate Checkers into the Original Program

Now let's integrate these checkers into the original C++ program without adding overhead in tight loops:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
const int MAXN = 11000;
long long f[MAXN], g[MAXN];

void check_large_c_and_n(int n, int c) {
    if (n > 8000 && c > 4000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to large c and n values!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_exhaustive_combinations(int b, int c, int n) {
    if (b > 4000 && c > 4000 && n > 8000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to exhaustive combinations of b and c!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_large_state_space(int b, int c) {
    if (b + c > 8000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to extensive state space in DP!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    int n, a, b, c;
    scanf("%d%d%d%d", &n, &a, &b, &c);

    // Check performance-characterizing invariants after input
    check_large_c_and_n(n, c);
    check_exhaustive_combinations(b, c, n);
    check_large_state_space(b, c);

    memset(f, 0, sizeof(f));
    for (int i = 0; i <= b && i <= n; i++) {
        f[i] = 1;
    }
    memset(g, 0, sizeof(g));
    for (int i = 0; i <= b && i <= n; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j <= c && i + j * 2 <= n; j++) {
            g[i + j * 2] += f[i];
        }
    }
    long long res = 0LL;
    for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
        if ((n - i) * 2 <= a) {
            res += g[i];
        }
    }
    printf("%lld\n", res);
    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation of Checker Integration:**
- The checks are inserted right after reading the inputs (`n`, `a`, `b`, `c`), as this is where we can effectively determine whether any invariant conditions are met.
- This placement avoids adding overhead to the loops by preventing checks from being evaluated repeatedly during intensive operations like the nested loops. 
- The chosen thresholds are within the problem constraints and aim to capture potential performance bottlenecks effectively.
