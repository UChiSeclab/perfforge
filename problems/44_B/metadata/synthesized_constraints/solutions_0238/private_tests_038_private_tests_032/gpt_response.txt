=== Invariants Response ===
### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Line-level Hit Count Analysis:**
   - **Line 10:** The loop `for (k = n; k >= 0; k--)` is executed significantly more times in the slow input (30,006 hits) than in the fast input (36 hits).
   - **Line 11:** The nested loop `for (j = 0; j * b[i] <= k && j <= a[i]; j++)` is executed an exceptionally high number of times for the slow input (75,060,006 hits) compared to the fast input (156 hits).
   - **Line 12:** The operation `f[i][k] += f[i - 1][k - j * b[i]];` within the nested loop is also a major hotspot (75,030,003 hits for slow input versus 123 for fast).

2. **Interaction with Data Structures and Loops:**
   - The combination of the loops on `i`, `k`, and `j` create a potential for a massive number of operations when `n` is large or when the constraints on bottle counts (`a[i]`) allow for many iterations of `j`.
   - This combination leads to a high frequency of updates to the `f` array, especially when `k` is large, which suggests that the algorithm's complexity is driven by the size of `n` and the availability of bottles.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **Invariant on Large `n`:**
   - **Natural Language Description:** When `n` is large, the number of iterations in the loops increases significantly, which can lead to a slowdown. The program's performance degrades as `n` approaches its upper limit because the combination of possible bottle combinations and the nested iteration over `k` results in a large number of calculations.
   - **Condition Example:** "If `n` is close to 10,000, the loops perform significantly more operations leading to potential slowdowns."

2. **Invariant on Maximum Capacity of Bottles:**
   - **Natural Language Description:** If each type of bottle (`a`, `b`, `c`) is available in large quantities, the inner loop designated by `j` can iterate over many possible combinations, significantly increasing the computational overhead.
   - **Condition Example:** "If the quantities `a`, `b`, and `c` are large enough to allow numerous valid combinations (e.g., close to 5,000 for each type), the system becomes burdened with excessive computation."

3. **Invariant on Nested Loop Complexity:**
   - **Natural Language Description:** The nested loop structure is sensitive to the product of `n` and maximum possible combinations of bottles. A combination of large `n` and maximum bottle availability hugely increases the complexity.
   - **Condition Example:** "High complexity arises when both `n` is large and the constraints `a`, `b`, `c` allow for many iterations, resulting in a combinatorial explosion of possibilities."

### Summary of Performance Triggers

- The program slows down significantly when `n` is large, particularly when it approaches the maximum constraint of 10,000.
- The availability of bottles (`a`, `b`, `c`) in large numbers increases the computational burden as it expands the solution space excessively.
- The interaction of the nested loops with large `n` and high availability of bottles leads to an exponential increase in processing operations, causing performance degradation.

These performance-characterizing invariants help in identifying scenarios under which the algorithm may underperform, providing a basis for optimization or refactoring efforts to avoid combinatorial explosion in the presence of large input values.

=== Checker Response ===
### Phase 3: Implement the Natural Language Invariants in C++

To address the identified performance issues, we'll create checker functions based on the natural language invariants derived earlier. These checkers will monitor conditions that can lead to performance bottlenecks.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstdlib>

void check_n_invariant(long n) {
    if (n > 9000) {  // Arbitrary threshold based on problem constraints
        std::cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large n value." << std::endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_bottle_availability_invariant(long a, long b, long c) {
    if (a > 4500 && b > 4500 && c > 4500) {  // High availability of bottles
        std::cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high bottle availability." << std::endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_combination_complexity_invariant(long n, long a, long b, long c) {
    if ((n > 9000) && (a > 4500 || b > 4500 || c > 4500)) {
        std::cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large n with high bottle availability." << std::endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrate Checker Code into the Original Program

Now we will integrate these checks into the provided C++ code. The checks will be placed strategically to trigger before the main computational loops begin.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>

// Checker functions to identify potential performance bottlenecks
void check_n_invariant(long n) {
    if (n > 9000) {
        std::cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large n value." << std::endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_bottle_availability_invariant(long a, long b, long c) {
    if (a > 4500 && b > 4500 && c > 4500) {
        std::cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high bottle availability." << std::endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_combination_complexity_invariant(long n, long a, long b, long c) {
    if ((n > 9000) && (a > 4500 || b > 4500 || c > 4500)) {
        std::cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large n with high bottle availability." << std::endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    long n;
    long long f[4][20005] = {0}, a[4] = {0}, b[4] = {0, 1, 2, 4};
    long i, j, k;
    scanf("%I64d%I64d%I64d%I64d", &n, &a[1], &a[2], &a[3]);
  
    // Insert checker functions after input is read
    check_n_invariant(n);
    check_bottle_availability_invariant(a[1], a[2], a[3]);
    check_combination_complexity_invariant(n, a[1], a[2], a[3]);

    n = n * 2;
    f[0][0] = 1;
    
    for (i = 1; i <= 3; i++) {
        for (k = n; k >= 0; k--) {
            for (j = 0; j * b[i] <= k && j <= a[i]; j++) {
                f[i][k] += f[i - 1][k - j * b[i]];
            }
        }
    }
    
    printf("%I64d\n", f[3][n]);
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

- **`check_n_invariant(long n)`**: Ensures `n` does not exceed a threshold (9000) to prevent slowdowns associated with large `n`.
- **`check_bottle_availability_invariant(long a, long b, long c)`**: Checks if all bottle types are available in high quantities, which can lead to a combinatorial explosion.
- **`check_combination_complexity_invariant(long n, long a, long b, long c)`**: Combines the effects of a large `n` and high availability of bottles, which together can severely degrade performance.

These checks are strategically placed after input parsing to ensure they are checked once before entering the main computational logic, avoiding unnecessary overhead inside performance-critical loops.
