### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

**Analysis of Line-Level Hit Counts:**

1. **Function `cr` (Lines 3-9):**
   - The function `cr` is called significantly more often with the slow input (`2997` hits) compared to the fast input (`3` hits). 
   - The inner loop on line 5 is executed `1998999` times for the slow input, indicating it’s a major contributor to the slowdown.

2. **Main Function (Lines 10-23):**
   - The loop on line 15 iterates `1000` times for the slow input. Within this loop, the `cr` function is called multiple times (lines 16-17), suggesting nested calls that increase exponentially with larger inputs.
   - The hit count for the expression in lines 16-18 indicates repeated computation, which may become computationally expensive with larger values of `n` and `m`.

**Interactions with Data Structures:**

- The slow input has `n=999` and `m=999`, resulting in high-loop iterations and multiple recursive/exponential computations in the `cr` function.
- The problem's constraints (with the maximum `n` and `m` up to `1000`) mean that this slow input approaches the upper bounds, triggering deeply nested loops and recursive function calls.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Here are the natural language performance invariants that describe the conditions under which the program slows down:

1. **High Iteration Count in Nested Loops:**
   - "When the values of `n` and `m` are both very large, close to the constraint limit (e.g., `n` and `m` near 1000), the program significantly slows down due to high iteration counts within nested loops, leading to excessive repeated computations."

2. **Exponential Growth due to Nested Function Calls:**
   - "If both `n` and `m` are large, the recursive nature of the `cr` function, invoked within nested loops, causes the computations to grow exponentially, resulting in substantial performance degradation."

3. **Inefficient Logarithmic Calculations:**
   - "The repeated calculation of logarithmic expressions in nested loops, especially when the loop variable is large, can lead to performance issues due to the computational cost of logarithmic operations at scale."

4. **Complexity of Combining Inputs in Computation:**
   - "The complexity of computing probabilities based on large values of `n` and `m` (close to their maximum constraints) results in an increased number of operations, making the overall execution time notably longer."

These invariants are designed to capture broad conditions that induce slow performance, aligning with input constraint limits (up to `n, m ≤ 1000`), without relying on specific numeric values. They consider the potential for nested loops and recursive functions to exacerbate computation time when input values are high.

### Phase 3: Implement the Natural Language Invariants in C++

For each invariant derived earlier, we will implement a corresponding runtime check in C++.

#### Invariant 1: High Iteration Count in Nested Loops

```cpp
void check_high_iteration_invariant(int n, int m) {
    if (n > 900 && m > 900) { // Assuming thresholds near the constraint limits.
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high iteration count in nested loops!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

#### Invariant 2: Exponential Growth due to Nested Function Calls

```cpp
void check_exponential_growth_invariant(int n, int m) {
    if (n > 900 && m > 900) { // Similar threshold as exponential growth is linked with high input values.
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - exponential growth due to nested function calls!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

#### Invariant 3: Inefficient Logarithmic Calculations

```cpp
void check_logarithmic_calculation_invariant(int n, int m) {
    if (n > 900 && m > 900) { // Thresholds chosen to reflect computational intensity at high values.
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - inefficient logarithmic calculations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

#### Invariant 4: Complexity of Combining Inputs in Computation

```cpp
void check_combination_complexity_invariant(int n, int m) {
    if (n > 900 && m > 900) { // Larger values result in more complex computations.
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - complexity in combining inputs for computation!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrate the Checker Code with the Original Program

Now we will integrate these checks into the original C++ program. We will place these checks after reading the input values to avoid adding overhead within tight loops.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Checker functions for performance bottlenecks
void check_high_iteration_invariant(int n, int m) {
    if (n > 900 && m > 900) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high iteration count in nested loops!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_exponential_growth_invariant(int n, int m) {
    if (n > 900 && m > 900) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - exponential growth due to nested function calls!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_logarithmic_calculation_invariant(int n, int m) {
    if (n > 900 && m > 900) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - inefficient logarithmic calculations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_combination_complexity_invariant(int n, int m) {
    if (n > 900 && m > 900) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - complexity in combining inputs for computation!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Original solution code
double cr(int n, int m) {
    double res = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i < m + 1; i++) {
        res += -log(i) + log(n - i + 1);
    }
    return res;
}

int main() {
    int n, m;
    while (cin >> n >> m) {

        // Insert checker functions after reading inputs
        check_high_iteration_invariant(n, m);
        check_exponential_growth_invariant(n, m);
        check_logarithmic_calculation_invariant(n, m);
        check_combination_complexity_invariant(n, m);

        int mi = min(n, m);
        double ans = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < mi + 1; i++) {
            double tem = 2 * (log(i) - log(n)) + log(n) + cr(m, i) +
                         cr((n - 1) * m, n - i) - cr(n * m, n);
            ans += exp(tem);
        }
        printf("%.9f\n", ans);
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

- **Checker Functions:** Each invariant is translated into a function that checks the conditions derived in the previous phase. The thresholds reflect points at which performance is observed to degrade significantly.
- **Integration:** The checkers are placed right after reading input values, ensuring they are evaluated once per input set, avoiding additional overhead in the main computational loops.
