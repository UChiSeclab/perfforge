### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Comparing Line-Level Hit Counts:**
   - The function `pr()` (line 3) is called 2112 times with the slow input, compared to just 1 time with the fast input.
   - The loops inside `pr()` (lines 5, 6, and 7) exhibit a significant increase in hit counts with the slow input. Specifically, line 5 and 7 each have over 2 million hits, indicating they are executed frequently.

2. **Pinpointing Lines with More Hits:**
   - **Line 5:** This loop runs `a` times, where `a` is presumably large given the slow input. The large hit count indicates that this loop is a bottleneck.
   - **Line 7:** This loop also runs `a` times, compounding the performance issue.
   - **Line 17:** The loop iterating over `i` in the main function also runs a large number of times, 2112 times for the slow input, indicating a correlation with the value of `m`.

3. **Interaction with Data Structures and Loops:**
   - The loops in `pr()` are nested and depend on the parameters `a`, `n`, and `m`. Given that `n` and `m` can go up to 1000, these loops can perform a substantial number of iterations, especially when `a` approaches `m`.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the analysis, the following performance-characterizing invariants can be derived:

1. **High Loop Iteration:**
   - **Natural Language Invariant:** "If the number of decks `m` is large, the function `pr()` is called repeatedly, and the inner loops execute a large number of iterations. This is especially true when `a` is close to `m`, causing these nested loops to become performance bottlenecks."
   - **Abstract Condition:** The loop in `pr()` and the main function should be optimized when the range of `i` in `main()` and `a` in `pr()` approach the upper limits defined by `m` and `n`.

2. **Expensive Calculations in Loops:**
   - **Natural Language Invariant:** "When the main loop runs for each value of `i` from 1 to `m`, and within `pr()`, the nested loop computations (involving division and multiplication) become computationally expensive, especially if `m` is large."
   - **Abstract Condition:** Consider computational overhead when `m` is large, requiring potential optimization or approximation in calculations if `m` approaches 1000.

3. **Function Call Overhead:**
   - **Natural Language Invariant:** "The repeated invocation of the function `pr()` with large values of `m` leads to significant computation time spent in recalculating similar values."
   - **Abstract Condition:** Optimize function calls or memoize results if the inputs remain consistent across multiple invocations, especially as `m` approaches its maximum constraint.

These statements characterize conditions that lead to performance degradation, focusing on loop iterations and function call overhead, which are significant when `m` is large. They abstract the problem of high iteration costs without relying on explicit input values.

### Phase 3: Implementing Natural Language Invariants in C++

Based on the performance-characterizing invariants derived in natural language, here are the corresponding C++ checker implementations:

1. **High Loop Iteration Checker:**

   ```cpp
   void check_high_loop_iteration_invariant(double m) {
       if (m > 900) { // Threshold chosen as a heuristic when m is large.
           cerr << "Warning: High loop iteration invariant triggered - m is large, causing extensive loop iterations." << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Expensive Calculations in Loops Checker:**

   ```cpp
   void check_expensive_calculations_invariant(double n, double m) {
       if (m * n > 950000) { // Condition indicating potentially expensive calculations.
           cerr << "Warning: Expensive calculations invariant triggered - m and n combination may lead to heavy computation." << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Function Call Overhead Checker:**

   ```cpp
   void check_function_call_overhead_invariant(double a, double m) {
       if (a > m * 0.9) { // If a approaches m, indicating repeated computation.
           cerr << "Warning: Function call overhead invariant triggered - repeated calls with large parameters." << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Integrating Checks into the Original Program

Now, let's integrate these checks into the given C++ program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Checker functions
void check_high_loop_iteration_invariant(double m) {
    if (m > 900) { // Threshold chosen as a heuristic when m is large.
        cerr << "Warning: High loop iteration invariant triggered - m is large, causing extensive loop iterations." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_expensive_calculations_invariant(double n, double m) {
    if (m * n > 950000) { // Condition indicating potentially expensive calculations.
        cerr << "Warning: Expensive calculations invariant triggered - m and n combination may lead to heavy computation." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_function_call_overhead_invariant(double a, double m) {
    if (a > m * 0.9) { // If a approaches m, indicating repeated computation.
        cerr << "Warning: Function call overhead invariant triggered - repeated calls with large parameters." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Probability calculation function
double pr(double a, double n, double m) {
    check_function_call_overhead_invariant(a, m); // Insert check before loop processing
    double u = 1.0;
    for (int i = 0; i < a; i++) u *= (m - i) / (m * n - i);
    for (int i = 0; i < n - a; i++) u *= (m * n - m - i) / (m * n - a - i);
    for (int i = 0; i < a; i++) {
        u *= (n - i) / (a - i);
    }
    return u;
}

int main() {
    double n;
    double m;
    cin >> n >> m;

    // Insert checks after input and before main computation
    check_high_loop_iteration_invariant(m);
    check_expensive_calculations_invariant(n, m);

    double p = 0;
    for (double i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
        p += i * i / n * pr(i, n, m);
    }
    cout << p;
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

- **High Loop Iteration Checker:** Added after reading `m` to ensure we catch large values causing extensive iterations.
- **Expensive Calculations Checker:** Placed after input to detect combinations of `n` and `m` that could lead to heavy computation.
- **Function Call Overhead Checker:** Added at the start of the `pr()` function to prevent unnecessary repeated calculations when `a` is close to `m`.

These checks are intended to help detect conditions leading to performance bottlenecks, ensuring they trigger warnings when problematic inputs occur.
