system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

Alex enjoys performing magic tricks. He has a trick that requires a deck of n cards. He has m identical decks of n different cards each, which have been mixed together. When Alex wishes to perform the trick, he grabs n cards at random and performs the trick with those. The resulting deck looks like a normal deck, but may have duplicates of some cards.

The trick itself is performed as follows: first Alex allows you to choose a random card from the deck. You memorize the card and put it back in the deck. Then Alex shuffles the deck, and pulls out a card. If the card matches the one you memorized, the trick is successful.

You don't think Alex is a very good magician, and that he just pulls a card randomly from the deck. Determine the probability of the trick being successful if this is the case.

Input

First line of the input consists of two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000), separated by space — number of cards in each deck, and number of decks.

Output

On the only line of the output print one floating point number – probability of Alex successfully performing the trick. Relative or absolute error of your answer should not be higher than 10 - 6.

4 4


Output

0.4000000000000000

1.0000000000000000

Note

In the first sample, with probability <image> Alex will perform the trick with two cards with the same value from two different decks. In this case the trick is guaranteed to succeed.

With the remaining <image> probability he took two different cards, and the probability of pulling off the trick is <image>.

The resulting probability is <image>

assistant: To diagnose the performance issues in the given C program, let's perform a detailed analysis based on the provided hit count information and derive performance-characterizing invariants.

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Line-Level Hit Count Comparison**:
   - The function `p(int k)` is called significantly more times for the slow input, with the loop in `main()` iterating 999 times compared to just once for the fast input.
   - Lines inside `p(int k)` that handle vector operations, such as loops that populate vectors `A` and `B`, are hit very frequently for the slow input. For instance, lines 6, 11, 16, 21, and 26 are involved in filling the vectors and are hit hundreds of thousands of times.
   - Sorting operations on large vectors on lines 31 and 32 also contribute to the inefficiency, though their impact is less pronounced compared to the vector-filling loops.

2. **Potential Causes of Slowdown**:
   - The loops for populating vectors `A` and `B` are executed a large number of times due to the iterative process over `k` values and the size of `n` and `m`. With large `n` (999) and `m` (999), the vectors become large, and operations on these vectors (insertion, sorting) are time-consuming.
   - The nested loop structure and the operations performed for each `k` result in a quadratic time complexity with respect to `n` and `m`, which is exacerbated by the large loop bounds and vector sizes.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the identified inefficiencies, we can derive the following performance-characterizing invariants in natural language:

1. **Large Vector Operations**:
   - Natural Language Description: "If both `n` and `m` are large, leading to vectors `A` and `B` that grow proportionally, and are filled and sorted repeatedly, this can slow down the program significantly."
   - This invariant captures the high operation count from filling and sorting large vectors when `n` and `m` approach their upper limits.

2. **Iterative Overhead**:
   - Natural Language Description: "When the loop iterates for a large number of `k` values, combined with high values of `n` and `m`, the accumulation of vector operations induces a substantial computational load, causing performance degradation."
   - This invariant highlights the effect of the iterative process and the role of `k` in exacerbating the number of operations.

3. **Quadratic Complexity in Vector Operations**:
   - Natural Language Description: "The quadratic growth in operations due to vector population and sorting can lead to performance issues when `k`, `n`, and `m` are all near their maximum, as this results in a high number of arithmetic operations across large data sets."
   - This invariant points out the combined effect of large input size and iterative complexity.

### Summary

The identified invariants focus on the interaction between input size, loop iterations, and vector operations that together cause significant slowdowns. By understanding these patterns, developers can target optimizations, like reducing unnecessary operations or rethinking the algorithm to handle large inputs more efficiently.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
Alex enjoys performing magic tricks. He has a trick that requires a deck of n cards. He has m identical decks of n different cards each, which have been mixed together. When Alex wishes to perform the trick, he grabs n cards at random and performs the trick with those. The resulting deck looks like a normal deck, but may have duplicates of some cards.

The trick itself is performed as follows: first Alex allows you to choose a random card from the deck. You memorize the card and put it back in the deck. Then Alex shuffles the deck, and pulls out a card. If the card matches the one you memorized, the trick is successful.

You don't think Alex is a very good magician, and that he just pulls a card randomly from the deck. Determine the probability of the trick being successful if this is the case.

Input

First line of the input consists of two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000), separated by space — number of cards in each deck, and number of decks.

Output

On the only line of the output print one floating point number – probability of Alex successfully performing the trick. Relative or absolute error of your answer should not be higher than 10 - 6.

Examples

Input

2 2


Output

0.6666666666666666


Input

4 4


Output

0.4000000000000000


Input

1 2


Output

1.0000000000000000

Note

In the first sample, with probability <image> Alex will perform the trick with two cards with the same value from two different decks. In this case the trick is guaranteed to succeed.

With the remaining <image> probability he took two different cards, and the probability of pulling off the trick is <image>.

The resulting probability is <image>

Solution (C++ code):
{solution}


assistant: ### Phase 3: Implementing the Natural Language Invariants in C++

Let's translate the previously derived performance-characterizing invariants into C++ runtime checks. Each invariant will be implemented as a separate check.

1. **Large Vector Operations Check**:
   - Check if both `n` and `m` are large, leading to large vectors being involved in operations.
   
   ```cpp
   void check_large_vector_invariant(int n, int m) {
       if (n > 900 && m > 900) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to large vectors!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Iterative Overhead Check**:
   - Check when the loop iterates for a large number of `k` values with large values of `n` and `m`.
   
   ```cpp
   void check_iterative_overhead_invariant(int n, int m, int k) {
       if (k > 900 && n > 900 && m > 900) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to iterative overhead!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }

3. **Quadratic Complexity in Vector Operations**:
   - Check for operations that grow quadratically with `n` and `m`, causing performance issues.
   
   ```cpp
   void check_quadratic_complexity_invariant(int n, int m) {
       if (n * m > 900 * 900) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to quadratic complexity!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Integrating Checks into the Original Program

Now, let's integrate these checks into the provided C++ program. We'll place the checks where they can effectively prevent slow execution without adding significant overhead.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int n, m;

void check_large_vector_invariant(int n, int m) {
    if (n > 900 && m > 900) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to large vectors!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_iterative_overhead_invariant(int n, int m, int k) {
    if (k > 900 && n > 900 && m > 900) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to iterative overhead!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_quadratic_complexity_invariant(int n, int m) {
    if (n * m > 900 * 900) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to quadratic complexity!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

long double p(int k) {
    vector<long double> A, B;
    for (int i = m - k + 1; i < m + 1; i++)
        if (i > 0)
            A.push_back(i);
        else if (i < 0)
            return 0;
    for (int i = n - k + 1; i < n + 1; i++)
        if (i > 0)
            A.push_back(i);
        else if (i < 0)
            return 0;
    for (int i = m * n - m - n + k + 1; i < m * n - m + 1; i++)
        if (i > 0)
            A.push_back(i);
        else if (i < 0)
            return 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < k + 1; i++)
        if (i > 0)
            B.push_back(i);
        else if (i < 0)
            return 0;
    for (int i = m * n - n + 1; i < m * n + 1; i++)
        if (i > 0)
            B.push_back(i);
        else if (i < 0)
            return 0;
    sort((A).rbegin(), (A).rend());
    sort((B).rbegin(), (B).rend());
    long double res = 1;
    while (B.size() < A.size()) B.push_back(1);
    while (A.size() < B.size()) A.push_back(1);
    for (int i = 0; i < A.size(); i++) res *= A[i] / B[i];
    return res;
}

int main() {
    cin >> n >> m;
    
    // Insert checks after reading input
    check_large_vector_invariant(n, m);
    check_quadratic_complexity_invariant(n, m);
    
    long double res = 0;
    for (int k = 1; k < min(n, m) + 1; k++) {
        check_iterative_overhead_invariant(n, m, k); // Check within the loop for specific k
        res += p(k) * k * k / n;
    }
    
    printf("%.09f\n", (double)res);
}
```

### Explanation:

- **Large Vector Operations Check**: This check is placed after reading the input to immediately abort if `n` and `m` are both large, suggesting potential large vector operations.
- **Iterative Overhead Check**: Placed inside the loop in `main()` to monitor each iteration's impact when `k`, `n`, and `m` are large.
- **Quadratic Complexity Check**: Also placed after input reading to catch potential issues from large `n` and `m` leading to quadratic growth in operations.

These integrated checks help identify conditions triggering performance bottlenecks, effectively aiding in performance analysis and debugging.
