### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Comparison of Line-Level Hit Counts**:
   - **Function `C(int x, int y)`**:
     - Lines 8-12 of the function `C` show significant disparity in hit counts between the slow and fast inputs. Specifically, line 10 and line 11 have `1998999` hits for the slow input compared to just `5` hits for the fast input. This indicates heavy use of this function with the slow input.
   - **Loop in `main()` Function**:
     - The loop on line 18 is executed `1000` times for the slow input but only `2` times for the fast input. This suggests that the slow input triggers more iterations, directly impacting performance.

2. **Inferred Interactions**:
   - The function `C` is a combinatorial function that likely calculates binomial coefficients using logarithms, designed to avoid overflow issues. The loops within `C` (lines 10 and 11) iterate over ranges derived from parameters `x` and `y`, which are large for the slow input.
   - The for loop in `main()` (line 18) iterates `min(n, m)` times, which is significantly larger for the slow input, causing the function `C` to be called repeatedly, each time with large arguments, leading to high computational overhead.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **Natural Language Performance Invariants**:

   - **Large Iterations in Nested Loop**:
     - "When both `n` and `m` are large, the outer loop in the main function iterates many times. This can lead to excessive computation within nested calls to the combinatorial function `C`, significantly slowing down the program."

   - **Expensive Combinatorial Calculations**:
     - "The program's performance degrades when the combinatorial function is repeatedly called with large parameters, leading to numerous logarithmic calculations. This often occurs when the number of decks (`m`) and cards in each deck (`n`) are both large."

2. **Suggested Thresholds Aligned with Constraints**:
   - The constraints allow up to 1000 for both `n` and `m`, but performance issues arise significantly as these parameters approach this upper limit, especially when both are large simultaneously.

3. **Broad Conditions for Slow Execution**:
   - "If both `n` and `m` are close to 1000, the combination of large loop iterations and expensive combinatorial calculations leads to a slowdown."
   - "When `n` and `m` are both large, consider the computational complexity of nested loops and the cost of logarithmic operations in combinatorial computations."

These invariants help identify conditions under which the algorithm becomes inefficient and serve as guidelines for detecting potential slow execution scenarios during testing or fuzzing.

### Phase 3: Implement the Natural Language Invariants as C++ Checker Code

Here are the performance-characterizing invariants translated into C++ checker code:

#### Invariant 1: Large Iterations in Nested Loop
```cpp
void check_large_iteration_invariant(int n, int m) {
    if (n > 900 && m > 900) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large iterations in nested loops!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

#### Invariant 2: Expensive Combinatorial Calculations
```cpp
void check_expensive_calculations_invariant(int n, int m) {
    if (n > 900 && m > 900) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - expensive combinatorial calculations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrate Checker Code into the Program

Here is the instrumented C++ code with runtime checker code implemented:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#pragma comment(linker, "/STACK:36777216")
using namespace std;
const int N = 30005;
const long long INF = 0x3fffffffffffffffLL;
const int MOD = 1e9 + 7;
const long double EPS = 1e-8;

// Checker function for large iterations in nested loop
void check_large_iteration_invariant(int n, int m) {
    if (n > 900 && m > 900) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large iterations in nested loops!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Checker function for expensive combinatorial calculations
void check_expensive_calculations_invariant(int n, int m) {
    if (n > 900 && m > 900) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - expensive combinatorial calculations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

long double C(int x, int y) {
    long double res = 0.0;
    for (int i = x - y + 1; i <= x; i++) res += log((long double)i);
    for (int i = 1; i <= y; i++) res -= log((long double)i);
    return res;
}

int main() {
    int n, m;
    cin >> n >> m;

    // Insert checkers to detect performance bottlenecks
    check_large_iteration_invariant(n, m);
    check_expensive_calculations_invariant(n, m);

    long double ans = 0.0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= min(n, m); i++) {
        long double k = C(m, i) + C(n * m - m, n - i) - C(n * m, n);
        k += 2 * log((long double)i);
        k -= 2 * log((long double)n);
        ans += exp(k);
    }
    cout << setprecision(20) << ans * n << endl;
}
```

### Explanation

- **Checker Placement**: The checkers are placed right after reading the input values for `n` and `m`. This ensures that the conditions are checked before any expensive computation occurs, thus preventing unnecessary processing when the bottleneck conditions are met.
- **Thresholds**: The chosen threshold of `900` aligns with the provided constraint that `n` and `m` can be up to `1000`. This threshold is high enough to capture scenarios that are likely to impact performance due to large iterations or computations.
- **Warnings and Abort**: If any condition is met, a descriptive warning message is displayed, followed by an `abort()` statement to halt the program. This helps in identifying performance issues during testing.
