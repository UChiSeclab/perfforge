system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

Alex enjoys performing magic tricks. He has a trick that requires a deck of n cards. He has m identical decks of n different cards each, which have been mixed together. When Alex wishes to perform the trick, he grabs n cards at random and performs the trick with those. The resulting deck looks like a normal deck, but may have duplicates of some cards.

The trick itself is performed as follows: first Alex allows you to choose a random card from the deck. You memorize the card and put it back in the deck. Then Alex shuffles the deck, and pulls out a card. If the card matches the one you memorized, the trick is successful.

You don't think Alex is a very good magician, and that he just pulls a card randomly from the deck. Determine the probability of the trick being successful if this is the case.

Input

First line of the input consists of two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000), separated by space — number of cards in each deck, and number of decks.

Output

On the only line of the output print one floating point number – probability of Alex successfully performing the trick. Relative or absolute error of your answer should not be higher than 10 - 6.

Examples

Note

In the first sample, with probability <image> Alex will perform the trick with two cards with the same value from two different decks. In this case the trick is guaranteed to succeed.

With the remaining <image> probability he took two different cards, and the probability of pulling off the trick is <image>.

The resulting probability is <image>

assistant: Let's analyze the given C program and identify potential performance bottlenecks. The key function in the program is `rec(int pos, int taken)`, a recursive function that calculates the probability of successfully performing the trick. Let's go through the process:

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

#### Step 1: Compare Line-Level Hit Counts
- **Line 11 (function call):** `slow_hit_count: 997003`, `fast_hit_count: 1`
- **Line 13 (memoization check):** `slow_hit_count: 995007`, `fast_hit_count: 0`
- **Line 14 (probability calculation):** `slow_hit_count: 498501`, `fast_hit_count: 0`
- **Line 15 (recursive calculation):** `slow_hit_count: 498501`, `fast_hit_count: 0`

#### Step 2: Pinpoint Lines or Functions with More Hits
- **Function `rec`:** The recursive function `rec` is called many more times in the slow input compared to the fast input. Line 11 indicates this as it has been hit almost a million times during the slow input run, whereas only once during the fast input.

#### Step 3: Infer Interaction with Data Structures
- The recursion seems to be deeply nested or has high branching, likely because it explores many possible combinations of `pos` and `taken`. The memoization on line 13 helps but does not completely eliminate repeated calculations, as indicated by the high hit counts.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the analysis, here are some performance-characterizing invariants in natural language:

1. **Invariant: High Recursion Depth and Branching**
   - Natural Language: "If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level due to high values of `n` and `m`, the computation becomes expensive. This is especially true when exploring combinations where `pos` approaches `m` and `taken` approaches `n`."
   - Explanation: The hit counts suggest that the function explores a vast search space, especially when both `n` and `m` are large. The recursion tries multiple paths, leading to extensive calls when `pos` and `taken` reach their upper limits.

2. **Invariant: Inefficient Memoization Use**
   - Natural Language: "When memoization is not effectively reducing repeated calculations due to the unique combinations of `pos` and `taken`, performance may degrade."
   - Explanation: Although memoization should theoretically help, the high number of calls at line 13 indicates that many unique states are being processed, reducing the efficiency of caching.

3. **Invariant: Large Recursive Search Space**
   - Natural Language: "The recursive function explores a combinatorial space influenced by `n` and `m`. As both approach their limits (close to 1000), the number of potential states increases exponentially, slowing the program."
   - Explanation: The recursive nature combined with large input size leads to an exponential growth in the number of paths the algorithm explores, causing a slowdown.

### Conclusion

The slow performance in the given input is primarily due to the extensive recursive nature of the solution, especially with large `n` and `m`. The memoization attempts to mitigate this but isn't enough when facing the vast combination of states. Addressing these invariants could involve optimizing the recursion or increasing the efficiency of memoization.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
Alex enjoys performing magic tricks. He has a trick that requires a deck of n cards. He has m identical decks of n different cards each, which have been mixed together. When Alex wishes to perform the trick, he grabs n cards at random and performs the trick with those. The resulting deck looks like a normal deck, but may have duplicates of some cards.

The trick itself is performed as follows: first Alex allows you to choose a random card from the deck. You memorize the card and put it back in the deck. Then Alex shuffles the deck, and pulls out a card. If the card matches the one you memorized, the trick is successful.

You don't think Alex is a very good magician, and that he just pulls a card randomly from the deck. Determine the probability of the trick being successful if this is the case.

Input

First line of the input consists of two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000), separated by space — number of cards in each deck, and number of decks.

Output

On the only line of the output print one floating point number – probability of Alex successfully performing the trick. Relative or absolute error of your answer should not be higher than 10 - 6.

Note

In the first sample, with probability <image> Alex will perform the trick with two cards with the same value from two different decks. In this case the trick is guaranteed to succeed.

With the remaining <image> probability he took two different cards, and the probability of pulling off the trick is <image>.

The resulting probability is <image>

Solution (C++ code):
{solution}


assistant: Let's proceed with the task by first translating the natural language invariants into C++ code checks (Phase 3), and then integrating these checks into the original C++ program (Phase 4).

### Phase 3: Implement the Natural Language Invariants in C++

#### Invariant 1: High Recursion Depth and Branching
This check focuses on detecting when the recursion depth and branching could lead to a performance bottleneck.

```cpp
void check_recursion_invariant(int pos, int taken, int n, int m) {
    if (pos >= m - 10 || taken >= n - 10) {  // Threshold chosen to warn before reaching maximum depth
        cerr << "Warning: Recursion invariant triggered - high depth/branching" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

#### Invariant 2: Inefficient Memoization Use
This checks if the memoization table is being heavily used, which might indicate inefficiency in avoiding redundant calculations due to large input sizes.

```cpp
void check_memoization_invariant(bool isMemoized) {
    if (!isMemoized) {
        cerr << "Warning: Memoization invariant triggered - inefficient caching" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

#### Invariant 3: Large Recursive Search Space
This checks if both `n` and `m` are large, which indicates a potentially large recursive search space.

```cpp
void check_large_search_space_invariant(int n, int m) {
    if (n > 990 && m > 990) {  // Close to the maximum allowed values
        cerr << "Warning: Large search space invariant triggered" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrate Checks into the Original Program

Now we will integrate these checks into the provided C++ code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#pragma comment(linker, "/STACK:200000000")

const double EPS = 1E-9;
const int INF = 1000000000;
const long long INF64 = (long long)1E18;
const double PI = 3.1415926535897932384626433832795;

int n, m;
bool u[1100][1100];
double z[1100][1100];

void check_recursion_invariant(int pos, int taken, int n, int m) {
    if (pos >= m - 10 || taken >= n - 10) {
        cerr << "Warning: Recursion invariant triggered - high depth/branching" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_memoization_invariant(bool isMemoized) {
    if (!isMemoized) {
        cerr << "Warning: Memoization invariant triggered - inefficient caching" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_large_search_space_invariant(int n, int m) {
    if (n > 990 && m > 990) {
        cerr << "Warning: Large search space invariant triggered" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

double rec(int pos, int taken) {
    check_recursion_invariant(pos, taken, n, m); // Check for recursion depth and branching

    if (taken == n || pos == m) return double(taken) / n;
    
    bool isMemoized = u[pos][taken];
    check_memoization_invariant(isMemoized); // Check memoization efficiency

    if (isMemoized) return z[pos][taken];
    
    double p = (n - taken) / double(n * m - pos);
    double res = rec(pos + 1, taken + 1) * p + rec(pos + 1, taken) * (1 - p);
    u[pos][taken] = true;
    return z[pos][taken] = res;
}

int main() {
    cin >> n >> m;

    check_large_search_space_invariant(n, m); // Check for large recursive search space

    double res = rec(1, 1);
    printf("%.10lf\n", res);
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Recursion Invariant:** Added just before the recursive calls to check for approaching the maximum recursion depth or high branching.
- **Memoization Invariant:** Checked just before using the memoization table to ensure efficiency.
- **Large Search Space Invariant:** Checked right after reading the input to warn if `n` and `m` are very high, indicative of exploring a large search space.

These checks are designed to help a fuzzer or developer quickly understand potential performance issues without significantly impacting the program's runtime performance.
