=== Invariants Response ===
Let's analyze the given C program and identify potential performance bottlenecks. The key function in the program is `rec(int pos, int taken)`, a recursive function that calculates the probability of successfully performing the trick. Let's go through the process:

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

#### Step 1: Compare Line-Level Hit Counts
- **Line 11 (function call):** `slow_hit_count: 997003`, `fast_hit_count: 1`
- **Line 13 (memoization check):** `slow_hit_count: 995007`, `fast_hit_count: 0`
- **Line 14 (probability calculation):** `slow_hit_count: 498501`, `fast_hit_count: 0`
- **Line 15 (recursive calculation):** `slow_hit_count: 498501`, `fast_hit_count: 0`

#### Step 2: Pinpoint Lines or Functions with More Hits
- **Function `rec`:** The recursive function `rec` is called many more times in the slow input compared to the fast input. Line 11 indicates this as it has been hit almost a million times during the slow input run, whereas only once during the fast input.

#### Step 3: Infer Interaction with Data Structures
- The recursion seems to be deeply nested or has high branching, likely because it explores many possible combinations of `pos` and `taken`. The memoization on line 13 helps but does not completely eliminate repeated calculations, as indicated by the high hit counts.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the analysis, here are some performance-characterizing invariants in natural language:

1. **Invariant: High Recursion Depth and Branching**
   - Natural Language: "If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level due to high values of `n` and `m`, the computation becomes expensive. This is especially true when exploring combinations where `pos` approaches `m` and `taken` approaches `n`."
   - Explanation: The hit counts suggest that the function explores a vast search space, especially when both `n` and `m` are large. The recursion tries multiple paths, leading to extensive calls when `pos` and `taken` reach their upper limits.

2. **Invariant: Inefficient Memoization Use**
   - Natural Language: "When memoization is not effectively reducing repeated calculations due to the unique combinations of `pos` and `taken`, performance may degrade."
   - Explanation: Although memoization should theoretically help, the high number of calls at line 13 indicates that many unique states are being processed, reducing the efficiency of caching.

3. **Invariant: Large Recursive Search Space**
   - Natural Language: "The recursive function explores a combinatorial space influenced by `n` and `m`. As both approach their limits (close to 1000), the number of potential states increases exponentially, slowing the program."
   - Explanation: The recursive nature combined with large input size leads to an exponential growth in the number of paths the algorithm explores, causing a slowdown.

### Conclusion

The slow performance in the given input is primarily due to the extensive recursive nature of the solution, especially with large `n` and `m`. The memoization attempts to mitigate this but isn't enough when facing the vast combination of states. Addressing these invariants could involve optimizing the recursion or increasing the efficiency of memoization.

=== Checker Response ===
Let's proceed with the task by first translating the natural language invariants into C++ code checks (Phase 3), and then integrating these checks into the original C++ program (Phase 4).

### Phase 3: Implement the Natural Language Invariants in C++

#### Invariant 1: High Recursion Depth and Branching
This check focuses on detecting when the recursion depth and branching could lead to a performance bottleneck.

```cpp
void check_recursion_invariant(int pos, int taken, int n, int m) {
    if (pos >= m - 10 || taken >= n - 10) {  // Threshold chosen to warn before reaching maximum depth
        cerr << "Warning: Recursion invariant triggered - high depth/branching" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

#### Invariant 2: Inefficient Memoization Use
This checks if the memoization table is being heavily used, which might indicate inefficiency in avoiding redundant calculations due to large input sizes.

```cpp
void check_memoization_invariant(bool isMemoized) {
    if (!isMemoized) {
        cerr << "Warning: Memoization invariant triggered - inefficient caching" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

#### Invariant 3: Large Recursive Search Space
This checks if both `n` and `m` are large, which indicates a potentially large recursive search space.

```cpp
void check_large_search_space_invariant(int n, int m) {
    if (n > 990 && m > 990) {  // Close to the maximum allowed values
        cerr << "Warning: Large search space invariant triggered" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrate Checks into the Original Program

Now we will integrate these checks into the provided C++ code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#pragma comment(linker, "/STACK:200000000")

const double EPS = 1E-9;
const int INF = 1000000000;
const long long INF64 = (long long)1E18;
const double PI = 3.1415926535897932384626433832795;

int n, m;
bool u[1100][1100];
double z[1100][1100];

void check_recursion_invariant(int pos, int taken, int n, int m) {
    if (pos >= m - 10 || taken >= n - 10) {
        cerr << "Warning: Recursion invariant triggered - high depth/branching" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_memoization_invariant(bool isMemoized) {
    if (!isMemoized) {
        cerr << "Warning: Memoization invariant triggered - inefficient caching" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_large_search_space_invariant(int n, int m) {
    if (n > 990 && m > 990) {
        cerr << "Warning: Large search space invariant triggered" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

double rec(int pos, int taken) {
    check_recursion_invariant(pos, taken, n, m); // Check for recursion depth and branching

    if (taken == n || pos == m) return double(taken) / n;
    
    bool isMemoized = u[pos][taken];
    check_memoization_invariant(isMemoized); // Check memoization efficiency

    if (isMemoized) return z[pos][taken];
    
    double p = (n - taken) / double(n * m - pos);
    double res = rec(pos + 1, taken + 1) * p + rec(pos + 1, taken) * (1 - p);
    u[pos][taken] = true;
    return z[pos][taken] = res;
}

int main() {
    cin >> n >> m;

    check_large_search_space_invariant(n, m); // Check for large recursive search space

    double res = rec(1, 1);
    printf("%.10lf\n", res);
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Recursion Invariant:** Added just before the recursive calls to check for approaching the maximum recursion depth or high branching.
- **Memoization Invariant:** Checked just before using the memoization table to ensure efficiency.
- **Large Search Space Invariant:** Checked right after reading the input to warn if `n` and `m` are very high, indicative of exploring a large search space.

These checks are designed to help a fuzzer or developer quickly understand potential performance issues without significantly impacting the program's runtime performance.
