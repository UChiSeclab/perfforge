system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

Alex enjoys performing magic tricks. He has a trick that requires a deck of n cards. He has m identical decks of n different cards each, which have been mixed together. When Alex wishes to perform the trick, he grabs n cards at random and performs the trick with those. The resulting deck looks like a normal deck, but may have duplicates of some cards.

The trick itself is performed as follows: first Alex allows you to choose a random card from the deck. You memorize the card and put it back in the deck. Then Alex shuffles the deck, and pulls out a card. If the card matches the one you memorized, the trick is successful.

You don't think Alex is a very good magician, and that he just pulls a card randomly from the deck. Determine the probability of the trick being successful if this is the case.

Input

First line of the input consists of two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000), separated by space — number of cards in each deck, and number of decks.

Output

On the only line of the output print one floating point number – probability of Alex successfully performing the trick. Relative or absolute error of your answer should not be higher than 10 - 6.

Examples

Input

Output

0.6666666666666666

4 4


Output

0.4000000000000000


Input

1 2


Output

1.0000000000000000

Note

In the first sample, with probability <image> Alex will perform the trick with two cards with the same value from two different decks. In this case the trick is guaranteed to succeed.

With the remaining <image> probability he took two different cards, and the probability of pulling off the trick is <image>.

The resulting probability is <image>

assistant: ## Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

### Analysis of Line-Level Hit Counts

1. **Function `add` (Lines 6-8):**
   - **Line 7:** This line is hit 2,001,000 times with the slow input compared to only 10 times with the fast input. This indicates that the loop within this function is a major contributor to the slowdown.
   - The `add` function is called multiple times within the loop in `main`, significantly impacting performance when `n` and `m` are large.

2. **Main Loop Over `k` (Lines 13-23):**
   - **Line 21:** The loop iterating over `A.size()` is hit 1,999,000 times for the slow input. This indicates that the size of `A` and `B` is large, leading to a substantial number of multiplications which adds to the computational cost.
   - The `sort` operations on lines 18 and 19 also contribute to the slowdown due to the large size of vectors `A` and `B`.

### Interaction with Data Structures

- The vectors `A` and `B` grow significantly due to the repeated calls to `add`, leading to expensive operations such as sorting and iterating over large vectors.
- The operations inside the loop over `k` are computationally intensive when `n` and `m` are large, due to the increased number of iterations and large vector manipulations.

## Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

### Natural Language Performance Invariants

1. **Vector Size and Sorting Invariant:**
   - Natural language: "When the number of decks `m` and the number of cards per deck `n` are both large, the vectors used in computation grow significantly, leading to expensive sorting and iteration operations. This can slow the performance substantially."
   - Explanation: Large values of `n` and `m` lead to vectors `A` and `B` containing many elements, which results in expensive sorting operations and increased iteration cost in the loop over `k`.

2. **Loop Iteration Invariant:**
   - Natural language: "If `n` is close to its maximum value, the loop iterating over `k` becomes increasingly expensive due to the quadratic nature of operations involving elements of vectors `A` and `B`."
   - Explanation: The loop iterates over `k` from `0` to `n`, and for each `k`, additional operations cause the cumulative cost to grow with increasing `n`.

3. **Multiplicative Accumulation Invariant:**
   - Natural language: "With large `n` and `m`, the accumulation of multiplication operations over a large number of elements in vectors `A` and `B` leads to a performance bottleneck."
   - Explanation: The multiplication operation inside the loop (Line 21) becomes costly as it involves a large number of elements, particularly when `A` and `B` are large, resulting in a large number of operations.

### Summary

To mitigate the slow performance, one should be cautious when both `n` and `m` approach their upper constraint limits. Optimizing how vectors `A` and `B` are managed, reducing sorting costs, or minimizing the number of operations in the multiplicative loop can help improve performance under these conditions.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
Alex enjoys performing magic tricks. He has a trick that requires a deck of n cards. He has m identical decks of n different cards each, which have been mixed together. When Alex wishes to perform the trick, he grabs n cards at random and performs the trick with those. The resulting deck looks like a normal deck, but may have duplicates of some cards.

The trick itself is performed as follows: first Alex allows you to choose a random card from the deck. You memorize the card and put it back in the deck. Then Alex shuffles the deck, and pulls out a card. If the card matches the one you memorized, the trick is successful.

You don't think Alex is a very good magician, and that he just pulls a card randomly from the deck. Determine the probability of the trick being successful if this is the case.

Input

First line of the input consists of two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000), separated by space — number of cards in each deck, and number of decks.

Output

On the only line of the output print one floating point number – probability of Alex successfully performing the trick. Relative or absolute error of your answer should not be higher than 10 - 6.

In the first sample, with probability <image> Alex will perform the trick with two cards with the same value from two different decks. In this case the trick is guaranteed to succeed.

With the remaining <image> probability he took two different cards, and the probability of pulling off the trick is <image>.

The resulting probability is <image>

Solution (C++ code):
{solution}


assistant: ## Phase 3: Implement the Natural Language Invariants as Runtime Checks in C++

Here, I'll implement checker functions based on the performance-characterizing invariants derived earlier:

### Checker for Vector Size and Sorting Invariant

```cpp
void check_vector_size_invariant(int n, int m, int A_size, int B_size) {
    if ((n > 500 && m > 500) && (A_size > 10000 || B_size > 10000)) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to large vector sizes leading to expensive sorting!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Checker for Loop Iteration Invariant

```cpp
void check_loop_iteration_invariant(int n) {
    if (n > 500) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to large number of loop iterations over k!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Checker for Multiplicative Accumulation Invariant

```cpp
void check_multiplicative_accumulation_invariant(int n, int m, int A_size, int B_size) {
    if ((n > 500 && m > 500) && (A_size * B_size > 1000000)) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to excessive multiplicative operations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

## Phase 4: Integrate the Checker Code into the Original Program

Now, I will integrate these checks into the C++ program at appropriate points to prevent adding overhead in tight loops:

### Instrumented C++ Code

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#pragma comment(linker, "/STACK:500000000")
using namespace std;

void check_vector_size_invariant(int n, int m, int A_size, int B_size) {
    if ((n > 500 && m > 500) && (A_size > 10000 || B_size > 10000)) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to large vector sizes leading to expensive sorting!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_loop_iteration_invariant(int n) {
    if (n > 500) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to large number of loop iterations over k!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_multiplicative_accumulation_invariant(int n, int m, int A_size, int B_size) {
    if ((n > 500 && m > 500) && (A_size * B_size > 1000000)) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to excessive multiplicative operations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

double C[1009][1009];
vector<int> A, B;

void add(int n, int k, vector<int> &A, vector<int> &B) {
    for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) B.push_back(k - i), A.push_back(n - i);
}

int main() {
    int n, m;
    scanf("%d %d", &n, &m);

    // Insert check for loop iteration invariant
    check_loop_iteration_invariant(n);

    double res = 0;
    for (int k = 0; k <= n; k++) {
        A.clear(), B.clear();
        add(m, k, A, B);
        add(n * m - m, n - k, A, B);
        add(n * m, n, B, A);

        // Insert check for vector size and sorting invariant
        check_vector_size_invariant(n, m, A.size(), B.size());

        sort(A.begin(), A.end());
        sort(B.begin(), B.end());

        double ml = 1.0 * k * k / n / n;

        // Insert check for multiplicative accumulation invariant
        check_multiplicative_accumulation_invariant(n, m, A.size(), B.size());

        for (int i = 0; i < A.size(); i++) ml *= 1.0 * A[i] / B[i];
        res += ml;
    }
    
    printf("%.13f\n", n * res);
}
```

### Comments on Checker Placement

- **`check_loop_iteration_invariant`** is placed after reading the inputs to immediately catch the potential bottleneck caused by a large number of iterations.
- **`check_vector_size_invariant`** is placed after the `add` calls but before sorting to identify when vector sizes exceed the threshold and lead to expensive operations.
- **`check_multiplicative_accumulation_invariant`** is placed before the loop iterating over `A.size()` to monitor the excessive multiplicative operations due to large vectors. 

These checks will help identify performance bottlenecks during runtime, especially beneficial for fuzz testing or when scaling up inputs.
