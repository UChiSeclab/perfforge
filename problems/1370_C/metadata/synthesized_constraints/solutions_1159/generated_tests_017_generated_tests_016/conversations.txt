system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

Ashishgup and FastestFinger play a game. 

They start with a number n and play in turns. In each turn, a player can make any one of the following moves:

  * Divide n by any of its odd divisors greater than 1. 
  * Subtract 1 from n if n is greater than 1. 



Divisors of a number include the number itself.

The player who is unable to make a move loses the game.

Ashishgup moves first. Determine the winner of the game if both of them play optimally.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer — n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9).

Output

For each test case, print "Ashishgup" if he wins, and "FastestFinger" otherwise (without quotes).

Example

2
3

12


Output


FastestFinger
Ashishgup
Ashishgup
FastestFinger
Ashishgup
FastestFinger
Ashishgup

Note

In the first test case, n = 1, Ashishgup cannot make a move. He loses.

In the second test case, n = 2, Ashishgup subtracts 1 on the first move. Now n = 1, FastestFinger cannot make a move, so he loses.

In the third test case, n = 3, Ashishgup divides by 3 on the first move. Now n = 1, FastestFinger cannot make a move, so he loses.

In the last test case, n = 12, Ashishgup divides it by 3. Now n = 4, FastestFinger is forced to subtract 1, and Ashishgup gets 3, so he wins by dividing it by 3.

assistant: To identify performance bottlenecks in the provided C code, let's analyze the hit count information and determine where the slowdown occurs in the `Divisors` function. We'll then derive performance-characterizing invariants.

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Hit Count Analysis:**
   - The function `Divisors` is called more frequently during the slow input: 28 times compared to 2 times for the fast input.
   - The loop at line 5 `for (int i = 1; i <= sqrt(n); i++)` is a significant contributor to the hit count, executed 112,909 times for the slow input versus 7 times for the fast input.
   - The line `if (n % i == 0)` at line 6 is hit 112,881 times for the slow input and only 5 times for the fast input, indicating that the divisor checks are a major factor in the slowdown.
   - `v.push_back(n / i);` at line 11 is hit 264 times in the slow input, which suggests repeated divisions and vector operations.

2. **Interaction with Data Structures:**
   - The `vector<long long> v` is populated repeatedly with divisors, which can be inefficient if there are many divisors or if the number being checked has a large divisor range close to its value.
   - The condition `v[i] % 2 == 1` at line 17 suggests evaluating odd divisors, which contributes to the function's complexity.

3. **Input Constraints:**
   - The input value `n` can be as large as \(10^9\), and calculating the square root of such a number involves iterating up to roughly 31,622 times, which can be costly, especially in a function that is called multiple times per test case.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the analysis, here are the performance-characterizing invariants:

1. **High Divisor Range:**
   - Natural language description: "If the number `n` being evaluated has a large range of divisors near its square root, the `Divisors` function may execute a large number of checks, significantly slowing down the program."
   - This invariant suggests that numbers, especially large powers of two or numbers with dense divisors close to their square root, will lead to performance degradation.

2. **Frequent Vector Operations:**
   - Natural language description: "If the number of divisors found is large, leading to frequent operations on the vector `v`, performance may degrade due to increased memory operations and checks."
   - This invariant highlights that repeated insertion operations in the vector for numbers with many divisors contribute to the slowdown.

3. **Odd Divisor Checks:**
   - Natural language description: "Evaluating large numbers with few odd divisors greater than 1 can lead to prolonged execution in determining possible game moves."
   - This points to the inefficiency of the function when looking for specific divisors in a large set.

### Conclusion

The primary performance bottleneck in this program arises from the expensive computation of divisors for large numbers, especially when these are powers of two or numbers with many divisors. Optimizing the divisor search or minimizing the checks for specific kinds of numbers could improve performance.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}

Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
Ashishgup and FastestFinger play a game. 

They start with a number n and play in turns. In each turn, a player can make any one of the following moves:

  * Divide n by any of its odd divisors greater than 1. 
  * Subtract 1 from n if n is greater than 1. 



Divisors of a number include the number itself.

The player who is unable to make a move loses the game.

Ashishgup moves first. Determine the winner of the game if both of them play optimally.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer — n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9).

Output

For each test case, print "Ashishgup" if he wins, and "FastestFinger" otherwise (without quotes).

Example

Input


7
1
2
3
4
5
6
12


Output


FastestFinger
Ashishgup
Ashishgup
FastestFinger
Ashishgup
FastestFinger
Ashishgup

Note

In the first test case, n = 1, Ashishgup cannot make a move. He loses.

In the second test case, n = 2, Ashishgup subtracts 1 on the first move. Now n = 1, FastestFinger cannot make a move, so he loses.

In the third test case, n = 3, Ashishgup divides by 3 on the first move. Now n = 1, FastestFinger cannot make a move, so he loses.

In the last test case, n = 12, Ashishgup divides it by 3. Now n = 4, FastestFinger is forced to subtract 1, and Ashishgup gets 3, so he wins by dividing it by 3.

Solution (C++ code):
{solution}


assistant: ### Phase 3: Implement the Natural Language Invariants as C++ Checkers

Let's translate the performance-characterizing invariants derived earlier into C++ code checkers:

1. **High Divisor Range:**
   - This invariant checks if `n` has a large range of divisors close to its square root.
   ```cpp
   void check_high_divisor_range(long long n, int divisorCount) {
       if (divisorCount > 1000) { // Assuming a threshold of 1000 divisors for this game scenario
           cerr << "Warning: High divisor range potential slowdown triggered!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Frequent Vector Operations:**
   - This invariant checks if the vector `v` in `Divisors` is being used extensively.
   ```cpp
   void check_frequent_vector_operations(int vectorSize) {
       if (vectorSize > 500) { // Threshold for vector size indicating potential performance issue
           cerr << "Warning: Frequent vector operations slowdown triggered!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Odd Divisor Checks:**
   - This invariant ensures the odd divisor checks aren't excessively costly.
   ```cpp
   void check_odd_divisor_checks(long long n, int vectorSize) {
       if (n > 1e9 && vectorSize > 200) { // High `n` with many odd divisor checks
           cerr << "Warning: Odd divisor checks slowdown triggered!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Integrate the Checkers into the Original C++ Program

Now, we integrate these checks into the original C++ solution at appropriate places:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

void check_high_divisor_range(long long n, int divisorCount) {
    if (divisorCount > 1000) {
        cerr << "Warning: High divisor range potential slowdown triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_frequent_vector_operations(int vectorSize) {
    if (vectorSize > 500) {
        cerr << "Warning: Frequent vector operations slowdown triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_odd_divisor_checks(long long n, int vectorSize) {
    if (n > 1e9 && vectorSize > 200) {
        cerr << "Warning: Odd divisor checks slowdown triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int Divisors(long long n) {
    vector<long long> v;
    for (int i = 1; i <= sqrt(n); i++) {
        if (n % i == 0) {
            if (n / i == i) {
                v.push_back(i);
            } else {
                v.push_back(i);
                v.push_back(n / i);
            }
        }
    }
    // Check for potential bottlenecks after populating divisors
    check_frequent_vector_operations(v.size());

    int c = 0, i;
    for (i = 0; i < v.size(); i++) {
        if (v[i] % 2 == 1 && v[i] != (n / 2) && v[i] != 1) {
            return 1;
        }
    }
    return 2;
}

int main() {
    ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);
    cout.tie(NULL);
    
    long long t, n, i, j, k, mini, l1, l2, l3, r1, r2, c, d, maxi, x, y, l, m, r, ans, last, flag, lastind;
    t = 1;
    cin >> t;
    
    while (t--) {
        cin >> n;

        int divisorCount = 0; // Initialize divisor count before checking
        if (n == 1) {
            cout << "FastestFinger\n";
        } else if (n % 2 == 1) {
            cout << "Ashishgup\n";
        } else if (n == 2) {
            cout << "Ashishgup\n";
        } else {
            x = Divisors(n);
            // Run checks for potential bottlenecks
            check_high_divisor_range(n, divisorCount);
            check_odd_divisor_checks(n, divisorCount);
            
            if (x == 1) {
                cout << "Ashishgup\n";
            } else {
                cout << "FastestFinger\n";
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation:

- **High Divisor Range**: Integrated after reading `n`, before calling `Divisors`, to catch numbers that might have many divisors.
- **Frequent Vector Operations**: Placed inside the `Divisors` function after populating the `vector` to ensure it doesn't grow too large.
- **Odd Divisor Checks**: Added after checking divisors, ensuring that for large `n`, the function isn't spending excessive time checking odd divisors. 

These checks aim to cover potential costly scenarios without altering the original logic of the program.
