system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

Ashishgup and FastestFinger play a game. 

They start with a number n and play in turns. In each turn, a player can make any one of the following moves:

  * Divide n by any of its odd divisors greater than 1. 
  * Subtract 1 from n if n is greater than 1. 



Divisors of a number include the number itself.

The player who is unable to make a move loses the game.

Ashishgup moves first. Determine the winner of the game if both of them play optimally.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer — n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9).

Output

For each test case, print "Ashishgup" if he wins, and "FastestFinger" otherwise (without quotes).

Output

Note

In the first test case, n = 1, Ashishgup cannot make a move. He loses.

In the second test case, n = 2, Ashishgup subtracts 1 on the first move. Now n = 1, FastestFinger cannot make a move, so he loses.

In the third test case, n = 3, Ashishgup divides by 3 on the first move. Now n = 1, FastestFinger cannot make a move, so he loses.

In the last test case, n = 12, Ashishgup divides it by 3. Now n = 4, FastestFinger is forced to subtract 1, and Ashishgup gets 3, so he wins by dividing it by 3.

assistant: Based on the hit count analysis of both the slow and fast inputs, we can deduce the conditions under which the program experiences performance slowdowns. Here's a breakdown of the analysis and the resulting performance-characterizing invariants:

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Hit Count Analysis:**
   - The line `for (long long int i = 2; i <= sqrt(n); i++)` (line 29) shows a dramatically higher hit count in the slow input compared to the fast input.
   - The lines within this loop, specifically the conditional `if (n % i == 0)` (line 30) and the subsequent logic, are also hit significantly more often in the slow input.

2. **Analysis of the Loop:**
   - The loop iterates over all potential divisors up to the square root of `n`. For large even numbers or numbers with a large number of divisors, this loop will execute many times, especially for numbers that are powers of 2.

3. **Potential Bottleneck:**
   - The loop's execution time increases with the number of iterations, which is heavily dependent on the structure of `n`, particularly if `n` is a highly composite number or a power of two.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the above analysis, here are the performance-characterizing invariants in natural language:

1. **Invariant 1: Large Even Number Handling**
   - Natural Language Description: "If `n` is a large even number, especially a power of two, the program may slow down significantly due to excessive divisor checking operations."
   - Explanation: The loop checks all numbers up to `sqrt(n)`, and for large powers of two, this results in many unnecessary checks, as such numbers have fewer useful odd divisors.

2. **Invariant 2: Highly Composite Numbers**
   - Natural Language Description: "For numbers with many divisors, particularly those close to perfect squares, performance may degrade as the code iterates through many divisor checks."
   - Explanation: The computational overhead is increased when `n` has many divisors, resulting in more iterations and checks within the loop.

3. **Invariant 3: Odd Divisor Check Optimization**
   - Natural Language Description: "When `n` is large and composed primarily of small prime factors, the program may enter a slow path due to repeated divisor checks without early exits."
   - Explanation: Because the program cannot quickly eliminate non-useful divisors, it wastes time checking divisors unnecessarily.

These invariants highlight the key scenarios where the code's performance can degrade due to the input's structure, rather than the size, aligning with the given constraints (e.g., `t <= 100`, `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9`). By considering these scenarios, future inputs that align with these characteristics can be anticipated to exhibit similar performance issues.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
Ashishgup and FastestFinger play a game. 

They start with a number n and play in turns. In each turn, a player can make any one of the following moves:

  * Divide n by any of its odd divisors greater than 1. 
  * Subtract 1 from n if n is greater than 1. 



Divisors of a number include the number itself.

The player who is unable to make a move loses the game.

Ashishgup moves first. Determine the winner of the game if both of them play optimally.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer — n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9).

Output

For each test case, print "Ashishgup" if he wins, and "FastestFinger" otherwise (without quotes).

Example

Input

1
2
3
4
5
6
12


Output


FastestFinger
Ashishgup
Ashishgup
FastestFinger
Ashishgup
FastestFinger
Ashishgup

Note

In the first test case, n = 1, Ashishgup cannot make a move. He loses.

In the second test case, n = 2, Ashishgup subtracts 1 on the first move. Now n = 1, FastestFinger cannot make a move, so he loses.

In the third test case, n = 3, Ashishgup divides by 3 on the first move. Now n = 1, FastestFinger cannot make a move, so he loses.

In the last test case, n = 12, Ashishgup divides it by 3. Now n = 4, FastestFinger is forced to subtract 1, and Ashishgup gets 3, so he wins by dividing it by 3.

assistant: ### Phase 3: Implementing the Natural Language Invariants in C++

Below are the C++ code snippets that implement the performance-characterizing invariants derived from the natural language descriptions:

#### Invariant 1: Large Even Number Handling
```cpp
void check_large_even_number(long long int n) {
    // Check if n is a large even number, especially a power of two
    if (n > 2 && (n & (n - 1)) == 0) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered for large even number (power of two)!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

#### Invariant 2: Highly Composite Numbers
```cpp
void check_highly_composite_number(long long int n) {
    // Check if n is a highly composite number by estimating a threshold
    // For simplicity, assume high composite numbers have large number of divisors
    int divisorCount = 0;
    for (long long int i = 1; i <= sqrt(n); ++i) {
        if (n % i == 0) {
            divisorCount += (i * i != n) ? 2 : 1;
        }
    }
    if (divisorCount > 20) {  // Arbitrary threshold for high composite
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered for highly composite number!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

#### Invariant 3: Odd Divisor Check Optimization
```cpp
void check_odd_divisor_optimization(long long int n) {
    // Check if n is large and composed primarily of small prime factors
    if (n > 1000000) {  // Use a heuristic threshold
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered for odd divisor optimization!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrating the Checkers into the Original Program

Below is the modified C++ program with the integrated checker functions:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Checker for large even numbers, especially powers of two
void check_large_even_number(long long int n) {
    if (n > 2 && (n & (n - 1)) == 0) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered for large even number (power of two)!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Checker for highly composite numbers
void check_highly_composite_number(long long int n) {
    int divisorCount = 0;
    for (long long int i = 1; i <= sqrt(n); ++i) {
        if (n % i == 0) {
            divisorCount += (i * i != n) ? 2 : 1;
        }
    }
    if (divisorCount > 20) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered for highly composite number!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Checker for odd divisor optimization
void check_odd_divisor_optimization(long long int n) {
    if (n > 1000000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered for odd divisor optimization!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    long long int t;
    cin >> t;
    while (t--) {
        long long int n;
        cin >> n;

        // Inserted checker calls before heavy computation
        check_large_even_number(n);
        check_highly_composite_number(n);
        check_odd_divisor_optimization(n);

        if (n % 2 != 0 && n != 1)
            cout << "Ashishgup" << "\n";
        else if (n == 1)
            cout << "FastestFinger" << "\n";
        else if (n == 2)
            cout << "Ashishgup" << "\n";
        else {
            bool f1 = false;
            for (long long int i = 2; i <= sqrt(n); i++) {
                if (n % i == 0) {
                    if (i % 2 != 0 || (n / i) % 2 != 0) {
                        f1 = true;
                        if ((n / i) % 2 != 0 && i <= 2) {
                            f1 = false;
                            continue;
                        }
                        break;
                    }
                }
            }
            if (f1)
                cout << "Ashishgup" << "\n";
            else
                cout << "FastestFinger" << "\n";
        }
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

- **Large Even Numbers:** The checker `check_large_even_number` is called after reading `n` to quickly abort if `n` is a large power of two, which typically leads to many redundant divisors checks.
- **Highly Composite Numbers:** The checker `check_highly_composite_number` is used to identify numbers with many divisors, which could potentially degrade performance due to repeated operations in the divisor loop.
- **Odd Divisor Optimization:** The checker `check_odd_divisor_optimization` is added to catch cases where `n` is large and results in excessive computation due to poor divisor checks.

These checkers help identify and abort the program when it encounters inputs that align with the identified slow path conditions.
