system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

Ashishgup and FastestFinger play a game. 

They start with a number n and play in turns. In each turn, a player can make any one of the following moves:

  * Divide n by any of its odd divisors greater than 1. 
  * Subtract 1 from n if n is greater than 1. 



Divisors of a number include the number itself.

The player who is unable to make a move loses the game.

Ashishgup moves first. Determine the winner of the game if both of them play optimally.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer — n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9).

Output

For each test case, print "Ashishgup" if he wins, and "FastestFinger" otherwise (without quotes).

Output


FastestFinger

FastestFinger
Ashishgup

Note

In the first test case, n = 1, Ashishgup cannot make a move. He loses.

In the second test case, n = 2, Ashishgup subtracts 1 on the first move. Now n = 1, FastestFinger cannot make a move, so he loses.

In the third test case, n = 3, Ashishgup divides by 3 on the first move. Now n = 1, FastestFinger cannot make a move, so he loses.

In the last test case, n = 12, Ashishgup divides it by 3. Now n = 4, FastestFinger is forced to subtract 1, and Ashishgup gets 3, so he wins by dividing it by 3.

(F) Program Solving the Problem Statement

#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    long long n;
    cin >> n;

    else if (n == 2)
      cout << "Ashishgup" << endl;
    else if (n % 2)
      cout << "Ashishgup" << endl;
    else {
      set<int> st;
      for (int i = 2; i * i <= n; i++) {
        if (n % i == 0) {
          if (i % 2) st.insert(i);
          if ((n / i) % 2) st.insert(n / i);
        }
      }
      if (st.size() == 0)
        cout << "FastestFinger" << endl;
      else {
        int f = 0;
        for (auto i : st) {
          if (i != n / 2) {
            cout << "Ashishgup" << endl;
            f = 1;
            break;
          }
        }
        if (f == 0) cout << "FastestFinger" << endl;
      }
    }

assistant: ### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

By comparing the line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs, we can identify which sections of the code are causing slow performance:

1. **Line 17 (`for` loop):** This loop iterates over potential divisors up to the square root of `n`. The slow input shows this line being hit 112,881 times compared to only 5 for the fast input. The number of iterations is significantly higher for larger values of `n`, especially when `n` is a large even number.

2. **Lines 18-20:** These lines are responsible for checking if `n` is divisible by `i` and if so, whether the divisor is odd. They contribute heavily to the hit count in the slow input, indicating that many divisors are being evaluated.

3. **Line 23:** This line checks if the set of odd divisors is empty. It is hit 28 times in the slow input but only twice in the fast input, suggesting the slow input often results in empty sets after the loop.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants (Natural Language)

Based on the analysis, we can derive the following performance-characterizing invariants:

1. **Invariant 1: High Number of Divisor Checks**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "If `n` is a large even number with few odd divisors, the program may slow down significantly due to excessive checks for divisors."
   - **Explanation:** When `n` is a large even number that lacks small odd divisors, the loop iterates over many potential divisors, resulting in a high number of operations before concluding there are no valid moves. This scenario is exacerbated when `n` is a power of two or a number without small odd divisors.

2. **Invariant 2: Repeated Set Operations**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "If the set of odd divisors grows large or if `n` is a product of a large even base and a small odd factor, performance may degrade due to repeated insertions and checks within the set."
   - **Explanation:** In cases where `n` can be expressed as a product of a large even base and small odd factors, the repeated insertion of divisors into the set can contribute to slower performance. This typically happens when iterating over all divisors.

3. **Invariant 3: Loop Overhead with Large `n`**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "The code may become slow if `n` has a large even factor, which leads to extensive iterations over potential divisors without finding odd ones."
   - **Explanation:** Large even factors mean that the loop must iterate through many numbers before finding an odd divisor, resulting in a high overhead due to loop execution.

These invariants highlight that the slowdown is primarily due to the computational cost of finding odd divisors in large even numbers, particularly when `n` is close to powers of two or large numbers without small odd divisors.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
Ashishgup and FastestFinger play a game. 

They start with a number n and play in turns. In each turn, a player can make any one of the following moves:

  * Divide n by any of its odd divisors greater than 1. 
  * Subtract 1 from n if n is greater than 1. 



Divisors of a number include the number itself.

The player who is unable to make a move loses the game.

Ashishgup moves first. Determine the winner of the game if both of them play optimally.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer — n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9).

Output

For each test case, print "Ashishgup" if he wins, and "FastestFinger" otherwise (without quotes).

Example

Input

1
2
3
4
5
6
12


Output


FastestFinger
Ashishgup
Ashishgup
FastestFinger
Ashishgup
FastestFinger
Ashishgup

Note

In the first test case, n = 1, Ashishgup cannot make a move. He loses.

In the second test case, n = 2, Ashishgup subtracts 1 on the first move. Now n = 1, FastestFinger cannot make a move, so he loses.

In the third test case, n = 3, Ashishgup divides by 3 on the first move. Now n = 1, FastestFinger cannot make a move, so he loses.

In the last test case, n = 12, Ashishgup divides it by 3. Now n = 4, FastestFinger is forced to subtract 1, and Ashishgup gets 3, so he wins by dividing it by 3.

Solution (C++ code):
{solution}


assistant: ### Phase 3: Implement the Natural Language Invariants in C++

Below are the C++ code snippets implementing the performance-characterizing invariants derived earlier:

```cpp
void check_high_divisor_checks(long long n) {
    // Check if n is a large even number (power of 2) and has few odd divisors
    if ((n & (n - 1)) == 0 && n > 2) { // Check if n is a power of 2
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high divisor checks for large even number!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_repeated_set_operations(long long n, const set<int>& st) {
    // Check if the set of odd divisors is non-empty and n is a product of a large even base and a small odd factor
    if (!st.empty() && n % 2 == 0 && n > 2 && (n / 2) % 2 == 0) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - repeated set operations for large even base!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_large_even_factor(long long n) {
    // Check if n has a large even factor leading to extensive iterations over potential divisors
    if ((n > 2) && (n % 2 == 0) && (n & (n - 1)) != 0) { // Ensure n is even but not a power of 2
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large even factor causing loop overhead!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrate the Checker Code into the Original Program

Below is the instrumented C++ code with the performance checkers integrated:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Checker functions for performance bottlenecks
void check_high_divisor_checks(long long n) {
    if ((n & (n - 1)) == 0 && n > 2) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high divisor checks for large even number!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

### Explanation of Code Integration

- **`check_high_divisor_checks`:** This check is placed right after reading the input for `n` to identify cases where `n` is a large power of two.
  
- **`check_repeated_set_operations`:** This check is inserted after the loop that calculates divisors and populates the set to detect heavy set operations.

- **`check_large_even_factor`:** This check is placed after all divisors are processed to catch cases where large even factors cause extensive loop overhead. 

By inserting these checks at specific points in the control flow, we ensure they help detect bottlenecks without adding overhead in critical loops.
