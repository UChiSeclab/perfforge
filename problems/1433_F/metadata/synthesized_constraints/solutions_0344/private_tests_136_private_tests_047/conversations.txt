system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

You are given a matrix a of size n × m consisting of integers.

You can choose no more than \left⌊m/2\right⌋ elements in each row. Your task is to choose these elements in such a way that their sum is divisible by k and this sum is the maximum.

In other words, you can choose no more than a half (rounded down) of elements in each row, you have to find the maximum sum of these elements divisible by k.

Note that you can choose zero elements (and the sum of such set is 0).

Input

The first line of the input contains three integers n, m and k (1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 70) — the number of rows in the matrix, the number of columns in the matrix and the value of k. The next n lines contain m elements each, where the j-th element of the i-th row is a_{i, j} (1 ≤ a_{i, j} ≤ 70).

Output

Print one integer — the maximum sum divisible by k you can obtain.

Examples

Note

In the first example, the optimal answer is 2 and 4 in the first row, 5 and 2 in the second row and 7 and 4 in the third row. The total sum is 2 + 4 + 5 + 2 + 7 + 4 = 24.

assistant: ### Performance Analysis and Invariants

**Phase 1: Identifying Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments**

Upon analyzing the provided code and hit counts, the following observations can be made:

1. **High Hit Counts in Nested Loops:**
   - The lines involving the `rowdp` array initialization (lines 55-58) and update (lines 67-69) have significantly more hits in the slow input case. Specifically, the nested loop iterating over `ii`, `jj`, and `kk` (lines 55-57) generates a vast number of operations due to its cubic nature.
   - The `amax` operations within various loops (lines 67, 69, 77, and 82) are executed very frequently in the slow scenario, indicating that the operations on the `rowdp` and `dp` arrays may be contributing heavily to the slowdown.

2. **Dominant Role of `rowdp` and `dp` Arrays:**
   - The initialization and usage of the `rowdp` array, especially with its three-dimensional nature, result in a high number of operations.
   - The `dp` array's two-dimensional updates and its interaction with `rowdp` (especially calculating `mxr` and `amax` updates) also show a high hit count difference.

3. **Matrix Dimensions and Constraints:**
   - Given that `n`, `m`, and `k` can all be as large as 70, the cubic loop structures (e.g., iterating up to 80 in the `rowdp` updates) can lead to a significant increase in operations when `n` and `m` approach their upper limits.

**Phase 2: Performance-Characterizing Invariants**

Based on the above analysis, several natural language performance-characterizing invariants can be derived:

1. **High Dimensional Operations:**
   - "If the number of rows \( n \) is large and the number of columns \( m \) is close to its upper limit, the code segments involving three-dimensional array updates become significant performance bottlenecks due to their cubic complexity."
   
2. **Row Selection Complexity:**
   - "When the matrix dimensions are large, the complexity of selecting elements such that their sum is divisible by \( k \) increases due to the need to frequently update and evaluate multiple states of the `rowdp` array."
   
3. **Frequent State Updates:**
   - "With large dimensions, the frequent updating and evaluation of possible sum states in `dp` and `rowdp` arrays contribute to performance degradation, particularly as \( k \) becomes large which increases the number of possible states for sum calculations."

4. **Matrix Size Thresholds:**
   - "If the effective matrix size (product of \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \)) approaches the volume handled by nested loops (for instance, around 70\*70\*70 operations), the performance may degrade due to the exponential increase in the number of operations required for updating and evaluating potential solutions."

These invariants abstract the conditions under which the program performance degrades and offers insights into potential triggers for slowdowns, particularly related to input dimensions and their interaction with array-based dynamic programming structures.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
You are given a matrix a of size n × m consisting of integers.

You can choose no more than \left⌊m/2\right⌋ elements in each row. Your task is to choose these elements in such a way that their sum is divisible by k and this sum is the maximum.

In other words, you can choose no more than a half (rounded down) of elements in each row, you have to find the maximum sum of these elements divisible by k.

Note that you can choose zero elements (and the sum of such set is 0).

Input

The first line of the input contains three integers n, m and k (1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 70) — the number of rows in the matrix, the number of columns in the matrix and the value of k. The next n lines contain m elements each, where the j-th element of the i-th row is a_{i, j} (1 ≤ a_{i, j} ≤ 70).

Output

Print one integer — the maximum sum divisible by k you can obtain.

Examples

Input


3 4 3
1 2 3 4
5 2 2 2
7 1 1 4


Output


24


Input


5 5 4
1 2 4 2 1
3 5 1 2 4
1 5 7 1 2
3 8 7 1 2
8 4 7 1 6


Output


56

Note

In the first example, the optimal answer is 2 and 4 in the first row, 5 and 2 in the second row and 7 and 4 in the third row. The total sum is 2 + 4 + 5 + 2 + 7 + 4 = 24.

Solution (C++ code):

assistant: ### Phase 3: Implementing Natural Language Invariants as Runtime Checks in C++

Below are the runtime checks implemented for the performance-characterizing invariants derived earlier:

```cpp
void check_high_dimensional_operations(long long n, long long m, long long k) {
    if (n > 60 && m > 60) { // Set a threshold close to the maximum constraints
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck triggered due to high dimensional operations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_row_selection_complexity(long long m, long long k) {
    if (m > 60 && k > 60) { // Checking if both m and k are large
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck triggered due to row selection complexity!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_frequent_state_updates(long long n, long long m, long long k) {
    if (n * m * k > 200000) { // Arbitrary threshold based on tested effective matrix size
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck triggered due to frequent state updates!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrating Checks into the Original C++ Program

Below is the instrumented C++ code with the necessary checks incorporated:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

template <typename T1, typename T2>
istream& operator>>(istream& in, pair<T1, T2>& a) {
    in >> a.first >> a.second;
    return in;
}

template <typename T1, typename T2>
ostream& operator<<(ostream& out, pair<T1, T2> a) {
    out << a.first << " " << a.second;
    return out;
}

template <typename T, typename T1>
T amax(T& a, T1 b) {
    if (b > a) a = b;
    return a;
}

    if (n > 60 && m > 60) { // Set a threshold close to the maximum constraints
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck triggered due to high dimensional operations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_row_selection_complexity(long long m, long long k) {
    if (m > 60 && k > 60) { // Checking if both m and k are large
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck triggered due to row selection complexity!" << endl;
        abort();
    }

    }
}

    long long n, m, k;
    cin >> n >> m >> k;

    // Place checks right after reading inputs

        }
    }
    dp[0][0] = 0;
    for (long long i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        for (long long ii = 0; ii < 80; ++ii) {
            for (long long jj = 0; jj < 80; ++jj) {

}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Check Placement:** The checks are placed immediately after reading the inputs, ensuring they run before any intensive operations start, thereby avoiding additional overhead in tight loops.

2. **Thresholds:** The thresholds used in the checks are close to the constraints' limits provided in the problem statement. This helps catch scenarios that are likely to cause performance issues without unnecessarily aborting reasonable runs.

3. **Abort on Bottlenecks:** Each check will output a warning and abort the program if a bottleneck condition is detected, helping identify performance issues during testing or debugging.
