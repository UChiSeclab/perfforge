### Performance Analysis and Invariants

**Phase 1: Identifying Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments**

Upon analyzing the provided code and hit counts, the following observations can be made:

1. **High Hit Counts in Nested Loops:**
   - The lines involving the `rowdp` array initialization (lines 55-58) and update (lines 67-69) have significantly more hits in the slow input case. Specifically, the nested loop iterating over `ii`, `jj`, and `kk` (lines 55-57) generates a vast number of operations due to its cubic nature.
   - The `amax` operations within various loops (lines 67, 69, 77, and 82) are executed very frequently in the slow scenario, indicating that the operations on the `rowdp` and `dp` arrays may be contributing heavily to the slowdown.

2. **Dominant Role of `rowdp` and `dp` Arrays:**
   - The initialization and usage of the `rowdp` array, especially with its three-dimensional nature, result in a high number of operations.
   - The `dp` array's two-dimensional updates and its interaction with `rowdp` (especially calculating `mxr` and `amax` updates) also show a high hit count difference.

3. **Matrix Dimensions and Constraints:**
   - Given that `n`, `m`, and `k` can all be as large as 70, the cubic loop structures (e.g., iterating up to 80 in the `rowdp` updates) can lead to a significant increase in operations when `n` and `m` approach their upper limits.

**Phase 2: Performance-Characterizing Invariants**

Based on the above analysis, several natural language performance-characterizing invariants can be derived:

1. **High Dimensional Operations:**
   - "If the number of rows \( n \) is large and the number of columns \( m \) is close to its upper limit, the code segments involving three-dimensional array updates become significant performance bottlenecks due to their cubic complexity."
   
2. **Row Selection Complexity:**
   - "When the matrix dimensions are large, the complexity of selecting elements such that their sum is divisible by \( k \) increases due to the need to frequently update and evaluate multiple states of the `rowdp` array."
   
3. **Frequent State Updates:**
   - "With large dimensions, the frequent updating and evaluation of possible sum states in `dp` and `rowdp` arrays contribute to performance degradation, particularly as \( k \) becomes large which increases the number of possible states for sum calculations."

4. **Matrix Size Thresholds:**
   - "If the effective matrix size (product of \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \)) approaches the volume handled by nested loops (for instance, around 70\*70\*70 operations), the performance may degrade due to the exponential increase in the number of operations required for updating and evaluating potential solutions."

These invariants abstract the conditions under which the program performance degrades and offers insights into potential triggers for slowdowns, particularly related to input dimensions and their interaction with array-based dynamic programming structures.

### Phase 3: Implementing Natural Language Invariants as Runtime Checks in C++

Below are the runtime checks implemented for the performance-characterizing invariants derived earlier:

```cpp
void check_high_dimensional_operations(long long n, long long m, long long k) {
    if (n > 60 && m > 60) { // Set a threshold close to the maximum constraints
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck triggered due to high dimensional operations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_row_selection_complexity(long long m, long long k) {
    if (m > 60 && k > 60) { // Checking if both m and k are large
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck triggered due to row selection complexity!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_frequent_state_updates(long long n, long long m, long long k) {
    if (n * m * k > 200000) { // Arbitrary threshold based on tested effective matrix size
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck triggered due to frequent state updates!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrating Checks into the Original C++ Program

Below is the instrumented C++ code with the necessary checks incorporated:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

template <typename T1, typename T2>
istream& operator>>(istream& in, pair<T1, T2>& a) {
    in >> a.first >> a.second;
    return in;
}

template <typename T1, typename T2>
ostream& operator<<(ostream& out, pair<T1, T2> a) {
    out << a.first << " " << a.second;
    return out;
}

template <typename T, typename T1>
T amax(T& a, T1 b) {
    if (b > a) a = b;
    return a;
}

    if (n > 60 && m > 60) { // Set a threshold close to the maximum constraints
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck triggered due to high dimensional operations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_row_selection_complexity(long long m, long long k) {
    if (m > 60 && k > 60) { // Checking if both m and k are large
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck triggered due to row selection complexity!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_frequent_state_updates(long long n, long long m, long long k) {
    if (n * m * k > 200000) { // Arbitrary threshold based on tested effective matrix size
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck triggered due to frequent state updates!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void solve() {
    long long n, m, k;
    cin >> n >> m >> k;

    // Place checks right after reading inputs
    check_high_dimensional_operations(n, m, k);
    check_row_selection_complexity(m, k);
    check_frequent_state_updates(n, m, k);

        }
    }
    dp[0][0] = 0;
    for (long long i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        for (long long ii = 0; ii < 80; ++ii) {
            for (long long jj = 0; jj < 80; ++jj) {
                for (long long kk = 0; kk < 80; ++kk) {

                    amax(rowdp[j + 1][c][r], rowdp[j][c][r]);
                }
            }
        }

    }

}

signed main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);

}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Check Placement:** The checks are placed immediately after reading the inputs, ensuring they run before any intensive operations start, thereby avoiding additional overhead in tight loops.

2. **Thresholds:** The thresholds used in the checks are close to the constraints' limits provided in the problem statement. This helps catch scenarios that are likely to cause performance issues without unnecessarily aborting reasonable runs.

3. **Abort on Bottlenecks:** Each check will output a warning and abort the program if a bottleneck condition is detected, helping identify performance issues during testing or debugging.
