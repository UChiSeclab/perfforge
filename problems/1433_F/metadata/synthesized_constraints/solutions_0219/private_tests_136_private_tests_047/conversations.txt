system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

You are given a matrix a of size n × m consisting of integers.

You can choose no more than \left⌊m/2\right⌋ elements in each row. Your task is to choose these elements in such a way that their sum is divisible by k and this sum is the maximum.

In other words, you can choose no more than a half (rounded down) of elements in each row, you have to find the maximum sum of these elements divisible by k.

Note that you can choose zero elements (and the sum of such set is 0).

Input

The first line of the input contains three integers n, m and k (1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 70) — the number of rows in the matrix, the number of columns in the matrix and the value of k. The next n lines contain m elements each, where the j-th element of the i-th row is a_{i, j} (1 ≤ a_{i, j} ≤ 70).

Output

Print one integer — the maximum sum divisible by k you can obtain.

Examples

56

Note

In the first example, the optimal answer is 2 and 4 in the first row, 5 and 2 in the second row and 7 and 4 in the third row. The total sum is 2 + 4 + 5 + 2 + 7 + 4 = 24.

assistant: Let's proceed with the analysis of the provided code and derive performance-characterizing invariants.

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Comparing Line-Level Hit Counts:**
   - The slow input causes significantly more hits on the inner loops, especially lines 67, 68, 73, and 77, indicating that these loops are being executed far more often compared to the fast input.

2. **Pinpointed Hotspots:**
   - **Lines 67-77:** These lines are within a nested loop iterating over a large range (4901). Specifically:
     - Line 67: The outermost loop iterates over the 4901 possible subset sums.
     - Lines 68-70: Check conditions and update temporary arrays.
     - Line 73-77: Again iterate over 4901 possibilities to update the `subset_sums` and `counts` arrays.

3. **Inference:**
   - The significant difference in hit counts suggests that `subset_sums` and `counts` arrays are being processed extensively for the slow input. This extensive processing is due to looping over possible subset sums up to 4901, a large number that results in a considerable computational load.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the above analysis, here are the performance-characterizing invariants:

1. **Invariant 1: Large Search Space in Subset Sum Calculation**
   - **Natural Language Statement:** If the number of rows `n` is large and each column element is small (leading to many equivalent sums), then the subset sum computations may engage more iterations and checks, causing slowdowns. This happens because many equivalent sums are possible, exacerbating the processing within the loop.
   
2. **Invariant 2: High Redundancy in Count Updates**
   - **Natural Language Statement:** When the elements of the matrix are similar or identical, the internal loop updating `counts` redundantly processes similar states, leading to inefficient usage of time in dynamic programming state transitions. This is especially costly when `n` is near the upper limit (70), and `m` is small, causing repetitive conditional checks.

3. **Invariant 3: Extensive Iteration on Large State Spaces**
   - **Natural Language Statement:** If `n` and the given divisor `k` are both large, the iterative process in determining valid mod values spans a larger computation space, leading to performance bottlenecks due to increased iteration for computing maximum sums.

By keeping these conditions in mind, you can anticipate which scenarios are likely to lead to performance issues, and potentially target them for optimization or further testing.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
You are given a matrix a of size n × m consisting of integers.

You can choose no more than \left⌊m/2\right⌋ elements in each row. Your task is to choose these elements in such a way that their sum is divisible by k and this sum is the maximum.

In other words, you can choose no more than a half (rounded down) of elements in each row, you have to find the maximum sum of these elements divisible by k.

Note that you can choose zero elements (and the sum of such set is 0).

Input

The first line of the input contains three integers n, m and k (1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 70) — the number of rows in the matrix, the number of columns in the matrix and the value of k. The next n lines contain m elements each, where the j-th element of the i-th row is a_{i, j} (1 ≤ a_{i, j} ≤ 70).

Output

Print one integer — the maximum sum divisible by k you can obtain.

Examples

Input


3 4 3
1 2 3 4
5 2 2 2
7 1 1 4


Output


24


Input


5 5 4
1 2 4 2 1
3 5 1 2 4
1 5 7 1 2
3 8 7 1 2
8 4 7 1 6


Output


56

Note

In the first example, the optimal answer is 2 and 4 in the first row, 5 and 2 in the second row and 7 and 4 in the third row. The total sum is 2 + 4 + 5 + 2 + 7 + 4 = 24.

Solution (C++ code):
{solution}


assistant: ### Phase 3: Implement the Natural Language Invariants in C++

Let's translate the previously identified performance-characterizing invariants into runtime checks in C++. We will create helper functions for each invariant.

```cpp
// Check for large search space in subset sum calculation
void check_large_search_space(int n, int m, const vector<vector<int>> &matrix) {
    int similar_count = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        set<int> unique_elements(matrix[i].begin(), matrix[i].end());
        if (unique_elements.size() == 1) {
            ++similar_count;
        }
    }
    if (similar_count > n / 2) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large search space due to similar elements." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Check for high redundancy in count updates
void check_redundant_updates(int n, int m, const vector<vector<bool>> &subset_sums) {
    if (n > 60 && m < 10) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high redundancy in count updates." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Check for extensive iteration on large state spaces
void check_large_state_space(int n, int k) {
    if (n > 60 && k > 60) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - extensive iteration on large state spaces." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrate Checker Functions into the Original Program

Now, let's integrate these checkers into the provided C++ program, placing them at strategic points to ensure they provide warning messages if the performance-characterizing conditions are met.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
const long long mod = 1000000007;
const long long infinity = 1000000000000000000;
bool do_debug = false;

// Check for large search space in subset sum calculation
void check_large_search_space(int n, int m, const vector<vector<int>> &matrix) {
    int similar_count = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        set<int> unique_elements(matrix[i].begin(), matrix[i].end());
        if (unique_elements.size() == 1) {
            ++similar_count;
        }
    }
    if (similar_count > n / 2) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large search space due to similar elements." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Check for high redundancy in count updates
void check_redundant_updates(int n, int m, const vector<vector<bool>> &subset_sums) {
    if (n > 60 && m < 10) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high redundancy in count updates." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Check for extensive iteration on large state spaces
void check_large_state_space(int n, int k) {
    if (n > 60 && k > 60) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - extensive iteration on large state spaces." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void solve() {
    int nr, nc, div;
    cin >> nr >> nc >> div;
    int lim = nc / 2;
    vector<vector<int>> v(nr, vector<int>(nc));

    }

    // Check for performance bottlenecks
    check_large_search_space(nr, nc, v);
    check_large_state_space(nr, div);

    for (long long i = 0; i < nr; i++) {
        subset_sums[i][0] = true;
        counts = vector<int>(4901, 1000);
        counts[0] = 0;
        for (long long j = 0; j < nc; j++) {
            vector<bool> updated_subset_sums(4901, false);
            vector<int> updated_counts(4901, 1000);

                if (updated_subset_sums[k]) {
                    subset_sums[i][k] = true;
                }
                counts[k] = min(counts[k], updated_counts[k]);
            }
        }
        for (long long k = 0; k < 4901; k++) {
            if (subset_sums[i][k]) {
                mod_values[i][k % div] = max(mod_values[i][k % div], (int)k);

    }

                    int x = (j + k) % div;
                    dp[i][x] = max(dp[i][x], mod_values[i][j] + dp[i - 1][k]);
                } else if (dp[i - 1][k] != -1) {
                    int x = k;
                    dp[i][x] = max(dp[i][x], dp[i - 1][k]);
                } else if (mod_values[i][j] != -1) {
                    int x = j;
                    dp[i][x] = max(dp[i][x], mod_values[i][j]);
                }
            }
        }
    }
    cout << dp[nr - 1][0] << "\n";
}

int main() {

```

### Explanation:
- **Invariant 1:** `check_large_search_space` checks if more than half of the rows contain identical elements, which can lead to a large search space.
- **Invariant 2:** `check_redundant_updates` checks for scenarios where `n` is large and `m` is small, indicating potential redundancy in updates.
- **Invariant 3:** `check_large_state_space` checks if both `n` and `k` are large, suggesting significant iteration over a large state space.

These checks are placed before the heavy computational sections to avoid introducing additional overhead during the critical operations.
