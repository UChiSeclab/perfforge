system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

You are playing a computer game, where you lead a party of m soldiers. Each soldier is characterised by his agility a_i.

The level you are trying to get through can be represented as a straight line segment from point 0 (where you and your squad is initially located) to point n + 1 (where the boss is located).

The level is filled with k traps. Each trap is represented by three numbers l_i, r_i and d_i. l_i is the location of the trap, and d_i is the danger level of the trap: whenever a soldier with agility lower than d_i steps on a trap (that is, moves to the point l_i), he gets instantly killed. Fortunately, you can disarm traps: if you move to the point r_i, you disarm this trap, and it no longer poses any danger to your soldiers. Traps don't affect you, only your soldiers.

You have t seconds to complete the level — that is, to bring some soldiers from your squad to the boss. Before the level starts, you choose which soldiers will be coming with you, and which soldiers won't be. After that, you have to bring all of the chosen soldiers to the boss. To do so, you may perform the following actions:

  * if your location is x, you may move to x + 1 or x - 1. This action consumes one second; 
  * if your location is x and the location of your squad is x, you may move to x + 1 or to x - 1 with your squad in one second. You may not perform this action if it puts some soldier in danger (i. e. the point your squad is moving into contains a non-disarmed trap with d_i greater than agility of some soldier from the squad). This action consumes one second; 
  * if your location is x and there is a trap i with r_i = x, you may disarm this trap. This action is done instantly (it consumes no time). 



Note that after each action both your coordinate and the coordinate of your squad should be integers.

You have to choose the maximum number of soldiers such that they all can be brought from the point 0 to the point n + 1 (where the boss waits) in no more than t seconds.

Input

The first line contains four integers m, n, k and t (1 ≤ m, n, k, t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, n < t) — the number of soldiers, the number of integer points between the squad and the boss, the number of traps and the maximum number of seconds you may spend to bring the squad to the boss, respectively.

The second line contains m integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_m (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5), where a_i is the agility of the i-th soldier.

Then k lines follow, containing the descriptions of traps. Each line contains three numbers l_i, r_i and d_i (1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n, 1 ≤ d_i ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) — the location of the trap, the location where the trap can be disarmed, and its danger level, respectively.

Output

Print one integer — the maximum number of soldiers you may choose so that you may bring them all to the boss in no more than t seconds.

Example

Input


5 6 4 14
1 2 3 4 5
1 5 2
1 2 5
2 3 5
3 5 3


Output


3

Note

In the first example you may take soldiers with agility 3, 4 and 5 with you. The course of action is as follows:

  * go to 2 without your squad; 
  * disarm the trap 2; 
  * go to 3 without your squad; 
  * disartm the trap 3; 
  * go to 0 without your squad; 
  * go to 7 with your squad. 



The whole plan can be executed in 13 seconds.

assistant: To determine why the given C program slows down for the slow input, we need to analyze the hit counts and understand how the code interacts with data structures and control flow. The provided solution involves checking the maximum number of soldiers who can reach the boss within a given time constraint, avoiding traps that can be disarmed. 

Here is an analysis based on the hit counts and the algorithm's logic:

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **High Hit Counts:** The line `while (indurance >= traps[i].first) i++;` in the `pass` function has significantly higher hit counts in the slow input (200023) compared to the fast input (12). This suggests that the loop is running many more iterations for the slow input.

2. **Function Purpose:** This loop appears to identify the starting point for traps that have a danger level greater than the current endurance. The binary search (BS) function seems to adjust the number of soldiers by checking if they can pass the traps within the time limit using the `pass` function.

3. **Data Structure and Control Flow:** The loop iterates over the traps until it finds one that the current soldier (or soldiers with the lowest agility yet being considered) cannot endure. This is a linear scan through the traps array and is likely the root cause of the slowdown due to the increased number of iterations.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the hit counts and code analysis, we can derive the following performance-characterizing invariants:

1. **Invariant 1:** "When the number of traps with a danger level less than or equal to the least agile soldier being considered is large, the loop that iterates over these traps becomes time-consuming, causing a slowdown. This is particularly noticeable when such traps constitute the majority of the traps array."

2. **Invariant 2:** "If the array of soldiers' agility is sorted such that many soldiers have similar low agility, the algorithm may repeatedly scan many traps unnecessarily in the linear search part of the `pass` function. This can lead to inefficiencies when the number of such traps is large."

3. **Invariant 3:** "The performance may degrade when many traps are concentrated in a region where their danger levels vary around the endurance threshold of the current soldier being considered, requiring frequent checks against each trap."

These invariants focus on situations where unnecessary linear searches are performed due to the arrangement of soldiers (low agility) and traps (many traps with danger levels at or below current endurance). The conditions strongly correlate with the observed slow path in the `pass` function loop iterations.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
You are playing a computer game, where you lead a party of m soldiers. Each soldier is characterised by his agility a_i.

The level you are trying to get through can be represented as a straight line segment from point 0 (where you and your squad is initially located) to point n + 1 (where the boss is located).

The level is filled with k traps. Each trap is represented by three numbers l_i, r_i and d_i. l_i is the location of the trap, and d_i is the danger level of the trap: whenever a soldier with agility lower than d_i steps on a trap (that is, moves to the point l_i), he gets instantly killed. Fortunately, you can disarm traps: if you move to the point r_i, you disarm this trap, and it no longer poses any danger to your soldiers. Traps don't affect you, only your soldiers.

You have t seconds to complete the level — that is, to bring some soldiers from your squad to the boss. Before the level starts, you choose which soldiers will be coming with you, and which soldiers won't be. After that, you have to bring all of the chosen soldiers to the boss. To do so, you may perform the following actions:

  * if your location is x, you may move to x + 1 or x - 1. This action consumes one second; 
  * if your location is x and the location of your squad is x, you may move to x + 1 or to x - 1 with your squad in one second. You may not perform this action if it puts some soldier in danger (i. e. the point your squad is moving into contains a non-disarmed trap with d_i greater than agility of some soldier from the squad). This action consumes one second; 
  * if your location is x and there is a trap i with r_i = x, you may disarm this trap. This action is done instantly (it consumes no time). 



Note that after each action both your coordinate and the coordinate of your squad should be integers.

You have to choose the maximum number of soldiers such that they all can be brought from the point 0 to the point n + 1 (where the boss waits) in no more than t seconds.

Input

The first line contains four integers m, n, k and t (1 ≤ m, n, k, t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, n < t) — the number of soldiers, the number of integer points between the squad and the boss, the number of traps and the maximum number of seconds you may spend to bring the squad to the boss, respectively.

The second line contains m integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_m (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5), where a_i is the agility of the i-th soldier.

Then k lines follow, containing the descriptions of traps. Each line contains three numbers l_i, r_i and d_i (1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n, 1 ≤ d_i ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) — the location of the trap, the location where the trap can be disarmed, and its danger level, respectively.

Output

Print one integer — the maximum number of soldiers you may choose so that you may bring them all to the boss in no more than t seconds.

Example

Input


5 6 4 14
1 2 3 4 5
1 5 2
1 2 5
2 3 5
3 5 3


Output


3

Note

In the first example you may take soldiers with agility 3, 4 and 5 with you. The course of action is as follows:

  * go to 2 without your squad; 
  * disarm the trap 2; 
  * go to 3 without your squad; 
  * disartm the trap 3; 
  * go to 0 without your squad; 
  * go to 7 with your squad. 



The whole plan can be executed in 13 seconds.

assistant: To implement the performance-characterizing invariants identified in the previous phase, we will translate each into C++ code. This code will check for the identified conditions that may lead to slow execution.

### Phase 3: Implementing the Invariants as C++ Checks

**Invariant 1:** When the number of traps with a danger level less than or equal to the least agile soldier being considered is large, the loop becomes time-consuming.

```cpp
void check_traps_invariant(int indurance, int k, const pair<int, pair<int, int>> traps[], int maxThreshold) {
    int count = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < k; ++i) {
        if (indurance >= traps[i].first) {
            ++count;
        }
    }
    if (count > maxThreshold) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - too many traps with danger level <= indurance." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

**Invariant 2:** If the array of soldiers' agility is sorted such that many soldiers have similar low agility, the algorithm may repeatedly scan many traps unnecessarily.

```cpp
void check_soldiers_agility_invariant(int m, const int sold[], int threshold) {
    for (int i = 0; i < m - 1; ++i) {
        if (sold[i] == sold[i + 1] && sold[i] < threshold) {
            cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - many soldiers with low, similar agility." << endl;
            abort();
        }
    }
}
```

**Invariant 3:** Performance may degrade when many traps are concentrated in a region where their danger levels vary around the endurance threshold.

```cpp
void check_trap_concentration_invariant(int k, const pair<int, pair<int, int>> traps[], int indurance, int regionThreshold) {
    int concentration = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < k; ++i) {
        if (traps[i].first <= indurance && traps[i].second.first >= indurance) {
            ++concentration;
        }
    }
    if (concentration > regionThreshold) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high concentration of traps near endurance threshold." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrating the Checks into the C++ Program

Let's integrate these checks into the original C++ program. These checks are placed at strategic points to ensure they do not add overhead within tight loops.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int sold[200005];
int m, n, k, t;
pair<int, pair<int, int>> traps[200005];

// Invariant checks
void check_traps_invariant(int indurance, int k, const pair<int, pair<int, int>> traps[], int maxThreshold) {
    int count = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < k; ++i) {
        if (indurance >= traps[i].first) {
            ++count;
        }
    }
    if (count > maxThreshold) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - too many traps with danger level <= indurance." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_soldiers_agility_invariant(int m, const int sold[], int threshold) {
    for (int i = 0; i < m - 1; ++i) {
        if (sold[i] == sold[i + 1] && sold[i] < threshold) {
            cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - many soldiers with low, similar agility." << endl;
            abort();
        }
    }
}

void check_trap_concentration_invariant(int k, const pair<int, pair<int, int>> traps[], int indurance, int regionThreshold) {
    int concentration = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < k; ++i) {
        if (traps[i].first <= indurance && traps[i].second.first >= indurance) {
            ++concentration;
        }
    }
    if (concentration > regionThreshold) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high concentration of traps near endurance threshold." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

bool pass(int indurance) {
    vector<pair<int, int>> leftTraps;
    int i = 0;
    while (indurance >= traps[i].first) i++;
    int j = i;
    while (j < k) leftTraps.push_back(traps[j++].second);
    sort(leftTraps.begin(), leftTraps.end());
    int l = leftTraps.size();
    int total_time = 0;
    int last = -1;
    i = 0;
    while (i < l) {
        j = i + 1;
        int firstPos = leftTraps[i].first;
        int maxWantedPos = leftTraps[i].second;
        while (leftTraps[j].first <= maxWantedPos && j < l) {
            maxWantedPos = max(maxWantedPos, leftTraps[j].second);
            j++;
        }
        total_time += 2 * (maxWantedPos - firstPos + 1);
        i = j;
    }
    return (n + 1 + total_time <= t);
}

int BS() {
    int e = m - 1, s = 0, mid;
    while (e > s + 1) {
        mid = (e + s) / 2;
        if (pass(sold[mid]))
            e = mid;
        else
            s = mid + 1;
    }
    while (pass(sold[e - 1]) && e >= 1) e--;
    if (!pass(sold[e])) return m;
    return e;
}

int main() {
    cin >> m >> n >> k >> t;
    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) cin >> sold[i];
    sort(sold, sold + m);
    
    // Check soldiers' agility invariant after sorting the soldiers.
    check_soldiers_agility_invariant(m, sold, 1000); // Example threshold value.

    for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
        int l, r, d;
        cin >> l >> r >> d;
        pair<int, int> z = make_pair(l, r);
        traps[i] = make_pair(d, z);
    }
    sort(traps, traps + k);

    int x = BS();
    cout << m - x << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

These invariant checks will help identify potential bottlenecks during execution, aiding in performance analysis and optimization. The thresholds for each invariant can be adjusted based on further profiling and testing.
