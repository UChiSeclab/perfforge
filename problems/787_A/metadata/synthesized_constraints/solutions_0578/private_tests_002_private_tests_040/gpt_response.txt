=== Invariants Response ===
To analyze the given C program and identify performance bottlenecks, let's proceed with the two phases as specified.

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Compare Line-Level Hit Counts:**
   - The outer loop (`for (long long i = 0; i <= 1e4; i++)`) is executed 10,002 times for the slow input and only once for the fast input.
   - The inner loop (`for (long long j = 0; j <= 1e4; j++)`) is executed 100,030,002 times for the slow input and only once for the fast input.
   - The condition (`if (b + a * i == d + c * j)`) inside the inner loop is evaluated 100,020,001 times for the slow input and only once for the fast input.

2. **Pinpoint Significant Lines/Functions:**
   - The main source of inefficiency comes from the nested loops, particularly because the condition to break out of the loops is never met for the slow input.
   - The double loop iterates over a large range (up to 10,000 for both `i` and `j`), leading to potentially 100 million iterations in the worst case.

3. **Inference:**
   - The slow input leads to exhaustive iteration because the termination condition (`b + a * i == d + c * j`) is never satisfied within the given limits.
   - This exhaustive search is inherently inefficient for cases where `b + a * i` and `d + c * j` do not align early.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

**Invariant 1: Nested Loop Exhaustion**
- **Natural Language Description:** When the sequences generated by the parameters `(a, b)` and `(c, d)` do not intersect within the given loop bounds, the loops will exhaustively explore all possible combinations, leading to significant slowdowns.
- **Condition Example:** If the arithmetic progressions defined by `b + a * i` and `d + c * j` do not have a common element within the first few iterations, the computation becomes expensive due to the high iteration count.

**Invariant 2: Symmetrical Sequences with Large Search Space**
- **Natural Language Description:** When both sequences have the same increment (`a == c`) but start at different positions (`b != d`), the sequences might never intersect, causing the loops to run until exhaustion.
- **Condition Example:** If `a == c` and `b % a != d % a`, the sequences will not intersect, leading to a full exploration of the search space, which is inefficient for larger `a` values.

**Invariant 3: Large Step Sizes with No Early Intersection**
- **Natural Language Description:** If the step size (`a` or `c`) is large and the starting points (`b` and `d`) are significantly different, it may take many iterations before an intersection is found, if at all.
- **Condition Example:** If `a` and `c` are close to their maximum values (100), and the sequences differ in starting points such that `(b - d) % gcd(a, c) != 0`, the loops explore extensively before concluding.

These invariants describe conditions that lead to performance degradation, helping pinpoint scenarios where the code is likely to slow down significantly given particular patterns in its input values.

=== Checker Response ===
Let's proceed with Phase 3, where we translate the natural language performance-characterizing invariants into C++ code for runtime checks.

### Phase 3: Implementing the Invariants as C++ Checkers

Here are the C++ snippets for the invariants identified in Phase 2:

1. **Invariant 1: Nested Loop Exhaustion**
   - Detects when the arithmetic progressions do not intersect early, leading to full loop exploration.
   
```cpp
void check_exhaustive_iteration_invariant(long long a, long long b, long long c, long long d) {
    if ((b - d) % std::gcd(a, c) != 0) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - exhaustive loop iteration!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

2. **Invariant 2: Symmetrical Sequences with Large Search Space**
   - Checks if sequences with the same increment but different starting points will never intersect.
   
```cpp
void check_symmetrical_sequences_invariant(long long a, long long b, long long c, long long d) {
    if (a == c && (b % a != d % a)) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - symmetrical sequences non-intersecting!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

3. **Invariant 3: Large Step Sizes with No Early Intersection**
   - Assesses large step sizes and significant starting point differences for potential high iteration counts.
   
```cpp
void check_large_step_sizes_invariant(long long a, long long b, long long c, long long d) {
    if ((a > 50 || c > 50) && (b - d) % std::gcd(a, c) != 0) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large step sizes with no intersection!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

Now that the checkers are defined, let's move to Phase 4, where these will be integrated into the original C++ code.

### Phase 4: Integrating the Checkers into the Program

Here is the original C++ code with the performance checkers integrated at appropriate positions:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Checker functions
void check_exhaustive_iteration_invariant(long long a, long long b, long long c, long long d) {
    if ((b - d) % std::gcd(a, c) != 0) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - exhaustive loop iteration!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_symmetrical_sequences_invariant(long long a, long long b, long long c, long long d) {
    if (a == c && (b % a != d % a)) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - symmetrical sequences non-intersecting!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_large_step_sizes_invariant(long long a, long long b, long long c, long long d) {
    if ((a > 50 || c > 50) && (b - d) % std::gcd(a, c) != 0) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large step sizes with no intersection!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    long long a, b;
    cin >> a >> b;
    long long c, d;
    cin >> c >> d;

    // Insert checks after reading inputs
    check_exhaustive_iteration_invariant(a, b, c, d);
    check_symmetrical_sequences_invariant(a, b, c, d);
    check_large_step_sizes_invariant(a, b, c, d);

    for (long long i = 0; i <= 1e4; i++) {
        for (long long j = 0; j <= 1e4; j++) {
            if (b + a * i == d + c * j) {
                cout << b + a * i << "\n";
                return 0;
            }
        }
    }
    cout << -1 << "\n";
}
```

### Explanation of Inserted Checks:
- The checker functions are called immediately after reading the inputs. This ensures that they assess potential performance bottlenecks early, avoiding unnecessary iterations if problematic conditions are detected.
- Each checker corresponds to one of the performance-characterizing invariants derived earlier, ensuring the program terminates with a warning if those conditions are met. This helps prevent running into slow path scenarios, especially valuable for fuzz testing or debugging.
