=== Invariants Response ===
### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

Upon analyzing the hit counts, we see the following:

1. **Loop Execution (Lines 21-31):** The loop is executed 100,000,000 times in the slow run but only 2 times in the fast run. This is a significant difference and likely the source of inefficiency.

2. **Conditional Checks (Lines 22-27):** Within the loop, checks and calculations are performed to determine if both `val1` and `val2` fit the criteria. These lines have the same hit counts as the loop, indicating they are evaluated every loop iteration.

The performance bottleneck is centered around the loop, which iterates over a large range of numbers, repeatedly checking conditions for each iteration.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the observations, we can make the following statements about when the program may experience slowdowns:

1. **Invariant #1 - Loop Range and Step Sizes:**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "If the step sizes `a` and `c` are both small and the initial offsets `b` and `d` are close, the loop will iterate a large number of times to find a meeting point, potentially leading to a slowdown."
   - **Explanation:** When the intervals between screams are small relative to the starting points, many iterations will occur before a common time is found, particularly problematic given high upper bounds for the loop (up to 100,000,000).

2. **Invariant #2 - Similar Step Sizes:**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "If `a` and `c` have a common divisor that is greater than 1, it increases the chance of many iterations as the periods of screams align less frequently. This scenario can trigger long search times to find a common scream time."
   - **Explanation:** A common divisor can result in fewer shared scream times within a given range, contributing to lengthy loop execution.

3. **Invariant #3 - Offset Alignment:**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "If the initial offsets `b` and `d` align in such a way that their respective sequences alternate without intersecting, the program will loop extensively without finding a common scream time."
   - **Explanation:** When offsets create alternation without intersection, the loop continues to its maximum range without success, leading to inefficiency.

These invariants help capture scenarios where the program might encounter performance issues due to input characteristics, without relying on specific input values.

=== Checker Response ===
### Phase 3: Implement the Natural Language Invariants in C++

Here are the invariant checks implemented in C++:

```cpp
void check_loop_range_and_step_sizes(int a, int c, int b, int d) {
    if (a <= 5 && c <= 5 && abs(b - d) <= 10) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to small step sizes and close offsets!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_common_divisor(int a, int c) {
    int gcd = std::__gcd(a, c);
    if (gcd > 1) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to common divisor of step sizes!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_offset_alignment(int b, int d) {
    if ((b % 2 == d % 2) && ((b / 2) % 2 == (d / 2) % 2)) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to aligned offsets causing alternating screams!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrate the Checker Code into the Original Program

Below is the original C++ code, instrumented with the invariant checks:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

void check_loop_range_and_step_sizes(int a, int c, int b, int d) {
    if (a <= 5 && c <= 5 && abs(b - d) <= 10) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to small step sizes and close offsets!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_common_divisor(int a, int c) {
    int gcd = std::__gcd(a, c);
    if (gcd > 1) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to common divisor of step sizes!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_offset_alignment(int b, int d) {
    if ((b % 2 == d % 2) && ((b / 2) % 2 == (d / 2) % 2)) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to aligned offsets causing alternating screams!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int a, b, c, d;

int main() {
    int i;
    scanf("%d %d", &a, &b);
    scanf("%d %d", &c, &d);

    // Inserted checks to detect performance bottlenecks
    check_loop_range_and_step_sizes(a, c, b, d);
    check_common_divisor(a, c);
    check_offset_alignment(b, d);

    int ret = -1;
    int mn = max(b, d);
    for (i = mn; i <= 100000000; i++) {
        int ok = 0;
        int val1 = i - b;
        if (val1 % a == 0) ok++;
        int val2 = i - d;
        if (val2 % c == 0) ok++;
        if (ok == 2) {
            ret = i;
            break;
        }
    }
    printf("%d", ret);
    printf("\n");
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

- **`check_loop_range_and_step_sizes`:** This function checks if both step sizes `a` and `c` are small and the initial offsets `b` and `d` are close, which could lead to many iterations of the loop.
- **`check_common_divisor`:** This function checks if `a` and `c` have a common divisor greater than 1, which could lead to fewer intersecting scream times.
- **`check_offset_alignment`:** This function checks if the initial offsets `b` and `d` align in a way that causes alternating scream times without intersection.

These checks are placed after reading the input data but before the main loop to preemptively catch conditions that might lead to performance bottlenecks.
