### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Line-Level Hit Count Analysis**: The main loop in the code (line 7) is executed 100,000,001 times for the slow input, while it only runs 3 times for the fast input. The primary reason for the slowdown is the inefficient iteration over the time steps when checking for simultaneous screams.
   
2. **Loop and Condition Analysis**:
   - Lines 8-14 are heavily hit during the slow run, indicating that these condition checks and increments are executed repeatedly.
   - The checks `b + a * x == d + c * y`, `b + a * x > d + c * y`, and `b + a * x < d + c * y` determine the path through the loop, where increments to `x` or `y` are made based on these comparisons.
   
3. **Interaction with Data Structures**: There are no explicit data structures used apart from the integer variables. However, the logic depends on calculating and comparing terms `b + a * x` and `d + c * y`, which are effectively generating sequences of scream times for Rick and Morty.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **Invariant 1: Large Iteration Limit**:
   - **Natural Language**: "If both intervals `a` and `c` are small, the program may spend excessive time iterating over potential scream times without finding a match, as the algorithm effectively performs a brute force search."
   - **Explanation**: Small values for `a` and `c` imply very frequent scream timings, thus requiring many comparisons before either a match is found or the loop terminates after exhausting the iteration limit.

2. **Invariant 2: Equal Intervals**:
   - **Natural Language**: "If `a` equals `c`, the periods of screaming align perfectly, causing the program to iterate through all possible time steps without finding a matching scream time, leading to a long execution time."
   - **Explanation**: When `a` and `c` are equal, the sequences align such that each increment only moves both scream times forward by the same amount, making it impossible to find a common time unless `b` equals `d`.

3. **Invariant 3: Similar Start Times**:
   - **Natural Language**: "If the initial scream times `b` and `d` are such that they differ by a small integer that is not a multiple of the difference between `a` and `c`, the loop will perform extensive iterations to find a simultaneous scream time or decide on no match."
   - **Explanation**: The initial offset between scream sequences combined with the differences in intervals affects how quickly (or if) the sequences can synchronize.

### Conclusion

The inefficiency in the given C program largely stems from the brute force method of comparing scream times using simple increment operations, which becomes particularly costly when the intervals `a` and `c` are small or equal, and the initial offsets `b` and `d` are not aligned in a way that allows for quick synchronization. These performance-characterizing invariants serve as guidelines for testing, indicating scenarios where the program is likely to experience significant slowdowns.

### Phase 3: Implement the Natural Language Invariants in C++

Let's convert the performance-characterizing invariants into C++ code that checks these conditions. Here are the implementations for each invariant derived earlier.

1. **Invariant Check for Small Intervals**:
   - This checker will warn if both `a` and `c` are small, as this can lead to excessive iterations.

    ```cpp
    void check_small_intervals(int a, int c) {
        if (a <= 5 && c <= 5) {  // Threshold chosen based on typical small values
            cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to small intervals!" << endl;
            abort();
        }
    }
    ```

2. **Invariant Check for Equal Intervals**:
   - This checker will warn if `a` equals `c`, which could cause perpetual looping without synchronization unless initial conditions are perfectly aligned.

    ```cpp
    void check_equal_intervals(int a, int c) {
        if (a == c) {
            cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to equal intervals!" << endl;
            abort();
        }
    }
    ```

3. **Invariant Check for Small Initial Offset**:
   - This checker will warn if the initial times `b` and `d` differ by a small value that is not aligned with `a` and `c`.

    ```cpp
    void check_small_initial_offset(int b, int d, int a, int c) {
        if (abs(b - d) <= 5 && a != c) {  // Small offset threshold with intervals not aligned
            cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to small initial offset!" << endl;
            abort();
        }
    }
    ```

### Phase 4: Integrate the Checker Code into the Original Program

Now, let's integrate these checkers into the original C++ code. We place these checks at appropriate points to avoid overhead in tight loops.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Checkers
void check_small_intervals(int a, int c) {
    if (a <= 5 && c <= 5) {  // Threshold chosen based on typical small values
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to small intervals!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_equal_intervals(int a, int c) {
    if (a == c) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to equal intervals!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_small_initial_offset(int b, int d, int a, int c) {
    if (abs(b - d) <= 5 && a != c) {  // Small offset threshold with intervals not aligned
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to small initial offset!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    int a, b, c, d;
    cin >> a >> b >> c >> d;

    // Place performance checks here after input is read
    check_small_intervals(a, c);
    check_equal_intervals(a, c);
    check_small_initial_offset(b, d, a, c);

    int x = 0, y = 0, p = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < 10e7; i++) {
        if (b + a * x == d + c * y) {
            p = 1;
            break;
        } else if (b + a * x > d + c * y)
            y++;
        else if (b + a * x < d + c * y)
            x++;
    }
    if (p == 1)
        cout << b + a * x << endl;
    else
        cout << -1 << endl;
}
```

### Explanation

- **Checker Placement**: The checkers are placed immediately after reading the input values, ensuring that they do not introduce overhead inside the loop.
- **Abort on Trigger**: Each checker prints a warning and calls `abort()` if its condition is met, providing immediate feedback during execution.
- **Thresholds and Logic**: The thresholds in the checkers are based on logical deductions about what constitutes "small" or problematic values in this context, ensuring they effectively catch scenarios that may lead to performance issues.
