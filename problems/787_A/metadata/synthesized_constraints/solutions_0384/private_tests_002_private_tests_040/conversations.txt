system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

A monster is chasing after Rick and Morty on another planet. They're so frightened that sometimes they scream. More accurately, Rick screams at times b, b + a, b + 2a, b + 3a, ... and Morty screams at times d, d + c, d + 2c, d + 3c, .... 

<image>

The Monster will catch them if at any point they scream at the same time, so it wants to know when it will catch them (the first time they scream at the same time) or that they will never scream at the same time.

Input

The first line of input contains two integers a and b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100). 

The second line contains two integers c and d (1 ≤ c, d ≤ 100).

Output

Print the first time Rick and Morty will scream at the same time, or  - 1 if they will never scream at the same time.

Examples

Input

20 2
9 19


Output

82


Input

Output

Note

In the first sample testcase, Rick's 5th scream and Morty's 8th time are at time 82. 

In the second sample testcase, all Rick's screams will be at odd times and Morty's will be at even times, so they will never scream at the same time.

(F) Program Solving the Problem Statement

#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int i, j;
  int a, b, c, d;
  cin >> a >> b >> c >> d;
  for (i = 0; i < 10000; i++) {
    for (j = 0; j < 10000; j++) {
      if (b + a * i == d + c * j) {
        cout << b + a * i << endl;
        return 0;
      }
    }
  }
  cout << "-1" << endl;

} /* line 17 slow_hit_count: 0, fast_hit_count: 0 */


assistant: To diagnose the performance bottleneck in the given C code, let's analyze the hit count data and infer why the code runs slower with certain inputs.

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Hit Count Comparison**:
   - The loop in line 7 (`for (i = 0; i < 10000; i++)`) is executed 10001 times in the slow input scenario but only once in the fast input scenario.
   - The nested loop in line 8 (`for (j = 0; j < 10000; j++)`) is executed a total of 100,010,000 times for the slow input but only once for the fast input.
   - The condition check in line 9 (`if (b + a * i == d + c * j)`) is evaluated 100,000,000 times in the slow case, suggesting that it seldom finds a match.

2. **Inference on Code Interaction**:
   - The loops are interacting such that they only terminate early when the condition `b + a * i == d + c * j` is satisfied, which happens immediately in the fast input (as the initial values match directly).
   - For the slow input, no immediate match is found, and both loops must iterate many times, each time incrementing the indices `i` and `j`, which results in a longer computation time.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

From the analysis, the performance bottleneck arises due to the nested loop structure and the condition checking. Here are the performance-characterizing invariants in natural language:

1. **Invariant on Increment Values**:
   - "The performance degrades significantly when the increments `a` and `c` lead to a situation where many iterations are required to meet the condition `b + a * i == d + c * j`. This typically occurs when the arithmetic progressions for Rick and Morty do not align quickly, causing both loops to execute many times."

2. **Invariant on Initial Values**:
   - "When the initial times `b` and `d` and increments `a` and `c` cause the sequences of `b + a*i` and `d + c*j` to diverge significantly before converging, performance is adversely affected. Specifically, if the rate of increment `a` and `c` fail to produce equal values within reasonable bounds given the loop limits (10000 iterations), the execution time can be extensive."

3. **General Loop Execution**:
   - "The program's execution time may become excessively large if the alignment of Rick's and Morty's scream times requires exploring a large search space, such as when both loops iterate near their maximum (10000 iterations each), which is a potential worst-case scenario."

Overall, these invariants help describe situations in which the program can slow down significantly, focusing on the relationship between the sequences generated by `b, a` and `d, c`, and how quickly they find matching scream times. Adjusting the loop bounds or utilizing a more efficient algorithm or data structure could help avoid these bottlenecks.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
A monster is chasing after Rick and Morty on another planet. They're so frightened that sometimes they scream. More accurately, Rick screams at times b, b + a, b + 2a, b + 3a, ... and Morty screams at times d, d + c, d + 2c, d + 3c, .... 

<image>

The Monster will catch them if at any point they scream at the same time, so it wants to know when it will catch them (the first time they scream at the same time) or that they will never scream at the same time.

Input

The first line of input contains two integers a and b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100). 

The second line contains two integers c and d (1 ≤ c, d ≤ 100).

Output

Print the first time Rick and Morty will scream at the same time, or  - 1 if they will never scream at the same time.

Solution (C++ code):
{solution}


assistant: ### Phase 3: Implementing Performance-Characterizing Invariants in C++

We'll translate the natural language invariants into C++ code to check the conditions at runtime.

#### Invariant 1: Increment Values

```cpp
void check_increment_alignment(int a, int b, int c, int d) {
    if ((a == c) && ((b - d) % a != 0)) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - increments do not align quickly!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```
- **Explanation**: Checks if the increments `a` and `c` are the same but the initial values `b` and `d` cause them to never align properly, leading to maximum iterations.

#### Invariant 2: Initial Values

```cpp
void check_initial_value_alignment(int b, int d, int gcd_ac) {
    if ((b - d) % gcd_ac != 0) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - initial values never align under increments!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```
- **Explanation**: Uses the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `c` to determine if `b` and `d` can ever align under their respective increments.

### Phase 4: Integrating the Checkers into the Original Program

Now, let's integrate these checks into the original C++ program.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Function to calculate gcd
int gcd(int x, int y) {
    while (y != 0) {
        int temp = x % y;
        x = y;
        y = temp;
    }
    return x;
}

// Checker function for increment alignment
void check_increment_alignment(int a, int b, int c, int d) {
    if ((a == c) && ((b - d) % a != 0)) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - increments do not align quickly!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Checker function for initial value alignment
void check_initial_value_alignment(int b, int d, int gcd_ac) {
    if ((b - d) % gcd_ac != 0) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - initial values never align under increments!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    int a, b, c, d;
    cin >> a >> b >> c >> d;

    // Calculate gcd of a and c
    int gcd_ac = gcd(a, c);
    
    // Insert performance checks
    check_increment_alignment(a, b, c, d);
    check_initial_value_alignment(b, d, gcd_ac);
    
    for (int i = 0; i < 10000; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < 10000; j++) {
            if (b + a * i == d + c * j) {
                cout << b + a * i << endl;
                return 0;
            }
        }
    }
    cout << "-1" << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of Inserted Checks:
- **Increment Alignment Check**: After reading the input, this check ensures that if `a` equals `c`, then the difference of the initial values `b` and `d` must be divisible by `a` to avoid infinite mismatches.
- **Initial Value Alignment Check**: This leverages the greatest common divisor of `a` and `c` to check if the sequences can ever align, preventing unnecessary looping if alignment is never possible.

These checks are strategically placed after input reading and before entering the nested loops to catch costly execution paths early.
