=== Invariants Response ===
Based on the analysis of the provided C code and the hit counts for both the fast and slow inputs, let's go through the two phases to derive performance-characterizing invariants.

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Hit Count Analysis**:
   - The outer loop (line 12) runs `n + 1` times, and the inner loop (line 13) also runs `n + 1` times. Thus, the nested loops have a complexity of \(O(n^2)\).
   - For the slow input (n = 4000), the hit count of lines 12 and 13 are extremely high: 4002 and 16012002, respectively. This indicates that these loops are the primary source of inefficiency.
   - For the fast input (n = 3), the hit counts are much smaller, indicating that the loops complete quickly.

2. **Inefficiency Cause**:
   - The high hit counts on lines 15 and 16 suggest that the calculation of `k` and the subsequent conditions are repeated extensively. The main cause is the high iteration count due to large `n`, which leads to a high number of iterations across both loops.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **Invariants Based on the Analysis**:

   - **Invariant 1**: "If the length of the ribbon `n` is large, close to the upper constraint of 4000, and the lengths `a`, `b`, `c` are small, the loops iterate excessively, leading to a slowdown. This happens because the search space for feasible combinations of `i`, `j`, and `k` becomes very large."
     - This invariant suggests that when `n` is large and the possible piece lengths are small, the nested loops are extensively iterated to find a solution.

   - **Invariant 2**: "When the constraints allow many combinations of piece lengths that sum to `n`, the number of iterations in the nested loops increases significantly, causing slow execution."
     - This indicates that if there are many feasible combinations of `a`, `b`, and `c` that add up to `n`, the algorithm will take a longer time to find the best solution.

2. **Suggested Thresholds**:
   - Given `n <= 4000`, performance issues notably arise as `n` approaches this upper bound, especially if `a`, `b`, `c` are significantly smaller than `n`. This needs to be monitored, and optimizing the algorithm logic to reduce unnecessary iterations can help mitigate slowdowns.

### Conclusion

The primary cause of the performance bottleneck is the \(O(n^2)\) complexity arising from the nested loops iterating over all possible combinations of piece lengths. Optimizing the search strategy or leveraging dynamic programming techniques could improve efficiency for large `n`. These invariants help highlight scenarios where the current approach struggles, especially with large `n` and small `a`, `b`, `c`.

### Phase 3: Implement the Natural Language Invariants in C++

Let's translate the previously derived performance-characterizing invariants into C++ code snippets that can be integrated into the program to check for potential slowdowns.

#### Invariant 1:
Natural Language: "If the length of the ribbon `n` is large, close to the upper constraint of 4000, and the lengths `a`, `b`, `c` are small, the loops iterate excessively, leading to a slowdown."

```cpp
void check_large_n_small_abc_invariant(long long n, long long a, long long b, long long c) {
    if (n > 3500 && (a < 10 || b < 10 || c < 10)) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large n with small a, b, c" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

#### Invariant 2:
Natural Language: "When the constraints allow many combinations of piece lengths that sum to `n`, the number of iterations in the nested loops increases significantly, causing slow execution."

```cpp
void check_combinations_invariant(long long n, long long a, long long b, long long c) {
    if (n > 3500 && (a + b + c < 20)) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - many feasible combinations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrate the Checker Code with the Original Program

Here is the fully integrated C++ program with the performance checkers added to detect potential bottlenecks:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
const long long mod = 1000000007;
long long i, j;
long long temp;

void check_large_n_small_abc_invariant(long long n, long long a, long long b, long long c) {
    if (n > 3500 && (a < 10 || b < 10 || c < 10)) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large n with small a, b, c" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_combinations_invariant(long long n, long long a, long long b, long long c) {
    if (n > 3500 && (a + b + c < 20)) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - many feasible combinations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int32_t main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);
    long long n, a, b, c;
    cin >> n >> a >> b >> c;

    // Insert performance checkers
    check_large_n_small_abc_invariant(n, a, b, c);
    check_combinations_invariant(n, a, b, c);

    long long max = 0;
    for (i = 0; i < n + 1; i++) {
        for (j = 0; j < n + 1; j++) {
            long long k;
            k = n - (a * i + b * j);
            k /= c;
            if (a * i + b * j + c * k == n && i + j + k > max && k >= 0) {
                max = i + j + k;
            }
        }
    }
    cout << max;
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of Integration

- **Checker Placement**: The performance checkers are placed immediately after reading the input values. This ensures the conditions are evaluated before entering the potentially expensive loops.
- **Abort Mechanism**: Both checkers will output a warning and terminate the program if the conditions suggesting a potential bottleneck are met. This makes it easier to identify problematic input conditions during testing or fuzzing.
- **Thresholds**: The values such as `n > 3500` and piece lengths `a, b, c` less than 10 are chosen based on the invariant analysis to represent scenarios where performance degradation might occur due to large iteration counts. These thresholds were chosen considering the constraints (1 ≤ n, a, b, c ≤ 4000).
