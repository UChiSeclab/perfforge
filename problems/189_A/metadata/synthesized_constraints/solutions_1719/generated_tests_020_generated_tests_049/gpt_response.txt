=== Invariants Response ===
To analyze the given C code, let's follow the outlined methodology to determine the potential bottlenecks and derive performance-characterizing invariants.

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Line-Level Hit Count Analysis:**
   - **Lines 8 and 9**: The outer loop (`for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++)`) has 4002 hits for the slow input versus 5 for the fast input. The inner loop (`for (int j = 0; j <= n; j++)`) has 16,012,002 hits for the slow input versus 20 for the fast input.
   - These lines are the most hit, indicating that the loops are executing many more times on the slow input compared to the fast input.

2. **Inefficient Interaction with Data Structures:**
   - The loop structure (`i`, `j`) combined with calculations in line 10 (`k = n - (i * a + j * b)`) and the condition in line 11 (`if (k % c == 0 && k >= 0)`) imply a combinatorial exploration of possible ribbon cuts.
   - The condition checks and arithmetic operations are simple, but the sheer number of iterations makes this section of code costly.

3. **Impact of Input Constraints:**
   - Given `n <= 4000`, the loops explore a potential space of up to 16 million iterations for the slow input (n=4000), as opposed to a much smaller exploration space for the fast input.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the analysis, I'll derive performance-characterizing invariants that describe the conditions under which the program slows down:

1. **Invariant 1: High Iteration Count in Nested Loops**
   - **Natural Language Description**: "The program may slow down significantly when the value of `n` is high, especially close to its maximum constraint, leading to an extensive exploration of possible ribbon cuts in the nested loops."
   - **Explanation**: As `n` increases, the number of possible combinations for `i` and `j` grows, drastically increasing the loop execution count. This results in a combinatorial explosion of calculations for potential ribbon piece combinations.

2. **Invariant 2: Combinatorial Explosion Due to Small Piece Lengths**
   - **Natural Language Description**: "When the lengths `a`, `b`, or `c` are small, and `n` is large, the number of iterations in nested loops increases, which can lead to a performance bottleneck as every combination must be checked."
   - **Explanation**: Small length values for `a`, `b`, or `c` lead to a higher number of combinations that satisfy the conditions for cutting, thus increasing computation time.

3. **Invariant 3: Inefficient Execution for Maximum Piece Combinations**
   - **Natural Language Description**: "If the algorithm must compute maximum piece combinations for a large `n` with close or equal values among `a`, `b`, and `c`, it may slow down due to inefficient exploration of feasible solutions."
   - **Explanation**: When `a`, `b`, and `c` are close or equal, the algorithm cannot easily prune the search space, leading to many more iterations to find the optimal solution.

### Conclusion

These invariants focus on input values and structural aspects that trigger slow paths, such as high `n` values or specific characteristics of `a`, `b`, and `c`. By monitoring these conditions, you can anticipate potential performance issues in similar scenarios.

=== Checker Response ===
Let's proceed with implementing the natural language invariants derived in Phase 2 as runtime checks in C++.

### Phase 3: Implement the Natural Language Invariants in C++

We have derived the following performance-characterizing invariants:

1. **Invariant 1**: High iteration count in nested loops when `n` is large.
2. **Invariant 2**: Combinatorial explosion due to small piece lengths.
3. **Invariant 3**: Inefficient execution for maximum piece combinations when `a`, `b`, and `c` are close or equal.

Here is the C++ code implementing these checks:

```cpp
void check_high_iteration_invariant(int n) {
    if (n > 3500) { // Assuming 3500 as a threshold for high n value
        cerr << "Warning: High iteration invariant triggered - n is very large" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_small_piece_lengths_invariant(int a, int b, int c) {
    if (a < 5 && b < 5 && c < 5) { // Assuming values less than 5 are 'small'
        cerr << "Warning: Small piece lengths invariant triggered - all piece lengths are small" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_close_piece_lengths_invariant(int a, int b, int c) {
    if (abs(a - b) <= 1 && abs(b - c) <= 1 && abs(a - c) <= 1) { // Assuming closeness within 1 unit
        cerr << "Warning: Close piece lengths invariant triggered - piece lengths are similar" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrate the Checker Code into the Original Program

Now, let's integrate these checks into the original C++ code. We'll place the checks appropriately to avoid adding overhead in tight loops.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Function to check performance invariants
void check_high_iteration_invariant(int n) {
    if (n > 3500) { // Assuming 3500 as a threshold for high n value
        cerr << "Warning: High iteration invariant triggered - n is very large" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_small_piece_lengths_invariant(int a, int b, int c) {
    if (a < 5 && b < 5 && c < 5) { // Assuming values less than 5 are 'small'
        cerr << "Warning: Small piece lengths invariant triggered - all piece lengths are small" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_close_piece_lengths_invariant(int a, int b, int c) {
    if (abs(a - b) <= 1 && abs(b - c) <= 1 && abs(a - c) <= 1) { // Assuming closeness within 1 unit
        cerr << "Warning: Close piece lengths invariant triggered - piece lengths are similar" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int n, a, b, c;

void input() { 
    cin >> n >> a >> b >> c;
    
    // Check performance invariants after reading input
    check_high_iteration_invariant(n);
    check_small_piece_lengths_invariant(a, b, c);
    check_close_piece_lengths_invariant(a, b, c);
}

int mx = -1;
int k = 0;

void solve() {
    for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j <= n; j++) {
            k = n - (i * a + j * b);
            if (k % c == 0 && k >= 0) {
                mx = max(mx, i + j + (k / c));
            }
        }
    }
}

void output() { 
    cout << mx; 
}

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
    cin.tie(0);
    cout.tie(0);
    input();
    solve();
    output();
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Check Placement**: The checks are placed immediately after input reading to avoid slowing down the actual computation in the nested loops.
2. **Threshold Selection**: Thresholds used in the checker functions (e.g., `n > 3500`, `a < 5`, etc.) are chosen based on an assumption of what constitutes 'large' or 'small', taking the problem constraints into consideration (e.g., `1 ≤ n, a, b, c ≤ 4000`).
3. **Avoiding Redundancy**: Each invariant is checked once, ensuring that potential overlapping conditions do not result in redundant warnings.

This code should help detect when the conditions leading to performance bottlenecks are triggered, aiding in both debugging and further optimization efforts.
