### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Comparison of Hit Counts:**
   - The line-level hit counts indicate that the nested loops (lines 31-32) are executed significantly more often with the slow input. Specifically, line 31 has 4002 hits and line 32 has 16,012,002 hits with the slow input. In contrast, they have only 5 and 20 hits, respectively, with the fast input.
   - This suggests that the nested loops are a major bottleneck for the slow input.

2. **Pinpointing Costly Operations:**
   - The expressions within the nested loops (lines 33-55) are evaluated numerous times. Each line within the nested loop is hit over 16 million times in the slow case, whereas they are hit only 16 times in the fast case.
   - The conditions `(i * a) + (j * b) == n`, `(i * b) + (j * c) == n`, etc., are repeatedly checked, contributing to the slowdown.

3. **Inference:**
   - The nested loops iterate over a large range up to `n`, and since `n` is 4000 for the slow input, this results in a high number of iterations.
   - The loop conditions and calculations involve basic arithmetic operations but are checked excessively due to the large range of `i` and `j`.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **Invariants Describing Slow Path Conditions:**
   - **Invariant 1:** "If the value of `n` is large, close to its maximum constraint (e.g., 4000), and involves checking many combinations of `a`, `b`, and `c`, the iteration over a large search space significantly increases execution time."
     - **Explanation:** The program checks multiple arithmetic combinations of `a`, `b`, and `c` for every `i` and `j` in the nested loops up to `n`, leading to a combinatorial explosion in loop iteration count.
   
   - **Invariant 2:** "If the smallest piece length `j` is very small relative to `n`, this can lead to excessive iterations in the nested loops, as each potential combination is exhaustively checked."
     - **Explanation:** The choice of `j` as the smallest among `a`, `b`, and `c` means the loops have to cover a wide range of values, increasing the chances of each `(i * a) + (j * b)` combination needing to be checked.
   
   - **Invariant 3:** "When the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is close to `n`, the program may need to check multiple combinations, leading to inefficiencies through repeated calculations."
     - **Explanation:** When `n` approaches the sum of the piece lengths, more valid piece combinations exist, causing the loops to evaluate more conditions before finding the maximum number of pieces.

2. **Correlating Conditions to Input Patterns:**
   - These invariants suggest that combinations of input values leading to large search spaces result in slowdowns, especially when `n` is at its upper bound.
   - It is not solely the maximum value of `n` but also the relationship between `n` and the possible combinations of `a`, `b`, and `c` that determines performance.

By focusing on these invariants, one can understand when the program is likely to experience performance issues, particularly as `n` approaches its maximum constraint and when `a`, `b`, `c` lead to many valid combinations interacting with large loops.

### Phase 3: Implement the Natural Language Invariants in C++

Based on the previously inferred performance-characterizing invariants, here are the C++ checker codes for each invariant:

1. **Invariant 1:** Check when `n` is large and involves checking many combinations.
   ```cpp
   void check_large_n_invariant(int n) {
       if (n > 3500) {  // Assume a high value close to the max constraint of 4000
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - n is large!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Invariant 2:** Check when the smallest piece length causes excessive iterations.
   ```cpp
   void check_smallest_length_invariant(int j) {
       if (j < 10) {  // Assume a small piece length could trigger large iterations
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - smallest piece length is small!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Invariant 3:** When `n` is close to the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c`, indicating many possibilities.
   ```cpp
   void check_combination_invariant(int n, int a, int b, int c) {
       if (n > (a + b + c - 10)) {  // Allow some margin for how close they are
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - n is close to the sum of a, b, and c!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Integrate Conditional Checks into the Original Code

Now, integrate these checks into the given C++ program at appropriate points. The checks are placed immediately after input reading to avoid adding overhead in the tight loops.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Checker function prototypes
void check_large_n_invariant(int n);
void check_smallest_length_invariant(int j);
void check_combination_invariant(int n, int a, int b, int c);

int main() {
    int n, a, b, c, d = 1, e = 2, f = 3, i, j, h = 0, k = 0, l = 0, m = 0, o = 0,
        p = 0, q = 0, r = 0, s = 0, t = 0, u = 0, v = 0, w = 0, x = 0, y = 0;
    
    cin >> n >> a >> b >> c;

    // Determine the smallest of a, b, c
    if (a <= b && a <= c)
        j = a;
    else if (b <= a && b <= c)
        j = b;
    else if (c <= a && c <= b)
        j = c;

    // Insert checks at effective points
    check_large_n_invariant(n);
    check_smallest_length_invariant(j);
    check_combination_invariant(n, a, b, c);

    if (n % j != 0) {
        if (n == a || n == b || n == c) {
            if (a == b + c || b == c + a || c == a + b) {
            } else {
                o++;
                s = d;
            }
        }
        if (n == a + b || n == b + c || n == a + c) {
            o++;
            s = e;
        }
        if (n == a + b + c) {
            o++;
            s = f;
        }
    }
    for (i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
        for (j = 0; j <= n; j++) {
            if ((i * a) + (j * b) == n) {
                p = i + j;
                if (p > k) k = p;
            }
            if ((i * b) + (j * c) == n) {
                q = i + j;
                if (q > l) l = q;
            }
            if ((i * c) + (j * a) == n) {
                r = i + j;
                if (r > m) m = r;
            }
            if ((i * a) + (j * b) + c == n) {
                t = i + j + 1;
                if (t > u) u = t;
            }
            if ((i * b) + (j * c) + a == n) {
                v = i + j + 1;
                if (v > w) w = v;
            }
            if ((i * c) + (j * a) + b == n) {
                x = i + j + 1;
                if (x > y) y = x;
            }
        }
    }
    if (k > s || l > s || m > s || u > s || w > s || y > s) {
        if (k >= l && k >= m && k >= u && k >= w && k >= y)
            cout << k;
        else if (l >= k && l >= m && l >= u && l >= w && l >= y)
            cout << l;
        else if (m >= k && m >= l && m >= u && m >= w && m >= y)
            cout << m;
        else if (u >= k && u >= l && u >= w && u >= y)
            cout << u;
        else if (w >= k && w >= l && w >= u && w >= y)
            cout << w;
        else if (y >= k && y >= l && y >= u && y >= w)
            cout << y;
    } else {
        cout << s;
    }
    return 0;
}

// Implementations of checker functions
void check_large_n_invariant(int n) {
    if (n > 3500) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - n is large!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_smallest_length_invariant(int j) {
    if (j < 10) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - smallest piece length is small!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_combination_invariant(int n, int a, int b, int c) {
    if (n > (a + b + c - 10)) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - n is close to the sum of a, b, and c!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Explanation
- **check_large_n_invariant** detects if `n` is near its maximum constraint, which could lead to high iteration counts and slow performance.
- **check_smallest_length_invariant** is used to detect when the smallest length `j` is very small, potentially increasing the range for the nested loops.
- **check_combination_invariant** checks if the value of `n` is close to the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c`, which could indicate an increased number of valid ribbon piece combinations and potential slowdowns.

The checks are inserted after reading inputs to quickly identify potential performance issues without adding unnecessary overhead during the computation-intensive parts of the program.
