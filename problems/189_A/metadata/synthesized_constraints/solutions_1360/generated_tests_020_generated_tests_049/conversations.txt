system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

Polycarpus has a ribbon, its length is n. He wants to cut the ribbon in a way that fulfils the following two conditions: 

  * After the cutting each ribbon piece should have length a, b or c. 
  * After the cutting the number of ribbon pieces should be maximum. 



Help Polycarpus and find the number of ribbon pieces after the required cutting.

Input

The first line contains four space-separated integers n, a, b and c (1 ≤ n, a, b, c ≤ 4000) — the length of the original ribbon and the acceptable lengths of the ribbon pieces after the cutting, correspondingly. The numbers a, b and c can coincide.

Output

Print a single number — the maximum possible number of ribbon pieces. It is guaranteed that at least one correct ribbon cutting exists.

Examples

Input

Note

In the first example Polycarpus can cut the ribbon in such way: the first piece has length 2, the second piece has length 3.

In the second example Polycarpus can cut the ribbon in such way: the first piece has length 5, the second piece has length 2.

(F) Program Solving the Problem Statement

  int n, a, b, c, piece = 0, i, j, k;
  cin >> n >> a >> b >> c;

    piece = n;
  else {
    for (i = 0; i <= n / a; i++) {
      for (j = 0; j <= (n - i * a) / b; j++) {
        for (k = 0; k <= (n - i * a - j * b) / c; k++) {
          if (i * a + j * b + k * c == n) piece = max(piece, i + j + k);
        }
      }
    }
  }
  cout << piece;
  return 0;

} /* line 19 slow_hit_count: 0, fast_hit_count: 0 */


assistant: Based on the given C code and the provided input scenarios, let's analyze the performance characteristics and derive potential invariants:

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Nested Loop Analysis**:
   - The code contains three nested loops (lines 9, 10, and 11) which iterate over variables `i`, `j`, and `k`.
   - For the slow input, the loops are entered a significantly higher number of times compared to the fast input, with line 11 showing an especially high hit count of 357,558,557 compared to just 5 for the fast input.
   - This suggests that the combination of values `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` allows for many possible combinations of `i`, `j`, and `k`, leading to excessive iterations in the slow scenario.

2. **Hit Count Disparity**:
   - Line 12, which contains the conditional check and potential update operation, is hit a massive number of times (357,024,023) for the slow input, confirming that the condition is frequently evaluated and often true.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the above analysis, we can derive the following natural language performance invariants:

1. **Invariant: High Iteration Counts Leading to Slow Execution**:
   - **Description**: "When the target length `n` is large and can be composed of many combinations of piece lengths `a`, `b`, and `c`, the nested loops will have a vast search space, leading to slow execution."
   - **Reasoning**: The slow input causes significantly more iterations due to a large number of possible combinations that sum to `n`.

2. **Invariant: Extensive Search Space with Small Piece Sizes**:
   - **Description**: "If the piece lengths `a`, `b`, and `c` are relatively small compared to `n`, and there are many different ways to sum them to reach `n`, the program may experience performance degradation due to exploring too many possible combinations."
   - **Reasoning**: Small piece sizes relative to a large `n` allow for numerous combinations, significantly increasing the number of iterations needed to find the maximum number of pieces.

3. **Invariant: Maximizing Combinations for Large `n`**:
   - **Description**: "When `n` approaches its maximum constraint and the piece lengths allow numerous combinations, the performance may degrade as the program attempts to find the optimal set of piece counts."
   - **Reasoning**: As `n` approaches its constraint of 4000 and with flexible piece sizes, the search space grows rapidly, causing the nested loops to run extensively.

By focusing on these high-level conditions, we can identify scenarios where the program may exhibit slow performance due to excessive iteration and exploration of combinations allowed by the input constraints.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
Polycarpus has a ribbon, its length is n. He wants to cut the ribbon in a way that fulfils the following two conditions: 

  * After the cutting each ribbon piece should have length a, b or c. 
  * After the cutting the number of ribbon pieces should be maximum. 



Help Polycarpus and find the number of ribbon pieces after the required cutting.

Input

The first line contains four space-separated integers n, a, b and c (1 ≤ n, a, b, c ≤ 4000) — the length of the original ribbon and the acceptable lengths of the ribbon pieces after the cutting, correspondingly. The numbers a, b and c can coincide.

Output

Print a single number — the maximum possible number of ribbon pieces. It is guaranteed that at least one correct ribbon cutting exists.

Examples

In the first example Polycarpus can cut the ribbon in such way: the first piece has length 2, the second piece has length 3.

In the second example Polycarpus can cut the ribbon in such way: the first piece has length 5, the second piece has length 2.

Solution (C++ code):
{solution}


assistant: ### Phase 3: Implement the Natural Language Invariants in C++

Here, I'll translate the derived invariants into C++ code snippets that serve as runtime checks:

1. **Invariant: High Iteration Counts Leading to Slow Execution**

```cpp
void check_high_iteration_invariant(int n, int a, int b, int c) {
    // Check if the number of combinations is too high, implying excessive iterations
    if (n > 3000 && a < 50 && b < 50 && c < 50) {
        cerr << "Warning: High iteration invariant triggered - excessive combinations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

2. **Invariant: Extensive Search Space with Small Piece Sizes**

```cpp
void check_small_piece_sizes_invariant(int n, int a, int b, int c) {
    // Check if small piece sizes relative to n could result in excessive combinations
    if (n > 3000 && (a < n/10 || b < n/10 || c < n/10)) {
        cerr << "Warning: Small piece size invariant triggered - extensive search space" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

3. **Invariant: Maximizing Combinations for Large `n`**

```cpp
void check_large_n_invariant(int n, int a, int b, int c) {
    // Check if n is very large and can combine piece lengths in many ways
    if (n > 3500 && (a < n/5 && b < n/5 && c < n/5)) {
        cerr << "Warning: Large n invariant triggered - maximizing combinations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrate Checkers into the Original Program

Now, I will integrate the checker functions into the existing C++ program at appropriate positions:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Invariant checkers
void check_high_iteration_invariant(int n, int a, int b, int c) {
    if (n > 3000 && a < 50 && b < 50 && c < 50) {
        cerr << "Warning: High iteration invariant triggered - excessive combinations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_small_piece_sizes_invariant(int n, int a, int b, int c) {
    if (n > 3000 && (a < n/10 || b < n/10 || c < n/10)) {
        cerr << "Warning: Small piece size invariant triggered - extensive search space" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_large_n_invariant(int n, int a, int b, int c) {
    if (n > 3500 && (a < n/5 && b < n/5 && c < n/5)) {
        cerr << "Warning: Large n invariant triggered - maximizing combinations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    int n, a, b, c, piece = 0, i, j, k;
    cin >> n >> a >> b >> c;

    // Insert checks after reading input to prevent unnecessary loop execution
    check_high_iteration_invariant(n, a, b, c);
    check_small_piece_sizes_invariant(n, a, b, c);
    check_large_n_invariant(n, a, b, c);

    if (a == 1 || b == 1 || c == 1) {
        piece = n;
    } else {
        for (i = 0; i <= n / a; i++) {
            for (j = 0; j <= (n - i * a) / b; j++) {
                for (k = 0; k <= (n - i * a - j * b) / c; k++) {
                    if (i * a + j * b + k * c == n) piece = max(piece, i + j + k);
                }
            }
        }
    }
    cout << piece;
    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation for Placement**:
- The checks are placed immediately after reading the input values. This is effective because it prevents the nested loops from being entered at all if a performance bottleneck condition is detected.
- This placement ensures minimal overhead while providing early detection of conditions that could lead to poor performance.
