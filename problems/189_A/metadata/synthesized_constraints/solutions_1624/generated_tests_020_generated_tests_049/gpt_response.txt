### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Line-level Hit Count Analysis:**
   - The outer loop (line 6) iterates 4002 times with the slow input compared to only 5 times with the fast input.
   - The inner loop (line 7) is the most significant bottleneck, with 16,012,002 hits for the slow input, compared to 20 hits for the fast input. This indicates a combinatorial explosion in iterations.
   - The conditional check at line 10 (`if (i % a == 0 && j % b == 0 && tmp % c == 0)`) is hit 8,006,001 times for the slow input, but only 10 times for the fast input.
   - The lines where the temporary calculation and max update occur (lines 11 and 12) are only executed 267,334 times for the slow input, which shows that the condition on line 10 rarely succeeds relative to the number of iterations.

2. **Interaction with Data Structures and Loops:**
   - The nested loops iterate over the possible values of `i` and `j` ranging up to `n`, causing a quadratic complexity.
   - The condition checks involve modulo operations, suggesting inefficiencies when `i`, `j`, and `tmp` (computed from `n - i - j`) do not satisfy the divisibility condition, leading to frequent execution of loops without productive results.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **Natural Language Invariants:**
   - **Invariant #1:** "When the ribbon length `n` is large, and the target lengths `a`, `b`, and `c` result in many combinations that do not satisfy the divisibility condition, the nested loops iterate excessively, causing a slowdown."
   - **Invariant #2:** "If `n` is at the upper constraint limit and the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` create a high number of unsuccessful checks due to the condition `i % a == 0 && j % b == 0 && tmp % c == 0`, the program significantly slows down."
   - **Invariant #3:** "When lengths `a`, `b`, and `c` are relatively small compared to `n`, the number of redundant iterations in the nested loops increases, leading to performance degradation."

2. **Correlating Conditions to Input Patterns:**
   - These conditions indicate that inefficiency arises when `n` is maximized and the divisibility conditions are rarely met, leading to a waste of computational effort in the loops.
   - The inefficiency correlates with input patterns where `n` approaches its constraint limit, and `a`, `b`, and `c` are not factors that result in frequent successful divisions, thus triggering many unused iterations.

These performance-characterizing invariants are designed to help detect and understand slow performance scenarios in the code while remaining abstract enough to generalize across potential future inputs adhering to the problem constraints (1 ≤ n, a, b, c ≤ 4000).

### Phase 3: Implement the Natural Language Invariants as C++ Checkers

Below are the checkers implemented in C++ based on the performance-characterizing invariants identified earlier:

```cpp
void check_large_n_with_small_pieces(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large n with small a, b, c leading to excessive loop iterations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_high_unsuccessful_checks(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high number of unsuccessful checks due to divisibility conditions!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_relative_size_inefficiency(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - inefficient relative sizes of n vs a, b, c!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrate Checkers into the Original Program

Here is the original C++ program instrumented with the checkers:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int n, t, a, b, c, ans;

// Checker function implementations
void check_large_n_with_small_pieces(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large n with small a, b, c leading to excessive loop iterations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_high_unsuccessful_checks(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high number of unsuccessful checks due to divisibility conditions!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_relative_size_inefficiency(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - inefficient relative sizes of n vs a, b, c!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void solve() {
    ans = -1;

    // Check for large n with small piece sizes
    check_large_n_with_small_pieces((n > 3000) && (a < 10 || b < 10 || c < 10));

    for (int i = 0, _b = n; i <= _b; i++) {
        for (int j = 0, _b = n; j <= _b; j++) {
            int tmp = n - i - j;
            if (tmp < 0) continue;
            
            // Check for high number of unsuccessful checks
            check_high_unsuccessful_checks((i % a != 0 || j % b != 0 || tmp % c != 0) && (i + j < 10));

            if (i % a == 0 && j % b == 0 && tmp % c == 0) {
                int tmp2 = i / a + j / b + tmp / c;
                ans = max(ans, tmp2);
            }
        }
    }

    cout << ans << endl;
}

int main() {
    scanf("%d", &n);
    scanf("%d %d %d", &a, &b, &c);
    
    // Check for inefficient relative size of n vs a, b, c
    check_relative_size_inefficiency(n > 3500 && a + b + c < 30);

    solve();
    return 0;
}
```

### Comments on the Instrumentation

- **Check for Large `n` with Small Piece Sizes**: Implemented before the loops to prevent excessive iterations when `n` is large, but `a`, `b`, and `c` are small.
- **Check for High Unsuccessful Divisibility Checks**: Placed within the loops but guarded by a heuristic for small loop variable values to balance between effective detection and avoiding unnecessary overhead.
- **Check for Inefficient Relative Sizes**: Implemented before the solve function, ensuring that the sizes of `a`, `b`, and `c` relative to `n` do not result in inefficiencies. 

These checks provide warnings and halt execution when potential performance bottlenecks are detected, aiding in testing and optimization efforts.
