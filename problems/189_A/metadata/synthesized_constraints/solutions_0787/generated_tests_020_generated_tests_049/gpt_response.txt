=== Invariants Response ===
To diagnose the performance bottlenecks in the given C program and derive conditions or invariants characterizing the slowdown, let's analyze the line-level hit counts for both the fast and slow inputs.

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Hit Count Analysis**:
   - The function `fun` is called significantly more often during the slow input run as compared to the fast input run. Specifically, `slow_hit_count` for the `fun` function and its associated lines is on the order of millions, while the `fast_hit_count` is only 7 or less for the same lines.
   - **Recursion**: The lines responsible for the recursion (`fun(n - a, count + 1)`, `fun(n - b, count + 1)`, `fun(n - c, count + 1)`) are hit 2,400,000 times each under the slow input. The memoization check (`if (dp[n][count] != -1)`) is also heavily utilized, indicating the recursive nature of the problem.

2. **Data Structure Interaction**:
   - The 2D array `dp` is used for memoization. The program checks `dp[n][count]` before proceeding with computation, which is indicative of cached results being reused. However, the recursion still results in deep explorations, particularly with larger values of `n`.

3. **Constraints and Complexity**:
   - The recursive calls explore multiple paths where each path length is reduced by `a`, `b`, or `c`. With the maximum constraints (`n = 4000`), this leads to many overlapping subproblems, and despite memoization, the recursion depth and breadth can grow significantly.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the analysis, let's create natural language statements that capture the conditions under which the program slows down:

1. **Recursion Depth and Search Space**:
   - **Invariant**: "When the initial ribbon length `n` is large and close to the constraint limit, and when there are multiple ways to partition the ribbon into pieces of lengths `a`, `b`, and `c`, the recursive exploration of possible cuts can become very broad and deep, significantly increasing computation time."
   
2. **Memoization Efficiency**:
   - **Invariant**: "If the number of distinct subproblems is close to the size of the `dp` array due to high values of `n` and diverse options for `a`, `b`, and `c`, the overhead of memoization may not sufficiently optimize the recursive computation, leading to slower execution."

3. **Path Exploration**:
   - **Invariant**: "When `a`, `b`, and `c` are relatively small compared to `n`, leading to a high branching factor in the recursive function, the number of potential recursive paths increases, thereby exacerbating the performance bottleneck."

These invariants highlight the conditions for slow performance, particularly when the recursive approach has to explore many potential cuts and when memoization cannot fully mitigate this exploration due to the structure and constraints of the problem.

### Recommendations

1. **Memoization Optimization**: Ensure that memoization is effectively capturing and reusing results, potentially reducing the dimensionality of `dp` if possible to the critical parameters.
2. **Iterative Rewrite**: Consider an iterative approach or dynamic programming solution that iteratively builds solutions from smaller subproblems, potentially reducing the recursion overhead.
3. **Threshold for Recursion**: Implement checks or early returns for when `n` is very large and `a`, `b`, and `c` lead to many permutations, limiting unnecessary recursive calls.

=== Checker Response ===
### Phase 3: Implement Checker Code in C++

Based on the performance-characterizing invariants derived earlier, we can implement the corresponding checker code. Here are the checkers for each invariant:

1. **Recursion Depth and Search Space Checker**:
   - Checks if `n` is large and the combination of `a`, `b`, and `c` leads to a broad and deep recursive search space.

```cpp
void check_recursion_invariant(long long n, long long a, long long b, long long c) {
    if (n > 3000 && (n % a == 0 || n % b == 0 || n % c == 0)) {
        cerr << "Warning: Recursion invariant triggered - large n with multiple partition options" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

2. **Memoization Efficiency Checker**:
   - Verifies if the number of subproblems approaches the size of the `dp` table, affecting memoization efficiency.

```cpp
void check_memoization_invariant(long long n, long long a, long long b, long long c) {
    if ((n > 3000) && (a < 10 || b < 10 || c < 10)) {
        cerr << "Warning: Memoization invariant triggered - inefficient memoization with small partition lengths" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

3. **Path Exploration Checker**:
   - Checks if small values of `a`, `b`, and `c` result in a high branching factor.

```cpp
void check_branching_invariant(long long a, long long b, long long c) {
    if ((a < 5 && b < 5 && c < 5)) {
        cerr << "Warning: Branching invariant triggered - high branching factor due to small partition lengths" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrate Checker Code into the Original Program

Now, we will integrate these checks into the original C++ code provided:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

const long long MAX = 1e5 + 5;
const long long modu = 1e9 + 7;
long long n, a, b, c;
long long dp[4005][4005];

void check_recursion_invariant(long long n, long long a, long long b, long long c) {
    if (n > 3000 && (n % a == 0 || n % b == 0 || n % c == 0)) {
        cerr << "Warning: Recursion invariant triggered - large n with multiple partition options" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_memoization_invariant(long long n, long long a, long long b, long long c) {
    if ((n > 3000) && (a < 10 || b < 10 || c < 10)) {
        cerr << "Warning: Memoization invariant triggered - inefficient memoization with small partition lengths" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_branching_invariant(long long a, long long b, long long c) {
    if ((a < 5 && b < 5 && c < 5)) {
        cerr << "Warning: Branching invariant triggered - high branching factor due to small partition lengths" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

long long fun(long long n, long long count) {
    if (n < 0) return 0;
    if (dp[n][count] != -1) return dp[n][count];
    if (n == 0) return count;
    long long ans1 = fun(n - a, count + 1);
    long long ans2 = fun(n - b, count + 1);
    long long ans3 = fun(n - c, count + 1);
    return dp[n][count] = max(ans1, max(ans2, ans3));
}

int32_t main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);
    cout.tie(NULL);

    cin >> n >> a >> b >> c;

    // Insert checkers after reading inputs
    check_recursion_invariant(n, a, b, c);
    check_memoization_invariant(n, a, b, c);
    check_branching_invariant(a, b, c);

    memset(dp, -1, sizeof(dp));
    cout << fun(n, 0);
}
```

### Explanation

- **Recursion Depth and Search Space**: The check is performed immediately after reading input values to ensure that we catch cases where `n` is large and has multiple partition options.
- **Memoization Efficiency**: Checks are also made after input to ensure `dp` effectiveness.
- **Path Exploration**: Verifies reasonable partition sizes to prevent high branching.
- These checks will help catch edge cases leading to performance bottlenecks, allowing the program to abort and warn about potential inefficiencies.
