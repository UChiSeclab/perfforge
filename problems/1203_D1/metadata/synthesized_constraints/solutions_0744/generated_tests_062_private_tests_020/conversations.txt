system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

The only difference between easy and hard versions is the length of the string.

You are given a string s and a string t, both consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. It is guaranteed that t can be obtained from s by removing some (possibly, zero) number of characters (not necessary contiguous) from s without changing order of remaining characters (in other words, it is guaranteed that t is a subsequence of s).

For example, the strings "test", "tst", "tt", "et" and "" are subsequences of the string "test". But the strings "tset", "se", "contest" are not subsequences of the string "test".

You want to remove some substring (contiguous subsequence) from s of maximum possible length such that after removing this substring t will remain a subsequence of s.

If you want to remove the substring s[l;r] then the string s will be transformed to s_1 s_2 ... s_{l-1} s_{r+1} s_{r+2} ... s_{|s|-1} s_{|s|} (where |s| is the length of s).

Your task is to find the maximum possible length of the substring you can remove so that t is still a subsequence of s.

Input

The first line of the input contains one string s consisting of at least 1 and at most 200 lowercase Latin letters.

The second line of the input contains one string t consisting of at least 1 and at most 200 lowercase Latin letters.

It is guaranteed that t is a subsequence of s.

Output

Print one integer — the maximum possible length of the substring you can remove so that t is still a subsequence of s.

assistant: To diagnose the performance bottleneck in the provided C code, we need to analyze the execution pattern and identify which parts of the code are contributing to the slowdown, especially for the slow input. Let's go through the phases as requested:

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Line-Level Hit Count Comparison:**
   - The nested loops starting at lines 13 and 14 have significantly higher hit counts for the slow input than for the fast input.
   - The while-loop (line 17) and the operations inside it (lines 18-20) are executed extremely frequently in the slow case, indicating that a large portion of the computation time is spent here.

2. **Pinpointing Lines with More Hits:**
   - The outer loop (line 13) iterates over each character of `s`, while the inner loop (line 14) iterates from the current `i` to the end of `s`.
   - The inner loop on line 14 has about 20300 iterations for the slow input, compared to just 2 for the fast input.
   - Within the nested loops, the while-loop (line 17) is executed 2,686,898 times for the slow input, indicating heavy computation.

3. **Interactions with Data Structures:**
   - The two pointers `p` and `q` are used to check if `t` is still a subsequence of `s` after potentially removing a substring.
   - The frequent reset and increment operations for `p` (lines 18-20) within the while-loop suggest inefficient handling of subsequence verification.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the analysis, we can derive performance-characterizing invariants to identify conditions where the program is likely to be slow:

1. **Long Substring Checks:**
   - **Invariant Description:** "When the string `s` is much larger than `t` and the algorithm attempts to find the longest removable substring, the program may enter a slow path due to excessive iteration over potential substrings."
   - **Rationale:** This slow path is triggered when the length of `s` is significantly larger than `t`, leading to extensive exploration of possible substrings to remove, especially since the outer and inner loops iterate over `n`, which can be as large as 200.

2. **Inefficient Subsequence Verification:**
   - **Invariant Description:** "If verifying that `t` remains a subsequence of `s` involves checking many characters in `s` repeatedly, the program can slow down considerably."
   - **Rationale:** The frequent iterations through `s` to verify subsequence status (lines 17-20) suggest that the subsequence checking logic becomes expensive as `s` grows larger and contains numerous potential positions for `t`.

3. **Complexity from Nested Loops:**
   - **Invariant Description:** "The combination of nested loops iterating over the string `s` can cause a slowdown, especially when the length of `s` approaches the upper limit (200) and requires checking many substrings."
   - **Rationale:** The nested loop structure leads to a quadratic number of iterations, which becomes significant as `n` approaches 200, the constraint limit.

These invariants focus on the general patterns and structure of the problem (e.g., nested loops and subsequence verification) without relying on specific numeric values from the input, making them applicable to future scenarios within the given constraints.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
The only difference between easy and hard versions is the length of the string.

You are given a string s and a string t, both consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. It is guaranteed that t can be obtained from s by removing some (possibly, zero) number of characters (not necessary contiguous) from s without changing order of remaining characters (in other words, it is guaranteed that t is a subsequence of s).

For example, the strings "test", "tst", "tt", "et" and "" are subsequences of the string "test". But the strings "tset", "se", "contest" are not subsequences of the string "test".

You want to remove some substring (contiguous subsequence) from s of maximum possible length such that after removing this substring t will remain a subsequence of s.

If you want to remove the substring s[l;r] then the string s will be transformed to s_1 s_2 ... s_{l-1} s_{r+1} s_{r+2} ... s_{|s|-1} s_{|s|} (where |s| is the length of s).

Your task is to find the maximum possible length of the substring you can remove so that t is still a subsequence of s.

Input

The first line of the input contains one string s consisting of at least 1 and at most 200 lowercase Latin letters.

The second line of the input contains one string t consisting of at least 1 and at most 200 lowercase Latin letters.

It is guaranteed that t is a subsequence of s.

Output

Print one integer — the maximum possible length of the substring you can remove so that t is still a subsequence of s.

assistant: ### Phase 3: Implement the Natural Language Invariants in C++

Based on the performance-characterizing invariants we derived, here are the C++ code snippets to check each condition at runtime.

1. **Invariant for Long Substring Checks:**
   ```cpp
   void check_long_substring_invariant(int n, int m) {
       if (n > m * 2) {  // Arbitrary threshold considering large `s` relative to `t`
           cerr << "Warning: Potential slowdown due to large `s` relative to `t`!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Invariant for Inefficient Subsequence Verification:**
   ```cpp
   void check_subsequence_verification_invariant(int n) {
       if (n > 150) { // Since n <= 200, checking when n is relatively high
           cerr << "Warning: Potential inefficiency in subsequence verification!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Invariant for Complexity from Nested Loops:**
   ```cpp
   void check_nested_loop_invariant(int n) {
       if (n > 180) { // Close to the upper limit
           cerr << "Warning: Inefficiency due to nested loop complexity!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Integrate Checkers with Original Program

Now we'll integrate these checker functions into the original C++ program to monitor conditions where slow performance might occur.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
using ll = long long;

void check_long_substring_invariant(int n, int m) {
    if (n > m * 2) {  // Arbitrary threshold considering large `s` relative to `t`
        cerr << "Warning: Potential slowdown due to large `s` relative to `t`!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_subsequence_verification_invariant(int n) {
    if (n > 150) { // Since n <= 200, checking when n is relatively high
        cerr << "Warning: Potential inefficiency in subsequence verification!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_nested_loop_invariant(int n) {
    if (n > 180) { // Close to the upper limit
        cerr << "Warning: Inefficiency due to nested loop complexity!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    string s, t;
    cin >> s >> t;
    int n = s.size(), m = t.size();

    // Inserted checks for performance characteristics
    check_long_substring_invariant(n, m);  // Check after reading input
    check_subsequence_verification_invariant(n);  // Check before loops
    check_nested_loop_invariant(n);  // Check before loops

    int ans = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (int j = i; j < n; j++) {
            if (n - j + i - 1 < m) continue;
            int p = 0, q = 0;
            while (p < n) {
                if (i <= p && p <= j) p = j + 1;
                if (p < n && q < m && s[p] == t[q]) q++;
                p++;
            }
            if (q == m) ans = max(ans, j - i + 1);
        }
    }
    printf("%d\n", ans);
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of Integration

- **Checker Functions:** Each checker function is defined to test a specific invariant condition described in natural language. They output a warning message and abort the program if their condition is met.
- **Placement of Checks:** 
  - **After Reading Inputs:** We place the `check_long_substring_invariant` right after the input is read, as it depends on the relative size of `s` and `t`.
  - **Before Heavy Loops:** The `check_subsequence_verification_invariant` and `check_nested_loop_invariant` are placed right before the loops where the heavy computation begins, ensuring the program doesn't enter a slow path. These checks ensure that the program is monitored for known bottlenecks without introducing additional overhead inside the loops.
