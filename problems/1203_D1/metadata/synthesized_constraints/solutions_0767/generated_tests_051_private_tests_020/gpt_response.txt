### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

By analyzing the hit counts, we can identify the following potential performance issues in the code:

1. **Nested Loops (Lines 15 and 16):**
   - The outer loop on line 15 iterates over each character of `s`, and the inner loop on line 16 iterates from the current character to the end of the string `s`. This results in a quadratic number of iterations with respect to the length of `s`.
   - For the slow input, `line 15` is hit 201 times and `line 16` is hit 20,300 times, indicating that these loops are executed frequently and are potentially causing the slowdown.

2. **String Construction (Line 19):**
   - The loop on line 18 goes over the entire string `s` to construct a new string `ss` by excluding the substring from index `i` to `j`. This reconstruction happens for every iteration of `j` within the nested loops, resulting in a significant computational overhead.

3. **While Loop for Subsequence Check (Lines 22-24):**
   - This loop checks if `t` is a subsequence of the newly constructed string `ss`. For the slow input, this loop's body (line 22) has a hit count of 931,450, reflecting the repeated subsequence checks that contribute to the slowdown.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the analysis above, we can formulate the following performance-characterizing invariants:

1. **Invariant 1: Quadratic Nested Loops**
   - **Natural Language Statement:** "If the length of `s` approaches the upper constraint, the quadratic nested loops for selecting subranges of `s` can lead to a significant performance hit."
   - This invariant is relevant because the outer and inner loops iterate over the length of `s`, leading to `O(n^2)` operations, where `n` is the length of `s`.

2. **Invariant 2: String Reconstruction Overhead**
   - **Natural Language Statement:** "Frequent reconstruction of the string `ss` occurs when a large substring needs to be skipped repeatedly, leading to inefficiencies."
   - The string `ss` is rebuilt for every combination of `i` and `j`, which becomes costly as the length of `s` increases.

3. **Invariant 3: Subsequence Verification**
   - **Natural Language Statement:** "The subsequence verification loop incurs a high computational cost when many characters need to be checked in `s` against `t` across multiple iterations."
   - This invariant highlights the expensive nature of checking subsequence conditions within the nested loops.

These invariants identify the main scenarios leading to performance bottlenecks, especially when the input size is near the constraint limit (200 characters in this case). They focus on the structural aspects of the problem and the iterative nature of the solution that exacerbate the slowdown.

### Phase 3: Implementing Natural Language Invariants in C++

Here, I'll translate each of the previously derived performance-characterizing invariants into C++ checks.

1. **Invariant 1: Quadratic Nested Loops**
   - The loops iterating over the length of `s` can become a bottleneck when `s` approaches its upper length constraint.
   
   ```cpp
   void check_nested_loop_invariant(int len1) {
       if (len1 > 150) { // Threshold chosen based on potential slowdown near max constraint
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to nested loops with large input size!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Invariant 2: String Reconstruction Overhead**
   - Frequent reconstruction of `ss` can lead to inefficiencies.
   
   ```cpp
   void check_string_reconstruction_invariant(int len1, int len2) {
       if (len1 > 150 && len2 < 10) { // Thresholds emphasizing inefficient reconstruction
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to frequent string reconstruction!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Invariant 3: Subsequence Verification**
   - The subsequence checking loop can become costly when executed frequently for large strings.
   
   ```cpp
   void check_subsequence_verification_invariant(int len1, int len2) {
       if (len1 * len2 > 10000) { // Product threshold for indicating high computational cost
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to exhaustive subsequence verification!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Integrating Checkers into the Original Program

Now, I'll integrate these checks into the program at suitable places to ensure they do not degrade performance further.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
const int maxn = 2e5 + 5;
const int maxm = 5000 + 5;
const int MOD = 1e9 + 7;
char s[maxn], t[maxn], ss[maxn];
int next_[10010];
int ans;

// Implementation of invariant checks
void check_nested_loop_invariant(int len1) {
    if (len1 > 150) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to nested loops with large input size!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_string_reconstruction_invariant(int len1, int len2) {
    if (len1 > 150 && len2 < 10) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to frequent string reconstruction!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_subsequence_verification_invariant(int len1, int len2) {
    if (len1 * len2 > 10000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to exhaustive subsequence verification!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(0);
    cout.tie(0);
    cin >> s >> t;
    int len1 = strlen(s), len2 = strlen(t);

    // Insert invariant checks
    check_nested_loop_invariant(len1);
    check_string_reconstruction_invariant(len1, len2);
    check_subsequence_verification_invariant(len1, len2);

    for (int i = 0; i <= len1 - 1; i++) {
        for (int j = i; j <= len1 - 1; j++) {
            int cur = 0;
            for (int k = 0; k <= len1 - 1; k++) {
                if (k < i || k > j) ss[cur++] = s[k];
            }
            int l = 0, r = 0;
            while (l < cur && r < len2) {
                if (t[r] == ss[l]) r++;
                l++;
            }
            if (r == len2) {
                ans = max(ans, j - i + 1);
            }
        }
    }
    cout << ans;
    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**
- **Check Placement:** The checks are placed after reading the input and calculating lengths, which is before entering the loops. This ensures that they alert potential bottlenecks without adding overhead to the actual loop operations.
- **Thresholds:** The thresholds in the checks are selected to provide early warnings when `s` and `t` sizes are near limits that could trigger slowdowns, given the problem constraints.
