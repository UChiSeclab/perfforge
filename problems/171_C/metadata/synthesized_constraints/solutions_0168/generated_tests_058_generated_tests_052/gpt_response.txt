### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Line-Level Hit Count Comparison:**
   - The `while` loop (Line 8) has significantly higher hit counts in the slow input (101 hits) compared to the fast input (4 hits).
   - Within the loop:
     - Line 10: Reading input `p` is hit 100 times for the slow input and 3 times for the fast input.
     - Line 11: Accumulating `sum` is hit 100 times for the slow input and 3 times for the fast input.
     - Line 12: Incrementing `count` is hit 100 times for the slow input and 3 times for the fast input.

2. **Inference on Line Interactions:**
   - The lines in question are within a loop that iterates based on the first input integer, `t`, which determines how many subsequent numbers are read.
   - The loop iterates `t` times, where `t` is the first number in the input sequence. The larger `t` is, the more iterations occur, leading to more operations and thus longer execution time.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **Natural Language Invariants:**

   - **Invariant 1:** "When the initial input number, `t`, is large (close to its maximum constraint of 100), the program performs many iterations, leading to extended computation time."
     - **Explanation:** The performance degradation primarily occurs due to the loop executing a number of times proportional to `t`, which directly impacts the operations performed within the loop.

   - **Invariant 2:** "If the sequence of numbers following `t` (up to `t` numbers) are significantly large, the accumulation operation becomes costly due to the multiplication and addition in each iteration."
     - **Explanation:** Each element in the sequence contributes to the `sum` with increasing weight as `count` increments, thereby increasing the computational load if these numbers are large.

2. **Thresholds and Input Patterns:**

   - The slowdown is most noticeable when `t` approaches its upper limit (close to 100) due to the loop executing nearly 100 times.
   - Additionally, if the subsequent numbers are large, it exacerbates the cost of the `sum` calculation, as each iteration does a multiplication and an addition.

### Conclusion

The primary condition that triggers performance issues is when the first input, `t`, is large, causing many iterations in the loop. This is compounded when the elements being processed are large, increasing the cost of each operation within the loop. These conditions should be monitored to identify potential slowdowns when scaling inputs within the given constraints.

### Phase 3: Implement the Natural Language Invariants as C++ Checkers

Based on the performance-characterizing invariants derived earlier, here are the C++ checker implementations:

1. **Invariant Checker for Large `t`:**

   - **Purpose:** To detect when `t` is large, which directly increases the number of loop iterations and leads to performance bottlenecks.
   
   ```cpp
   void check_large_t_invariant(int t) {
       if (t > 90) { // Threshold close to the upper constraint of 100
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large number of iterations due to t!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Invariant Checker for Large Values in Subsequent Inputs:**

   - **Purpose:** To detect if subsequent inputs are large, increasing the computational load during the loop iterations.
   
   ```cpp
   void check_large_values_invariant(int p) {
       if (p > 900) { // Arbitrary high value to indicate computational increase
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large values in input sequence!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Integrate the Checkers into the Original Program

Now, let's integrate these checkers into the original C++ program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Checker for large t, indicating many iterations
void check_large_t_invariant(int t) {
    if (t > 90) { // Threshold close to the upper constraint of 100
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large number of iterations due to t!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Checker for large values in input sequence
void check_large_values_invariant(int p) {
    if (p > 900) { // Arbitrary high value to indicate computational increase
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large values in input sequence!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    int t;
    cin >> t;
    check_large_t_invariant(t); // Check after reading t

    int count = 1;
    long long int sum = 0;
    while (t--) {
        int p;
        cin >> p;
        check_large_values_invariant(p); // Check for each value of p

        sum += count * p;
        count++;
    }
    cout << sum << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of Integration

- **Check for Large `t`:** After reading the initial integer `t`, we immediately check if it is large enough to indicate potential performance issues due to the number of iterations.
  
- **Check for Large `p`:** Each value `p` read from input is checked. If it is unusually large, it is flagged as potentially leading to a high computational cost when accumulating the sum.

These checks help identify scenarios that may lead to slow performance, allowing for early detection and aborting of the program before the bottleneck manifests significantly.
