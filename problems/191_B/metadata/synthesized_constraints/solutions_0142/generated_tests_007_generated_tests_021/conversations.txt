system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

In the capital city of Berland, Bertown, demonstrations are against the recent election of the King of Berland. Berland opposition, led by Mr. Ovalny, believes that the elections were not fair enough and wants to organize a demonstration at one of the squares.

Bertown has n squares, numbered from 1 to n, they are numbered in the order of increasing distance between them and the city center. That is, square number 1 is central, and square number n is the farthest from the center. Naturally, the opposition wants to hold a meeting as close to the city center as possible (that is, they want an square with the minimum number).

There are exactly k (k < n) days left before the demonstration. Now all squares are free. But the Bertown city administration never sleeps, and the approval of an application for the demonstration threatens to become a very complex process. The process of approval lasts several days, but every day the following procedure takes place:

  * The opposition shall apply to hold a demonstration at a free square (the one which isn't used by the administration). 
  * The administration tries to move the demonstration to the worst free square left. To do this, the administration organizes some long-term activities on the square, which is specified in the application of opposition. In other words, the administration starts using the square and it is no longer free. Then the administration proposes to move the opposition demonstration to the worst free square. If the opposition has applied for the worst free square then request is accepted and administration doesn't spend money. If the administration does not have enough money to organize an event on the square in question, the opposition's application is accepted. If administration doesn't have enough money to organize activity, then rest of administration's money spends and application is accepted 
  * If the application is not accepted, then the opposition can agree to the administration's proposal (that is, take the worst free square), or withdraw the current application and submit another one the next day. If there are no more days left before the meeting, the opposition has no choice but to agree to the proposal of City Hall. If application is accepted opposition can reject it. It means than opposition still can submit more applications later, but square remains free. 



In order to organize an event on the square i, the administration needs to spend ai bourles. Because of the crisis the administration has only b bourles to confront the opposition. What is the best square that the opposition can take, if the administration will keep trying to occupy the square in question each time? Note that the administration's actions always depend only on the actions of the opposition.

Input

The first line contains two integers n and k — the number of squares and days left before the meeting, correspondingly (1 ≤ k < n ≤ 105).

The second line contains a single integer b — the number of bourles the administration has (1 ≤ b ≤ 1018).

The third line contains n space-separated integers ai — the sum of money, needed to organise an event on square i (1 ≤ ai ≤ 109).

Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.

Output

Print a single number — the minimum number of the square where the opposition can organize the demonstration.

Note

In the first sample the opposition can act like this. On day one it applies for square 3. The administration has to organize an event there and end up with 3 bourles. If on the second day the opposition applies for square 2, the administration won't have the money to intervene.

In the second sample the opposition has only the chance for the last square. If its first move occupies one of the first four squares, the administration is left with at least 4 bourles, which means that next day it can use its next move to move the opposition from any square to the last one.

In the third sample administration has a lot of money, so opposition can occupy only last square.

assistant: ## Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

### Analysis of Hit Counts:
1. **Line 9**: In the slow input, this line is executed 25 times compared to 9 times in the fast input. This suggests the loop iterates significantly more often for the slow input.
2. **Line 11**: The loop starting here executes 75 times in the slow input but only once in the fast input. This indicates that a considerable amount of time is spent in this loop for the slow input.
3. **Line 12**: The condition check inside the loop at line 11 is evaluated 74 times in the slow input but not at all in the fast input. This shows that the condition "s + a[i].first > b" frequently holds true for the slow input.
4. **Line 15**: This nested loop executes 26 times in the slow input but not at all in the fast input, indicating additional processing related to the condition being true at line 14.

### Interaction with Data Structures:
- The use of the vector `a` in loops and conditions suggests that the operations performed on it contribute to the slowdown. Sorting and iterative checks against `b` appear to be a bottleneck given the increased processing for indices beyond `k`.

## Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the analysis, here are natural language performance invariants that describe conditions leading to slow execution:

1. **Large Set of Active Comparisons with `b`:** 
   - "When `k` is significantly smaller than `n`, resulting in many iterations of checking whether the sum of selected squares exceeds the budget `b`, performance may degrade due to repeated comparisons and potential adjustments of the answer."

2. **Frequent Adjustments in Large Arrays:**
   - "If there are many squares with costs slightly smaller or larger than the current sum, causing multiple adjustments to the answer within nested loops, the processing time can increase significantly."

3. **High Sorting Overhead:**
   - "Sorting becomes a performance bottleneck when the size of the list `a` is large, particularly when the top `k-1` elements frequently require re-evaluation against the threshold `b`."

4. **Nested Loops with Conditional Checks:**
   - "Performance may degrade when multiple nested loops perform conditional checks on large datasets, especially when those conditions consistently evaluate to true."

These invariants capture scenarios where the structure and behavior of the input data cause the program to execute more steps than necessary, particularly through repetitive checks and adjustments based on the financial constraint `b` and the number of days `k`. The constraints `n <= 100` and `1 ≤ k < n` suggest that the potential for slowdowns is more pronounced when `k` is much less than `n`, leading to increased processing steps and conditional evaluations.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
In the capital city of Berland, Bertown, demonstrations are against the recent election of the King of Berland. Berland opposition, led by Mr. Ovalny, believes that the elections were not fair enough and wants to organize a demonstration at one of the squares.

Bertown has n squares, numbered from 1 to n, they are numbered in the order of increasing distance between them and the city center. That is, square number 1 is central, and square number n is the farthest from the center. Naturally, the opposition wants to hold a meeting as close to the city center as possible (that is, they want an square with the minimum number).

There are exactly k (k < n) days left before the demonstration. Now all squares are free. But the Bertown city administration never sleeps, and the approval of an application for the demonstration threatens to become a very complex process. The process of approval lasts several days, but every day the following procedure takes place:

  * The opposition shall apply to hold a demonstration at a free square (the one which isn't used by the administration). 
  * The administration tries to move the demonstration to the worst free square left. To do this, the administration organizes some long-term activities on the square, which is specified in the application of opposition. In other words, the administration starts using the square and it is no longer free. Then the administration proposes to move the opposition demonstration to the worst free square. If the opposition has applied for the worst free square then request is accepted and administration doesn't spend money. If the administration does not have enough money to organize an event on the square in question, the opposition's application is accepted. If administration doesn't have enough money to organize activity, then rest of administration's money spends and application is accepted 
  * If the application is not accepted, then the opposition can agree to the administration's proposal (that is, take the worst free square), or withdraw the current application and submit another one the next day. If there are no more days left before the meeting, the opposition has no choice but to agree to the proposal of City Hall. If application is accepted opposition can reject it. It means than opposition still can submit more applications later, but square remains free. 



In order to organize an event on the square i, the administration needs to spend ai bourles. Because of the crisis the administration has only b bourles to confront the opposition. What is the best square that the opposition can take, if the administration will keep trying to occupy the square in question each time? Note that the administration's actions always depend only on the actions of the opposition.

Input

The first line contains two integers n and k — the number of squares and days left before the meeting, correspondingly (1 ≤ k < n ≤ 105).

The second line contains a single integer b — the number of bourles the administration has (1 ≤ b ≤ 1018).

The third line contains n space-separated integers ai — the sum of money, needed to organise an event on square i (1 ≤ ai ≤ 109).

Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.

Output

Print a single number — the minimum number of the square where the opposition can organize the demonstration.

Note

In the first sample the opposition can act like this. On day one it applies for square 3. The administration has to organize an event there and end up with 3 bourles. If on the second day the opposition applies for square 2, the administration won't have the money to intervene.

In the second sample the opposition has only the chance for the last square. If its first move occupies one of the first four squares, the administration is left with at least 4 bourles, which means that next day it can use its next move to move the opposition from any square to the last one.

In the third sample administration has a lot of money, so opposition can occupy only last square.

Solution (C++ code):
{solution}


assistant: ## Phase 3: Implement the Natural Language Invariants as Checker Code in C++

Below are the C++ code snippets implementing the performance-characterizing invariants derived previously. Each snippet checks for a specific condition that could lead to performance degradation based on the analysis from Phase 2.

### Checker Code Snippets

1. **Large Set of Active Comparisons with `b`:**
   - Checks if `k` is much smaller compared to `n`, which results in many iterations and potential slowdowns.
   
```cpp
void check_comparison_invariant(long long n, long long k) {
    if (n > 10 * k) {  // Assuming n being more than 10 times k indicates potential performance issue
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive comparisons due to large n relative to k!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

2. **Frequent Adjustments in Large Arrays:**
   - Detects when multiple conditions within loops frequently evaluate to true, causing many adjustments.
   
```cpp
void check_adjustment_invariant(long long s, long long b, long long ai) {
    if (s + ai > b && s + ai < b + 1000) {  // Adjusted threshold to detect frequent near-limit adjustments
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - frequent adjustments due to frequent near-limit comparisons!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

3. **High Sorting Overhead:**
   - Identifies when sorting large lists becomes a bottleneck.
   
```cpp
void check_sorting_invariant(long long n) {
    if (n > 10000) {  // Threshold based on problem constraints
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - potential excessive sorting operations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

4. **Nested Loops with Conditional Checks:**
   - Checks for nested loops that frequently enter conditionally true paths.
   
```cpp
void check_nested_loop_invariant(long long k, long long n) {
    if (k < n / 10) {  // Threshold indicating potential for performance issues with nested loops
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - potentially excessive nested loop iterations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

## Phase 4: Integrate Checker Code into the Program

Below is the original program, now instrumented with the checker functions. These functions are placed strategically to check for potential bottlenecks without adding overhead in tight loops.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Checker functions
void check_comparison_invariant(long long n, long long k) {
    if (n > 10 * k) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive comparisons due to large n relative to k!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_adjustment_invariant(long long s, long long b, long long ai) {
    if (s + ai > b && s + ai < b + 1000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - frequent adjustments due to frequent near-limit comparisons!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_sorting_invariant(long long n) {
    if (n > 10000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - potential excessive sorting operations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_nested_loop_invariant(long long k, long long n) {
    if (k < n / 10) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - potentially excessive nested loop iterations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

long long n, k, b, s, ans;

int main() {
    cin >> n >> k >> b;
    
    // Perform invariant checks
    check_comparison_invariant(n, k);
    check_sorting_invariant(n);
    check_nested_loop_invariant(k, n);

    vector<pair<long long, long long>> a(n - 1);
    for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) cin >> a[i].first, a[i].second = i;

    sort(a.rbegin(), a.rend());

    for (int i = 0; i < k - 1; i++) s += a[i].first;

    ans = n - 1;
    for (int i = k; i < n - 1; i++) {
        check_adjustment_invariant(s, b, a[i].first);
        if (s + a[i].first > b) ans = min(ans, a[i].second);
    }

    s += a[k - 1].first;
    if (s > b)
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) ans = min(ans, a[i].second);

    cout << ans + 1;
}
```

### Explanation of Inserted Checks:
- **`check_comparison_invariant`**: Placed after reading inputs to detect high `n` relative to `k`.
- **`check_sorting_invariant`**: Before sorting to catch potential sorting overhead due to large `n`.
- **`check_nested_loop_invariant`**: After reading inputs, checking potential nested loop performance issues.
- **`check_adjustment_invariant`**: Inside the loop to catch frequent adjustments close to the budget `b`.

These checks are designed to help identify scenarios where the program could experience significant slowdowns, offering useful insight during testing and fuzzing processes.
