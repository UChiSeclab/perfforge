system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

In the capital city of Berland, Bertown, demonstrations are against the recent election of the King of Berland. Berland opposition, led by Mr. Ovalny, believes that the elections were not fair enough and wants to organize a demonstration at one of the squares.

Bertown has n squares, numbered from 1 to n, they are numbered in the order of increasing distance between them and the city center. That is, square number 1 is central, and square number n is the farthest from the center. Naturally, the opposition wants to hold a meeting as close to the city center as possible (that is, they want an square with the minimum number).

There are exactly k (k < n) days left before the demonstration. Now all squares are free. But the Bertown city administration never sleeps, and the approval of an application for the demonstration threatens to become a very complex process. The process of approval lasts several days, but every day the following procedure takes place:

  * The opposition shall apply to hold a demonstration at a free square (the one which isn't used by the administration). 
  * The administration tries to move the demonstration to the worst free square left. To do this, the administration organizes some long-term activities on the square, which is specified in the application of opposition. In other words, the administration starts using the square and it is no longer free. Then the administration proposes to move the opposition demonstration to the worst free square. If the opposition has applied for the worst free square then request is accepted and administration doesn't spend money. If the administration does not have enough money to organize an event on the square in question, the opposition's application is accepted. If administration doesn't have enough money to organize activity, then rest of administration's money spends and application is accepted 
  * If the application is not accepted, then the opposition can agree to the administration's proposal (that is, take the worst free square), or withdraw the current application and submit another one the next day. If there are no more days left before the meeting, the opposition has no choice but to agree to the proposal of City Hall. If application is accepted opposition can reject it. It means than opposition still can submit more applications later, but square remains free. 



In order to organize an event on the square i, the administration needs to spend ai bourles. Because of the crisis the administration has only b bourles to confront the opposition. What is the best square that the opposition can take, if the administration will keep trying to occupy the square in question each time? Note that the administration's actions always depend only on the actions of the opposition.

Input

The first line contains two integers n and k — the number of squares and days left before the meeting, correspondingly (1 ≤ k < n ≤ 105).

The second line contains a single integer b — the number of bourles the administration has (1 ≤ b ≤ 1018).

The third line contains n space-separated integers ai — the sum of money, needed to organise an event on square i (1 ≤ ai ≤ 109).

Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.

Output

Print a single number — the minimum number of the square where the opposition can organize the demonstration.

Note

In the first sample the opposition can act like this. On day one it applies for square 3. The administration has to organize an event there and end up with 3 bourles. If on the second day the opposition applies for square 2, the administration won't have the money to intervene.

In the second sample the opposition has only the chance for the last square. If its first move occupies one of the first four squares, the administration is left with at least 4 bourles, which means that next day it can use its next move to move the opposition from any square to the last one.

In the third sample administration has a lot of money, so opposition can occupy only last square.

assistant: To analyze and diagnose the performance bottlenecks in the provided C++ code, we will follow a structured approach:

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Compare Line-Level Hit Counts:**
   - The `slow_hit_count` for these lines is significantly higher compared to `fast_hit_count`:
     - **Lines 23-26:** This loop is executed multiple times for the slow input, indicating heavy use of operations with `multiset` `q`.
     - **Lines 32-54:** This block, which includes two major while loops and multiple conditional checks, is executed repeatedly in the slow run but not at all in the fast run.
   
2. **Pinpoint Lines with More Hits under Slow Input:**
   - **While Loop (Line 23):** Adjusts the size of set `q` until it reaches `k`. This loop's operations on `q` and `p` are critical because they involve costly insert, erase, and minimum operations on these data structures.
   - **For Loop (Line 32):** Continuously adjusts the sets `p` and `q` each iteration, which involves multiple checks and operations that are repeatedly hit in the slow input.

3. **Infer Interaction with Data Structures:**
   - The `multiset` operations are central to this performance issue. The code relies on manipulating `multiset` `q` and `p` to keep track of which squares are affordable. These operations become expensive when the input has specific characteristics leading to more iterations and operations.
   - The repeated comparison and manipulations within these loops suggest that the performance bottleneck is heavily influenced by the logic governing the reassignment of squares and budget checks.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **Natural Language Statements for Slowdown Conditions:**
   
   - **Invariant #1: Multiset Manipulations:** 
     "The program slows down significantly when the `multiset` operations (insert, erase, find) on sets `p` and `q` are invoked repeatedly within loops, especially when the number of such operations approaches or exceeds the number of days `k` or squares `n`."

   - **Invariant #2: Conditional and Iterative Complexity:**
     "When the iterative process of adjusting and checking the budget across multiple squares (`n`) interacts with constraints that require continuous re-evaluation of set operations, the performance degrades. This is particularly noticeable when the available budget `b` is just enough to require multiple reassignments and recalculations."

   - **Invariant #3: Budget Constraints and Distribution:**
     "If the distribution of the cost of squares `a[i]` leads to nearly equivalent or just barely varying costs that cause frequent switchovers between sets `p` and `q`, significant slowdowns occur. This happens when the budget `b` is enough so that the administration can afford operations close to `k` times before exhausting its funds."

2. **Threshold Values Aligning with Problem Constraints:**
   - Given the constraint `n <= 100`, the program's slowdown is more likely when day count `k` is large relative to `n` and budget `b` is substantial enough to allow multiple cycles of the main loop without immediate termination.

3. **Future Scenarios:**
   - These conditions could lead to a slowdown in the future when the input exhibits similar characteristics: sizable `k` relative to `n` and `b`, with a cost array `a[i]` that causes many conditional operations on `p` and `q`.

These natural language invariants help to identify scenarios and input patterns that could lead to performance bottlenecks, guiding future optimizations and debugging tasks.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
In the capital city of Berland, Bertown, demonstrations are against the recent election of the King of Berland. Berland opposition, led by Mr. Ovalny, believes that the elections were not fair enough and wants to organize a demonstration at one of the squares.

Bertown has n squares, numbered from 1 to n, they are numbered in the order of increasing distance between them and the city center. That is, square number 1 is central, and square number n is the farthest from the center. Naturally, the opposition wants to hold a meeting as close to the city center as possible (that is, they want an square with the minimum number).

There are exactly k (k < n) days left before the demonstration. Now all squares are free. But the Bertown city administration never sleeps, and the approval of an application for the demonstration threatens to become a very complex process. The process of approval lasts several days, but every day the following procedure takes place:

  * The opposition shall apply to hold a demonstration at a free square (the one which isn't used by the administration). 
  * The administration tries to move the demonstration to the worst free square left. To do this, the administration organizes some long-term activities on the square, which is specified in the application of opposition. In other words, the administration starts using the square and it is no longer free. Then the administration proposes to move the opposition demonstration to the worst free square. If the opposition has applied for the worst free square then request is accepted and administration doesn't spend money. If the administration does not have enough money to organize an event on the square in question, the opposition's application is accepted. If administration doesn't have enough money to organize activity, then rest of administration's money spends and application is accepted 
  * If the application is not accepted, then the opposition can agree to the administration's proposal (that is, take the worst free square), or withdraw the current application and submit another one the next day. If there are no more days left before the meeting, the opposition has no choice but to agree to the proposal of City Hall. If application is accepted opposition can reject it. It means than opposition still can submit more applications later, but square remains free. 



In order to organize an event on the square i, the administration needs to spend ai bourles. Because of the crisis the administration has only b bourles to confront the opposition. What is the best square that the opposition can take, if the administration will keep trying to occupy the square in question each time? Note that the administration's actions always depend only on the actions of the opposition.

Input

The first line contains two integers n and k — the number of squares and days left before the meeting, correspondingly (1 ≤ k < n ≤ 105).

The second line contains a single integer b — the number of bourles the administration has (1 ≤ b ≤ 1018).

The third line contains n space-separated integers ai — the sum of money, needed to organise an event on square i (1 ≤ ai ≤ 109).

Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.

Output

Print a single number — the minimum number of the square where the opposition can organize the demonstration.

Note

In the first sample the opposition can act like this. On day one it applies for square 3. The administration has to organize an event there and end up with 3 bourles. If on the second day the opposition applies for square 2, the administration won't have the money to intervene.

In the second sample the opposition has only the chance for the last square. If its first move occupies one of the first four squares, the administration is left with at least 4 bourles, which means that next day it can use its next move to move the opposition from any square to the last one.

In the third sample administration has a lot of money, so opposition can occupy only last square.

assistant: ### Phase 3: Implement the Natural Language Invariants in C++

Here are the C++ code snippets implementing the performance-characterizing invariants derived in natural language:

1. **Invariant #1: Multiset Manipulations**
   ```cpp
   void check_multiset_operations(int q_size, int k) {
       if (q_size == k) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck triggered by excessive multiset operations!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Invariant #2: Conditional and Iterative Complexity**
   ```cpp
   void check_iteration_complexity(int i, long long S, long long b) {
       if (i > 0 && S > b) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to high iterative complexity!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Invariant #3: Budget Constraints and Distribution**
   ```cpp
   void check_budget_constraints(long long remaining_budget, int iteration_count) {
       if (remaining_budget < 10000 && iteration_count > 50) { // Example thresholds
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to tight budget constraints!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Integrate Conditional Checks into the Original Program

Let's integrate these checks into the original C++ program at effective points in the control flow:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

void check_multiset_operations(int q_size, int k) {
    if (q_size == k) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck triggered by excessive multiset operations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_iteration_complexity(int i, long long S, long long b) {
    if (i > 0 && S > b) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to high iterative complexity!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_budget_constraints(long long remaining_budget, int iteration_count) {
    if (remaining_budget < 10000 && iteration_count > 50) { // Example thresholds
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to tight budget constraints!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    int n, k;
    cin >> n >> k;
    k--;
    long long b;
    cin >> b;
    vector<long long> a(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) cin >> a[i];
    
    n--;
    long long S = 0;
    multiset<long long> p, q;
    
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        q.insert(a[i]);
        S += a[i];
    }
    
    while (((int)(q).size()) != k) {
        S -= *q.begin();
        p.insert(*q.begin());
        q.erase(q.begin());
    }
    
    // Insert check for first invariant
    check_multiset_operations((int)q.size(), k);
    
    // Insert check for second invariant
    check_iteration_complexity(0, S + a[0], b);
    
    if (S + a[0] > b) {
        cout << 1 << endl;
        return 0;
    }
    
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        if (q.find(a[i]) != q.end()) {
            S -= a[i];
            q.erase(q.find(a[i]));
        } else {
            p.erase(p.find(a[i]));
        }
        
        if (((int)(p).size()) == 0 || a[i - 1] >= *p.rbegin()) {
            S += a[i - 1];
            q.insert(a[i - 1]);
        }
        
        while (((int)(q).size()) > k) {
            S -= *q.begin();
            p.insert(*q.begin());
            q.erase(q.begin());
        }
        
        while (((int)(q).size()) < k) {
            long long tmp = *p.rbegin();
            S += tmp;
            p.erase(p.find(tmp));
            q.insert(tmp);
        }
        
        // Insert check for second invariant within the loop
        check_iteration_complexity(i, S + a[i], b);
        
        if (S + a[i] > b) {
            cout << i + 1 << endl;
            return 0;
        }
    }
    
    // Insert final check for budget constraints before exiting
    check_budget_constraints(b - S, n);
    
    cout << n + 1 << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

**Comments on Inserted Checks:**
- **`check_multiset_operations`:** This check is placed after the while loop that adjusts the multiset's size to ensure we don't enter a costly state.
- **`check_iteration_complexity`:** Placed both before entering the loop and inside the loop to catch excessive iteration complexity early.
- **`check_budget_constraints`:** Added towards the end of the function to ensure that the budget constraints don't lead to excessive re-computation.
