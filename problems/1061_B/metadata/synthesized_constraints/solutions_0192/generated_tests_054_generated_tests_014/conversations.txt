system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

You came to the exhibition and one exhibit has drawn your attention. It consists of n stacks of blocks, where the i-th stack consists of a_i blocks resting on the surface.

The height of the exhibit is equal to m. Consequently, the number of blocks in each stack is less than or equal to m.

There is a camera on the ceiling that sees the top view of the blocks and a camera on the right wall that sees the side view of the blocks.

<image>

Find the maximum number of blocks you can remove such that the views for both the cameras would not change.

Note, that while originally all blocks are stacked on the floor, it is not required for them to stay connected to the floor after some blocks are removed. There is no gravity in the whole exhibition, so no block would fall down, even if the block underneath is removed. It is not allowed to move blocks by hand either.

Input

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9) — the number of stacks and the height of the exhibit.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ m) — the number of blocks in each stack from left to right.

Output

Print exactly one integer — the maximum number of blocks that can be removed.

assistant: ### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Comparison of Line-Level Hit Counts**:
   - The loop starting at line 8 is executed 100 times for the slow input and only once for the fast input.
   - The loop starting at line 20 is also executed 100 times for the slow input and not executed at all for the fast input.
   - Lines 21 and 22 are hit 100 times under the slow input scenario.

2. **Pinpointing Inefficiencies**:
   - The loop on line 20 iterates over `n` and repeatedly increases `ans` and `curr`. This loop execution is significant in the slow input and not triggered for the fast input due to the condition `vec.size() == 1`.
   - The sorting operation on line 13 is executed once in both fast and slow inputs but would generally be more expensive with larger `n`.

3. **Interaction with Data Structures**:
   - The `vec` vector is sorted, which is a potential bottleneck in general for large `n`.
   - The main bottleneck seems to be the loop on line 20, which repeatedly processes the elements in `vec`.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **Invariant 1**: 
   - **Natural Language Description**: “If the number of stacks `n` is large, the loop iterating over each stack may lead to a significant slow down, especially if `n` approaches its upper constraint.”
   - **Explanation**: This is because the loop on line 20 processes each element, and the operations inside contribute directly to the time complexity.

2. **Invariant 2**: 
   - **Natural Language Description**: “When the values in `vec` require significant increments in `curr` during the loop, this might indicate that the maximum possible blocks that can be removed are small, impacting efficiency.”
   - **Explanation**: The increment operation in `curr` involves checking each element and modifying the value, which can be a repeated expense when `vec[i] > curr`.

3. **Invariant 3**: 
   - **Natural Language Description**: “Sorting a large array `vec` before processing it can introduce overhead, especially when `n` is near its upper limit.”
   - **Explanation**: Although the sorting is done once, it can contribute heavily to the runtime complexity, particularly with larger input sizes.

### Output: Concise Set of Performance Invariants

1. **Invariant 1**: "If the number of stacks `n` approaches its maximum constraint, iterating over all stacks in the loop could significantly slow down the program."

2. **Invariant 2**: "When a large number of elements in `vec` are greater than current `curr` value, leading to repeated increments, it can slow down execution."

3. **Invariant 3**: "Sorting an array of stacks when `n` is large can introduce significant computational overhead, affecting performance."

These invariants help identify potential conditions leading to slowdowns without relying on the specifics of any single input. They focus on broad input conditions that can trigger performance issues.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
You came to the exhibition and one exhibit has drawn your attention. It consists of n stacks of blocks, where the i-th stack consists of a_i blocks resting on the surface.

The height of the exhibit is equal to m. Consequently, the number of blocks in each stack is less than or equal to m.

There is a camera on the ceiling that sees the top view of the blocks and a camera on the right wall that sees the side view of the blocks.

<image>

Find the maximum number of blocks you can remove such that the views for both the cameras would not change.

Note, that while originally all blocks are stacked on the floor, it is not required for them to stay connected to the floor after some blocks are removed. There is no gravity in the whole exhibition, so no block would fall down, even if the block underneath is removed. It is not allowed to move blocks by hand either.

Input

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9) — the number of stacks and the height of the exhibit.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ m) — the number of blocks in each stack from left to right.

Output

Print exactly one integer — the maximum number of blocks that can be removed.

assistant: ### Phase 3: Implement the Natural Language Invariants in C++

Here are the C++ checker functions based on the performance-characterizing invariants derived earlier:

1. **Checker for Invariant 1**: Checking the size of `n`.
```cpp
void check_large_n_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large n leading to heavy loop iteration!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

2. **Checker for Invariant 2**: Checking heavy increment operations in the loop.
```cpp
void check_heavy_increment_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - repeated increments in loop!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

3. **Checker for Invariant 3**: Checking potential large sorting overhead.
```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - sorting a large array!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrate Checker Code into the Original Program

Below is the modified program with integrated checker code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Checker for large n
void check_large_n_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large n leading to heavy loop iteration!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Checker for heavy increment operations in the loop
void check_heavy_increment_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - repeated increments in loop!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Checker for potential large sorting overhead
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - sorting a large array!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    long long int n, i, j, k, x, y, m, t;
    cin >> n >> m;
    vector<long long int> vec;
    long long int sm = 0;
    
    check_large_n_invariant(n > 50000); // Check if n is large enough to potentially cause slowdowns
    
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        cin >> j;
        vec.push_back(j);
        sm += j;
    }
    
    check_sort_invariant(n > 50000); // Check if sorting a large array could be a bottleneck
    sort(vec.begin(), vec.end());
    
    if (vec.size() == 1) {
        printf("0\n");
        return 0;
    }
    
    long long int ans = 0;
    long long int curr = 0;
    
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        ans += 1;
        check_heavy_increment_invariant(vec[i] > curr); // Check if repeated increments occur
        if (vec[i] > curr) curr++;
    }
    
    ans += max((long long int)0, vec[n - 1] - curr);
    cout << sm - ans << endl;
}
```

### Comments on Code Integration

1. **`check_large_n_invariant`**: Placed after input reading to check the size of `n`, ensuring that large values are detected early without impacting loop performance.

2. **`check_sort_invariant`**: Placed before sorting to assess potential slowdowns due to processing large arrays.

3. **`check_heavy_increment_invariant`**: Used within the loop to detect costly repeated increment operations, inserted smartly to minimize additional overhead.

These checkers help identify and alert potential bottlenecks in the program based on the invariants. They are designed to abort execution if conditions indicating significant slowdowns are met.
