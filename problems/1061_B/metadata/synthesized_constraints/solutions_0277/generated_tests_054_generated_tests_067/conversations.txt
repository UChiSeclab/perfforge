system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

You came to the exhibition and one exhibit has drawn your attention. It consists of n stacks of blocks, where the i-th stack consists of a_i blocks resting on the surface.

The height of the exhibit is equal to m. Consequently, the number of blocks in each stack is less than or equal to m.

There is a camera on the ceiling that sees the top view of the blocks and a camera on the right wall that sees the side view of the blocks.

<image>

Find the maximum number of blocks you can remove such that the views for both the cameras would not change.

Note, that while originally all blocks are stacked on the floor, it is not required for them to stay connected to the floor after some blocks are removed. There is no gravity in the whole exhibition, so no block would fall down, even if the block underneath is removed. It is not allowed to move blocks by hand either.

Input

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9) — the number of stacks and the height of the exhibit.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ m) — the number of blocks in each stack from left to right.

Output

Print exactly one integer — the maximum number of blocks that can be removed.

assistant: To diagnose the performance bottlenecks in the provided C program and derive conditions or invariants that characterize when the program enters a slow path, let's go through the specified tasks.

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

#### Analysis of Hit Counts
1. **Line 7**: The line reading input into the array `ar` is hit 101 times for the slow input and only 2 times for the fast input. This discrepancy is expected due to the difference in `n` values (100 vs. 1).
2. **Line 10**: The loop iterating from `n - 1` down to 1 is hit 100 times for the slow input versus 1 time for the fast input. This suggests that the loop is a primary contributor to the slowdown.
3. **Lines 11-13**: These lines inside the loop are executed 99 times for the slow input and 0 times for the fast input, indicating that they are the main source of work performed in the slow path.

#### Data Structures and Algorithmic Considerations
- The inner loop (lines 10-13) is performing arithmetic operations and comparisons, which inherently could be optimized by reducing unnecessary operations.
- The sorting operation in line 8 is executed once, but given that sorting is O(n log n), it could potentially contribute to the slowdown if `n` were much larger. However, this is not the main issue within the problem constraints (n ≤ 100).

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the above analysis, we can derive the following invariants:

1. **Invariant #1: High Loop Iterations with Conditional Arithmetic**
   - **Natural Language Description**: "If there is a large number of stacks (n is close to its upper bound) and each stack height varies significantly, the program may slow down due to the repeated arithmetic operations and conditional checks in the loop."
   - **Explanation**: The loop in lines 10-13 heightens in cost when `n` is large, causing each stack's height to be processed repeatedly. As `n` reaches its upper limit of 100, the cost compounds due to the multiple arithmetic and min operations.

2. **Invariant #2: Input Diversity Impact**
   - **Natural Language Description**: "When the stack heights (`ar[i]`) vary significantly and do not follow a descending pattern, the program performs more operations, especially in reducing `mx`, leading to a slowdown."
   - **Explanation**: If stack heights decrease significantly from the maximum, the line `mx = min(mx, ar[i])` constantly updates `mx` and forces the condition `if (mx > 0)` to frequently allow decrement and increment operations, lengthening execution time.

3. **Invariant #3: Sorting Overhead with Balanced Inputs**
   - **Natural Language Description**: "If the input stacks are all nearly equal and n is high, the sorting operation itself does not contribute much to the slowdown, but it sets up a costly loop due to similar stack heights allowing maximum decrements."
   - **Explanation**: Sorting large, similar values does not greatly affect the loop's performance, but the subsequent step where many decrements and increments are performed does, especially when stack heights allow for repeated decrements.

These invariants collectively cover the main performance risks given the problem constraints (n ≤ 100, m ≤ 10^9) without relying on specific input values. They are designed to help in identifying conditions that trigger slow paths in the algorithm.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
You came to the exhibition and one exhibit has drawn your attention. It consists of n stacks of blocks, where the i-th stack consists of a_i blocks resting on the surface.

The height of the exhibit is equal to m. Consequently, the number of blocks in each stack is less than or equal to m.

There is a camera on the ceiling that sees the top view of the blocks and a camera on the right wall that sees the side view of the blocks.

<image>

Find the maximum number of blocks you can remove such that the views for both the cameras would not change.

Note, that while originally all blocks are stacked on the floor, it is not required for them to stay connected to the floor after some blocks are removed. There is no gravity in the whole exhibition, so no block would fall down, even if the block underneath is removed. It is not allowed to move blocks by hand either.

Input

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9) — the number of stacks and the height of the exhibit.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ m) — the number of blocks in each stack from left to right.

Output

Print exactly one integer — the maximum number of blocks that can be removed.

assistant: ## Phase 3: Implementing the Natural Language Invariants as Checker Code in C++

Here, I will translate the performance-characterizing invariants into C++ runtime checks.

### Invariant #1: High Loop Iterations with Conditional Arithmetic

```cpp
void check_large_n_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to high number of stacks with variable heights!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Invariant #2: Input Diversity Impact

```cpp
void check_input_diversity_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to significant height variations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Invariant #3: Sorting Overhead with Balanced Inputs

```cpp
void check_balanced_inputs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to balanced stack heights causing maximum decrements!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

## Phase 4: Integrating the Checker Code into the Original Program

Now, I will integrate these checks into the C++ program at the appropriate locations to avoid adding overhead in tight loops while still capturing performance bottlenecks.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

const int N = 1e5 + 5;
long long n, m, ar[N], ans, mx, res[N];

// Checkers for performance invariants
void check_large_n_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to high number of stacks with variable heights!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_input_diversity_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to significant height variations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_balanced_inputs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to balanced stack heights causing maximum decrements!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    cin >> n >> m;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) scanf("%I64d", &ar[i]);

    // Check for potential performance bottlenecks before sorting
    check_large_n_invariant(n > 95); // example threshold close to the upper bound

    sort(ar + 1, ar + n + 1);

    // Check for input diversity impact after sorting
    check_input_diversity_invariant(ar[n] - ar[1] > m / 2); // significant variation threshold

    mx = ar[n] - 1;
    for (int i = n - 1; i >= 1; i--) {
        ans += ar[i] - 1;
        mx = min(mx, ar[i]);
        if (mx > 0) mx--, ans++;
    }

    // Check for balanced inputs causing maximum decrements
    check_balanced_inputs_invariant(mx == 0); // condition where all decrements are possible

    cout << ans << endl;
}
```

### Explanation of Checker Placement

1. **`check_large_n_invariant`** is placed right after reading the input to catch conditions where `n` is close to its maximum limit.

2. **`check_input_diversity_invariant`** runs after sorting to evaluate the diversity in stack heights. This check ensures we identify significant variations that could lead to increased operations.

3. **`check_balanced_inputs_invariant`** is placed after the loop to capture scenarios where the algorithm might have performed excessive operations due to balanced heights allowing maximum decrements. 

These checks are designed to abort the program execution if they detect potential performance bottlenecks, aiding in debugging and optimization efforts.
