system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

You came to the exhibition and one exhibit has drawn your attention. It consists of n stacks of blocks, where the i-th stack consists of a_i blocks resting on the surface.

The height of the exhibit is equal to m. Consequently, the number of blocks in each stack is less than or equal to m.

There is a camera on the ceiling that sees the top view of the blocks and a camera on the right wall that sees the side view of the blocks.

<image>

Find the maximum number of blocks you can remove such that the views for both the cameras would not change.

Note, that while originally all blocks are stacked on the floor, it is not required for them to stay connected to the floor after some blocks are removed. There is no gravity in the whole exhibition, so no block would fall down, even if the block underneath is removed. It is not allowed to move blocks by hand either.

Input

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9) — the number of stacks and the height of the exhibit.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ m) — the number of blocks in each stack from left to right.

Output

Print exactly one integer — the maximum number of blocks that can be removed.

assistant: ### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Comparison of Line-level Hit Counts**:
   - Lines 9-13 have significantly higher hit counts in the slow run compared to the fast run. This is expected as they correspond to a loop that iterates over each stack (n times).
   - The `while` loop starting at line 20 is not entered in the fast input case but is executed many times for the slow input.

2. **Pinpointing Lines with More Hits**:
   - **Loop (lines 20-25)**: This loop is executed multiple times (99 times) in the slow run, which results in repeatedly searching and erasing elements from a multiset. The operations performed here are potentially expensive due to the nature of the multiset operations, particularly if many elements need to be processed.

3. **Inference on Data Structures and Loop Interactions**:
   - The use of `multiset<long long> S` and operations like `S.lower_bound(pos)` and `S.erase(it)` inside a `while` loop suggest that the performance bottleneck may arise from these operations, especially if the multiset is large.
   - The `lower_bound` operation is logarithmic, but repeated operations can still lead to inefficiency if `n` is large.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **Natural Language Statements**:

   - **Invariant 1**: "If the number of stacks `n` is large, and many elements in the multiset have values close to each other, the repeated search and erase operations within the while-loop can degrade performance."
     - **Explanation**: This invariant reflects the high hit counts in the `while` loop, which suggests inefficiency due to repeated multiset operations, especially when values are densely packed around the same range.

   - **Invariant 2**: "If the maximum block height `maxi` is large compared to the average stack size, the loop may iterate many times, resulting in slower execution."
     - **Explanation**: The loop continues until `pos` exceeds `maxi`, so a larger `maxi` implies more iterations, which can significantly affect performance when combined with multiset operations.

2. **Avoidance of Exact Values**:
   - The inferences focus on conditions such as the relative sizes and distributions of `n` and stack heights rather than specific values from the slow input.

3. **Correlation with Input Patterns**:
   - These conditions are related to how densely packed stacks lead to more intense processing in the `while` loop, and how maximum heights affect the iterations.

4. **Considerations for Future Slow Scenarios**:
   - The invariants are broad enough to account for new inputs with similar characteristics, ensuring that similar performance issues can be anticipated and potentially mitigated.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
You came to the exhibition and one exhibit has drawn your attention. It consists of n stacks of blocks, where the i-th stack consists of a_i blocks resting on the surface.

The height of the exhibit is equal to m. Consequently, the number of blocks in each stack is less than or equal to m.

There is a camera on the ceiling that sees the top view of the blocks and a camera on the right wall that sees the side view of the blocks.

<image>

Find the maximum number of blocks you can remove such that the views for both the cameras would not change.

Note, that while originally all blocks are stacked on the floor, it is not required for them to stay connected to the floor after some blocks are removed. There is no gravity in the whole exhibition, so no block would fall down, even if the block underneath is removed. It is not allowed to move blocks by hand either.

Input

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9) — the number of stacks and the height of the exhibit.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ m) — the number of blocks in each stack from left to right.

Output

Print exactly one integer — the maximum number of blocks that can be removed.

assistant: ### Phase 3: Implementing Invariants as Checker Code in C++

Based on the performance-characterizing invariants identified, let's implement the corresponding checker code in C++:

**Invariant 1**: "If the number of stacks `n` is large, and many elements in the multiset have values close to each other, the repeated search and erase operations within the while-loop can degrade performance."

**Checker Code**:
```cpp
void check_multiset_invariant(const std::multiset<long long>& S, long long n, long long maxi) {
    // Check if the multiset is dense (many similar values) and n is large
    if (S.size() > 10000 && n > 5000) {
        std::cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - dense multiset with large n" << std::endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

**Invariant 2**: "If the maximum block height `maxi` is large compared to the average stack size, the loop may iterate many times, resulting in slower execution."

**Checker Code**:
```cpp
void check_maxi_invariant(long long maxi, long long averageHeight) {
    // Check if maxi is significantly larger than the average height (indicative of potential slow path)
    if (maxi > 2 * averageHeight) {
        std::cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high maximum height compared to average" << std::endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrating Checkers into the Original Program

Below is the instrumented C++ code with the integrated checker functions:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
long long a[100005];

void check_multiset_invariant(const std::multiset<long long>& S, long long n, long long maxi) {
    // Check if the multiset is dense (many similar values) and n is large
    if (S.size() > 10000 && n > 5000) {
        std::cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - dense multiset with large n" << std::endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_maxi_invariant(long long maxi, long long averageHeight) {
    // Check if maxi is significantly larger than the average height (indicative of potential slow path)
    if (maxi > 2 * averageHeight) {
        std::cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high maximum height compared to average" << std::endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    long long n, m;
    scanf("%lld %lld", &n, &m);
    multiset<long long> S;
    long long maxi = 0, sum = 0;
    for (long long i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        scanf("%lld", &a[i]);
        S.insert(a[i]);
        maxi = max(maxi, a[i]);
        sum += a[i];
    }

    // Calculate average height for invariant check
    long long averageHeight = sum / n;

    // Insert checkers after input processing
    check_multiset_invariant(S, n, maxi);  // Detects dense multisets with large n
    check_maxi_invariant(maxi, averageHeight);  // Detects high maxi compared to average

    if (n == 1 || maxi == 1) {
        printf("0\n");
        return 0;

### Explanation 
- **Checker Placement**: The checkers are placed immediately after the initial setup and input reading to avoid adding overhead during tight loops.
- **Checkers Utility**: They provide early detection of potential performance issues by examining the characteristics of the input data and data structures used. These checks are designed to help detect conditions that could lead to excessive computations or inefficient paths, thus aiding in performance debugging and optimization.
