system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

Ann and Borya have n piles with candies and n is even number. There are ai candies in pile with number i.

Ann likes numbers which are square of some integer and Borya doesn't like numbers which are square of any integer. During one move guys can select some pile with candies and add one candy to it (this candy is new and doesn't belong to any other pile) or remove one candy (if there is at least one candy in this pile). 

Find out minimal number of moves that is required to make exactly n / 2 piles contain number of candies that is a square of some integer and exactly n / 2 piles contain number of candies that is not a square of any integer.

Input

First line contains one even integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 200 000) — number of piles with candies.

Second line contains sequence of integers a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 109) — amounts of candies in each pile.

Output

Output minimal number of steps required to make exactly n / 2 piles contain number of candies that is a square of some integer and exactly n / 2 piles contain number of candies that is not a square of any integer. If condition is already satisfied output 0.

Note

In first example you can satisfy condition in two moves. During each move you should add one candy to second pile. After it size of second pile becomes 16. After that Borya and Ann will have two piles with number of candies which is a square of integer (second and fourth pile) and two piles with number of candies which is not a square of any integer (first and third pile).

In second example you should add two candies to any three piles.

assistant: ### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

By comparing line-level hit counts between the fast and slow inputs, we can identify potential bottlenecks causing slow execution:

1. **Main Loop (Line 9-10):** 
   - **Observation:** This loop iterates `n` times, and the line inside it (Line 10) is executed 100 times for the slow input but only 4 times for the fast input.
   - **Inference:** This loop is being executed significantly more often in the slow input, suggesting that this part of the code may be handling more complex or numerous operations depending on the input characteristics.

2. **Condition Check and Vector Filling (Line 15-18):**
   - **Observation:** Line 15 is hit once in the slow input, and the loop at Line 16 iterates over all elements again. Line 18 shows a hit count of 78, indicating that a substantial number of elements in the slow input match the condition being checked.
   - **Inference:** This reflects that the slow input has many elements where the number of candies is already a perfect square, necessitating additional operations to balance the count of piles with non-square numbers.

3. **Sorting and Summation (Line 19-21):**
   - **Observation:** The vector is sorted, and a summation loop runs for 29 iterations on the slow input.
   - **Inference:** Sorting a vector and iterating over it to calculate a sum can be computationally expensive, especially when repeated for many elements.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

From the analysis, we can derive the following performance-characterizing invariants:

1. **High Count of Perfect Squares:**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "If a large number of piles already contain a perfect square number of candies, the program may perform extensive operations to balance the pile counts. This is likely because the ratio of square to non-square piles is significantly skewed."
   - **Condition:** This scenario arises when there are considerably more than n/2 piles with perfect square candies, triggering repeated checks and operations.

2. **Repeated Sorting and Summation:**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "When the program frequently needs to sort an array of differences and sum a substantial number of elements to adjust pile counts, performance may degrade."
   - **Condition:** If the number of operations done in sorting and summing becomes large due to imbalance, it signifies a performance hit.

3. **Imbalance in Initial State:**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "The program experiences slowdown when the initial distribution of square and non-square piles is highly imbalanced, requiring many operations to achieve the desired balance."
   - **Condition:** Significant imbalance at the start results in repeated operations to match the required n/2 distribution.

These invariants highlight the input characteristics and operations that can lead to slow execution, helping diagnose and potentially optimize the code for similar future inputs.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
Ann and Borya have n piles with candies and n is even number. There are ai candies in pile with number i.

Ann likes numbers which are square of some integer and Borya doesn't like numbers which are square of any integer. During one move guys can select some pile with candies and add one candy to it (this candy is new and doesn't belong to any other pile) or remove one candy (if there is at least one candy in this pile). 

Find out minimal number of moves that is required to make exactly n / 2 piles contain number of candies that is a square of some integer and exactly n / 2 piles contain number of candies that is not a square of any integer.

Input

First line contains one even integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 200 000) — number of piles with candies.

Second line contains sequence of integers a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 109) — amounts of candies in each pile.

Output

Output minimal number of steps required to make exactly n / 2 piles contain number of candies that is a square of some integer and exactly n / 2 piles contain number of candies that is not a square of any integer. If condition is already satisfied output 0.

Note

In first example you can satisfy condition in two moves. During each move you should add one candy to second pile. After it size of second pile becomes 16. After that Borya and Ann will have two piles with number of candies which is a square of integer (second and fourth pile) and two piles with number of candies which is not a square of any integer (first and third pile).

In second example you should add two candies to any three piles.

Solution (C++ code):
{solution}


assistant: ### Phase 3: Implementing the Invariants as C++ Checkers

Let's create checker functions corresponding to the performance-characterizing invariants derived in Phase 2. These checkers will be inserted into the C++ program to detect and report potential slowdowns at runtime.

#### Invariant 1: High Count of Perfect Squares
```cpp
void check_high_perfect_square_count(int count, int n) {
    if (count > n / 2) {
        cerr << "Warning: High perfect square count causing imbalance!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

#### Invariant 2: Repeated Sorting and Summation
```cpp
void check_repeated_sorting_and_summing(int vectorSize, int threshold) {
    if (vectorSize > threshold) {
        cerr << "Warning: Repeated sorting and summing with large vector size!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

#### Invariant 3: Imbalance in Initial State
```cpp
void check_initial_imbalance(int c0, int c1, int n) {
    if (abs(c0 - c1) > n / 4) {
        cerr << "Warning: Initial imbalance in square and non-square piles!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrating Checkers into the Original Program

Now we will insert these checkers into the given C++ solution. We'll place the checkers at points in the code that effectively monitor conditions without adding overhead in tight loops.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int a[200000];

// Checker functions
void check_high_perfect_square_count(int count, int n) {
    if (count > n / 2) {
        cerr << "Warning: High perfect square count causing imbalance!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_repeated_sorting_and_summing(int vectorSize, int threshold) {
    if (vectorSize > threshold) {
        cerr << "Warning: Repeated sorting and summing with large vector size!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_initial_imbalance(int c0, int c1, int n) {
    if (abs(c0 - c1) > n / 4) {
        cerr << "Warning: Initial imbalance in square and non-square piles!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    int c[2];
    memset(c, 0, sizeof c);
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        cin >> a[i];
        c[(int)sqrt(a[i]) * (int)sqrt(a[i]) == a[i]]++;
    }

    // Check for initial imbalance
    check_initial_imbalance(c[0], c[1], n);

    if (c[0] == c[1]) {
        cout << 0 << endl;
        return 0;
    }

    long long val = 0;
    vector<int> v;
    v.clear();

    if (c[1] > c[0]) {
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (!((int)sqrt(a[i]) * (int)sqrt(a[i]) - a[i]))
                a[i] ? v.push_back(1) : v.push_back(2);
        }
        
        // Check for high perfect square count
        check_high_perfect_square_count(c[1], n);

        sort(v.begin(), v.end());
        
        // Check for repeated sorting and summing
        check_repeated_sorting_and_summing(v.size(), n / 4);

        for (int i = 0; i < c[1] - (n >> 1); i++) {
            val += v[i];
        }
        
        cout << val << endl;
        return 0;
    }

    val = 0;
    v.clear();
    if (c[0] > c[1]) {
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if ((int)sqrt(a[i]) * (int)sqrt(a[i]) - a[i]) {
                v.push_back(
                    min(abs((int)sqrt(a[i]) * (int)sqrt(a[i]) - a[i]),
                        abs(((int)sqrt(a[i]) + 1) * ((int)sqrt(a[i]) + 1) - a[i])));
            }
        }
        
        sort(v.begin(), v.end());

        // Check for repeated sorting and summing
        check_repeated_sorting_and_summing(v.size(), n / 4);

        for (int i = 0; i < c[0] - (n >> 1); i++) {
            val += v[i];
        }
        
        cout << val << endl;
        return 0;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation
- **High Perfect Square Count:** A check is inserted after the initial counting to ensure that the number of perfect squares does not exceed half the number of piles by a large margin.
- **Repeated Sorting and Summing:** Placed just before the sorting operation to ensure that it doesn't exceed a certain threshold that would cause slow execution.
- **Initial Imbalance:** This check is done right after counting the initial perfect squares and non-square numbers to catch any initial imbalances early on. 

These checks will help detect potential performance issues by triggering warnings during execution when the defined conditions are met.
