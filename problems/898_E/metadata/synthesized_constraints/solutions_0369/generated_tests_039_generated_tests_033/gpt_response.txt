**Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments**

1. **Comparison of Line-Level Hit Counts**:
   - Lines 35 to 36 show significantly high hit counts for the slow input. Specifically, the loop iterating over all possible square numbers from `0` to `31630` (total 31631 iterations) is executed. This loop does not appear in the fast input run.
   - Lines 38 to 44 also have notable hit counts for the slow input but none for the fast input. This suggests a computation over the `other` vector, which stores non-square numbers from the input.

2. **Pinpointing Lines/Functions with More Hits**:
   - Line 35 to 36: Generating all possible square numbers up to 31630. This precomputation is expensive and only occurs in the slow input path.
   - Line 39: Using `lower_bound` to find the closest square number for each non-square element in `other`.
   - Lines 40 to 42: Calculating the minimal distance between a non-square number and its nearest square number.

3. **Inferences**:
   - The appearance of the `sqrv` population loop and the subsequent processing of `other` indicate that the slow path is triggered when the initial count of square numbers (`sqr`) is less than `n/2`.
   - The `lower_bound` operation over a potentially large vector `sqrv` (of size 31631) can be computationally expensive, especially if many non-square numbers are processed.

**Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants**

1. **Natural Language Statements Describing Conditions for Slowdown**:

    - **Invariant #1**: "If the initial count of piles containing a square number is less than half of the total piles, the program enters a slow path where it precomputes all possible square numbers up to a large limit and processes each non-square pile."
  
    - **Invariant #2**: "When the number of non-square piles is significant, and each is compared against a precomputed list of possible square numbers, the execution time can increase substantially due to repeated binary searches."
  
    - **Invariant #3**: "If many piles are far from being a square of an integer, resulting in large adjustments, the computation of minimal moves involves costly distance calculations, contributing to the slowdown."

2. **Threshold Values**:
   - The threshold is abstractly when `sqr < n / 2`, causing the extensive processing of the `other` list.
   - The large iteration over the `sqrv` vector and subsequent processing indicates the potential for a large computational overhead when handling many non-square numbers.

3. **Abstract Conditions to Detect Future Slow Scenarios**:
   - These statements capture the essence of the problem's complexity and how input characteristics (such as the distribution of square and non-square piles) influence performance, without relying on fixed numeric thresholds from specific inputs.

By considering these invariants, a fuzzer can predict scenarios that may lead to slow performance by targeting inputs that skew the initial distribution of square and non-square piles, pushing the solution into its computationally expensive branch.

**Phase 3: Implementing Checkers for Natural Language Invariants**

Let's translate the natural language invariants derived earlier into C++ checker code:

1. **Invariant #1**: If the initial count of piles containing a square number is less than half of the total piles, the program enters a slow path.
   ```cpp
   void check_square_distribution(bool condition) {
       if (condition) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - insufficient square numbers initially!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Invariant #2**: When a significant number of non-square piles need to be processed against a precomputed list, the code path is expensive due to repeated binary searches.
   ```cpp
   void check_non_square_processing(bool condition) {
       if (condition) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - extensive non-square processing!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Invariant #3**: If many piles are far from being a square of an integer, resulting in large adjustments, the computation of minimal moves involves costly distance calculations.
   ```cpp
   void check_distance_calculations(bool condition) {
       if (condition) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - costly distance calculations needed!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

**Phase 4: Integrating Checkers into the Original Program**

Now we integrate these checkers at appropriate points in the original C++ code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
using ll = long long;
const int N = 200623;

bool is_sqr(ll x) {
    ll sq = sqrt(x);
    return (sq * sq == x);
}

// Checker Function for Invariant #1
void check_square_distribution(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - insufficient square numbers initially!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Checker Function for Invariant #2
void check_non_square_processing(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - extensive non-square processing!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Checker Function for Invariant #3
void check_distance_calculations(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - costly distance calculations needed!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);
    cout.tie(NULL);
    
    ll n;
    cin >> n;
    ll a[N], sqr = 0, zero = 0;
    vector<ll> sqrv, other, dis;

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        cin >> a[i];
        if (is_sqr(a[i])) {
            sqr++;
            if (!a[i]) zero++;
        } else
            other.push_back(a[i]);
    }

    // Place check for Invariant #1 after counting squares
    check_square_distribution(sqr < (n >> 1));

    if (sqr >= (n >> 1)) {
        ll non_zero_sqr = sqr - zero;
        ll val = sqr - (n >> 1);
        ll mn = min(non_zero_sqr, val);
        non_zero_sqr -= mn;
        val -= mn;
        cout << mn + (val << 1) << '\n';
        return 0;
    }
  
    for (int i = 0; i <= 31630; i++) {
        sqrv.push_back(i * i);
    }

    // Place check for Invariant #2 before processing non-square numbers
    check_non_square_processing(!other.empty());

    for (int i = 0; i < other.size(); i++) {
        ll lo = lower_bound(sqrv.begin(), sqrv.end(), other[i]) - sqrv.begin();
        ll mn = abs(sqrv[lo] - other[i]);
        if (lo) {
            mn = min(mn, abs(sqrv[lo - 1] - other[i]));
        }
        dis.push_back(mn);
    }

    sort(dis.begin(), dis.end());
    ll req = (n >> 1) - sqr;
    ll ans = 0;

    // Place check for Invariant #3 before calculating minimal moves
    check_distance_calculations(req > 0 && !dis.empty());

    for (int i = 0; i < req; i++) {
        ans += dis[i];
    }
    cout << ans << '\n';
}
```

**Integration Explanation:**

- **Invariant #1**: The check is placed right after the initial counting of squares, before deciding whether to enter the slow path.
- **Invariant #2**: It is placed before starting the expensive non-square processing loop.
- **Invariant #3**: This check is placed just before calculating minimal moves, which involves sorted distances. 

These checks provide early warnings for performance bottlenecks, assisting in identifying critical input patterns that cause slow execution.
