system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

Ann and Borya have n piles with candies and n is even number. There are ai candies in pile with number i.

Ann likes numbers which are square of some integer and Borya doesn't like numbers which are square of any integer. During one move guys can select some pile with candies and add one candy to it (this candy is new and doesn't belong to any other pile) or remove one candy (if there is at least one candy in this pile). 

Find out minimal number of moves that is required to make exactly n / 2 piles contain number of candies that is a square of some integer and exactly n / 2 piles contain number of candies that is not a square of any integer.

Input

First line contains one even integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 200 000) — number of piles with candies.

Second line contains sequence of integers a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 109) — amounts of candies in each pile.

Output

Output minimal number of steps required to make exactly n / 2 piles contain number of candies that is a square of some integer and exactly n / 2 piles contain number of candies that is not a square of any integer. If condition is already satisfied output 0.

Note

In first example you can satisfy condition in two moves. During each move you should add one candy to second pile. After it size of second pile becomes 16. After that Borya and Ann will have two piles with number of candies which is a square of integer (second and fourth pile) and two piles with number of candies which is not a square of any integer (first and third pile).

In second example you should add two candies to any three piles.

  long long i, j, n, count0 = 0, sq = 0, unsq = 0, arr[200000];

assistant: To diagnose why the provided C program runs slowly on the slow input compared to the fast input, we need to analyze the code and the associated hit count information. We will follow the phases outlined in your task instructions to identify expensive or inefficient code segments and then derive performance-characterizing invariants.

### Phase 1: Identifying Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Loop Analysis**: 
   - The loop at line 6 iterates over all elements in the array `arr` to classify them into `sq` (perfect squares) and `unsq` (non-perfect squares). It runs `n` times and involves a square root calculation and a conditional check.
   - The while loop starting at line 23 is hit 29 times for the slow input but not at all for the fast input, indicating significant computational effort there. This loop tries to balance `sq` and `unsq` by adjusting counts.

2. **Conditional and Branching**:
   - The condition `if (sq > unsq)` at line 19 is executed for the slow input. The logic inside involves loops where `sq` and `unsq` are adjusted by adding or removing candies, and if `sq` is zero, adjustments are made using `count0`.

3. **Data Calculations**: 
   - The logic from line 39 onwards is not executed for the slow input but rather for cases where `sq <= unsq`.

### Phase 2: Deriving Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the observed inefficiencies and the hit count information, we can derive the following performance-characterizing invariants:

1. **Invariant 1: Imbalance in Perfect and Non-Perfect Squares**:
   - **Natural Language Description**: "When there is a substantial imbalance between the number of piles with perfect squares and non-perfect squares of candies, the program might require numerous adjustments, leading to increased computation time."
   - **Explanation**: The code spends time rebalancing `sq` and `unsq`, and significant computational effort occurs when `sq > unsq`, necessitating many operations to change pile counts.

2. **Invariant 2: Large Number of Zero Piles**:
   - **Natural Language Description**: "If there are many piles with zero candies, and perfect squares need to be increased, the program may slow down because it has to make more adjustments to achieve the desired balance."
   - **Explanation**: The slow input has many zero piles, leading to more operations when adjusting `sq` and `unsq` counts, as zero piles initially don't contribute to `sq`.

3. **Invariant 3: Need for Multiple Adjustments**:
   - **Natural Language Description**: "If the initial distribution of candies leads to a significant count difference between `sq` and `unsq`, especially when `sq` > `unsq`, the program will enter a slow adjustment loop."
   - **Explanation**: When the initial conditions require changing many piles to achieve the desired balance, the program undertakes numerous iterations and calculations.

### Considerations
- The performance bottlenecks stem primarily from the need to rebalance via many small operations, particularly when `sq` needs to be reduced or when zero piles need adjustment to become non-square.
- These issues highlight a relationship between the initial configuration of the piles and the number of operations needed to reach the balanced state, particularly when the input size and structure lead to many zero piles or a marked imbalance in square/non-square distributions.

By formulating these invariants, we can better understand and predict slow performance scenarios without relying solely on specific input values, thus aiding in the detection of similar issues with other potential inputs.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
Ann and Borya have n piles with candies and n is even number. There are ai candies in pile with number i.

Ann likes numbers which are square of some integer and Borya doesn't like numbers which are square of any integer. During one move guys can select some pile with candies and add one candy to it (this candy is new and doesn't belong to any other pile) or remove one candy (if there is at least one candy in this pile). 

Find out minimal number of moves that is required to make exactly n / 2 piles contain number of candies that is a square of some integer and exactly n / 2 piles contain number of candies that is not a square of any integer.

Input

First line contains one even integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 200 000) — number of piles with candies.

Second line contains sequence of integers a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 109) — amounts of candies in each pile.

Output

Output minimal number of steps required to make exactly n / 2 piles contain number of candies that is a square of some integer and exactly n / 2 piles contain number of candies that is not a square of any integer. If condition is already satisfied output 0.

Note

In first example you can satisfy condition in two moves. During each move you should add one candy to second pile. After it size of second pile becomes 16. After that Borya and Ann will have two piles with number of candies which is a square of integer (second and fourth pile) and two piles with number of candies which is not a square of any integer (first and third pile).

In second example you should add two candies to any three piles.

Solution (C++ code):

assistant: Let's implement the performance checks based on the invariants derived in Phase 2.

### Phase 3: Implementing Performance-Characterizing Invariants in C++

1. **Invariant 1: Imbalance in Perfect and Non-Perfect Squares**
   - **Checker Code**:
   ```cpp
   void check_imbalance_invariant(long long sq, long long unsq, long long n) {
       if (std::abs(sq - unsq) > n / 4) {  // arbitrary threshold for significant imbalance
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to imbalance in sq and unsq!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Invariant 2: Large Number of Zero Piles**
   - **Checker Code**:
   ```cpp
   void check_zero_piles_invariant(long long count0, long long n) {
       if (count0 > n / 4) {  // arbitrary threshold for many zero piles
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to many zero piles!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Invariant 3: Need for Multiple Adjustments**
   - **Checker Code**:
   ```cpp
   void check_adjustment_invariant(long long sq, long long unsq, long long n) {
       if (sq > n / 2 && unsq > 0) {  // condition where many adjustments are needed
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to excessive adjustments!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Integrating Checks into the Original Program

Now, we'll integrate the above checker code snippets into the original C++ program. We place these checks at strategic points to avoid overhead in tight loops.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Invariant Checkers
void check_imbalance_invariant(long long sq, long long unsq, long long n) {
    if (std::abs(sq - unsq) > n / 4) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to imbalance in sq and unsq!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_zero_piles_invariant(long long count0, long long n) {
    if (count0 > n / 4) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to many zero piles!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_adjustment_invariant(long long sq, long long unsq, long long n) {
    if (sq > n / 2 && unsq > 0) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to excessive adjustments!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    long long i, j, n, count0 = 0, sq = 0, unsq = 0, arr[200000];
    cin >> n;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i += 1) {
        cin >> arr[i];
        if (arr[i] == 0) count0++;
        if (sqrt(arr[i]) == (int)(sqrt(arr[i])))
            sq++;
        else
            unsq++;
    }

    // Check for imbalance
    check_imbalance_invariant(sq, unsq, n);

    // Check for many zero piles
    check_zero_piles_invariant(count0, n);

    if (sq == unsq) {
        cout << "0";
        return 0;
    }
    if (sq > unsq) {
        sq -= count0;
        long long a = 1;
        long long count = 0;
        while (unsq < n / 2) {
            if (sq == 0) {
                sq = count0;
                a = 2;
                continue;
            }
            sq--;
            unsq++;
            count += a;
        }
        cout << count;
        return 0;
    }

    long long temp[200000];
    long long v1, v2;
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        v1 = (int)(ceil(sqrt(arr[i])));
        v1 *= v1;
        v1 -= arr[i];
        v2 = (int)(sqrt(arr[i]));
        v2 *= v2;
        v2 -= arr[i];
        v2 *= -1;
        temp[i] = min(v1, v2);
    }
    sort(temp, temp + n);
    long long count = 0;
    i = 0;
    while (sq < n / 2) {
        if (temp[i] != 0) {
            count += temp[i];
            sq++;
        }
        i++;
    }
    cout << count;
    return 0;
}
```

### Comments and Considerations:
- **Imbalance Check**: Placed just before any adjustments are made to `sq` and `unsq` ensuring an early warning if there's a significant imbalance.
- **Zero Piles Check**: Executed immediately after input processing, detecting if `count0` exceeds a threshold.
- **Adjustment Check**: Placed in the logic branch where adjustments occur, ensuring that excessive adjustment operations can be flagged.
- These checks help in identifying potential bottlenecks and allow a fuzzer to detect conditions leading to slow performance.
