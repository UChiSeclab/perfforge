system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

Polycarp takes part in a math show. He is given n tasks, each consists of k subtasks, numbered 1 through k. It takes him tj minutes to solve the j-th subtask of any task. Thus, time required to solve a subtask depends only on its index, but not on the task itself. Polycarp can solve subtasks in any order.

By solving subtask of arbitrary problem he earns one point. Thus, the number of points for task is equal to the number of solved subtasks in it. Moreover, if Polycarp completely solves the task (solves all k of its subtasks), he recieves one extra point. Thus, total number of points he recieves for the complete solution of the task is k + 1.

Polycarp has M minutes of time. What is the maximum number of points he can earn?

Input

The first line contains three integer numbers n, k and M (1 ≤ n ≤ 45, 1 ≤ k ≤ 45, 0 ≤ M ≤ 2·109).

The second line contains k integer numbers, values tj (1 ≤ tj ≤ 1000000), where tj is the time in minutes required to solve j-th subtask of any task.

Output

Print the maximum amount of points Polycarp can earn in M minutes.

Note

In the first example Polycarp can complete the first task and spend 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10 minutes. He also has the time to solve one subtask of the second task in one minute.

In the second example Polycarp can solve the first subtask of all five tasks and spend 5·1 = 5 minutes. Also he can solve the second subtasks of two tasks and spend 2·2 = 4 minutes. Thus, he earns 5 + 2 = 7 points in total.

assistant: Based on the provided C++ code and the hit count information for the slow and fast inputs, the following analysis and performance-characterizing invariants can be derived:

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **High Hit Counts in Nested Loops:** 
   - In the slow input scenario, lines within the nested loops (lines 20-25) show significantly higher hit counts compared to the fast input. Specifically:
     - Line 20 (outermost loop over `j`) is executed 7232 times in the slow run versus 5 times in the fast run.
     - Line 22 (loop over `l`) is executed 23863 times in the slow run versus 3 times in the fast run.
     - Line 23 (conditional check) and line 25 (updating `next_dp`) are executed over 20,000 times in the slow run but only 2 times in the fast run.

2. **Data Structure Interactions:**
   - The `dp` and `next_dp` vectors are being filled and used extensively. The `std::fill` and `std::swap` operations (lines 18, 19, and 31) are executed frequently, suggesting these vectors are large and repeatedly manipulated.

3. **Constraints and Input Impact:**
   - Since `n` and `k` determine the dimensions of the computation, high values for `n` and `k` (both close to their maximum of 45) result in a much larger search space and increased number of iterations in loops, leading to higher execution counts and slower performance.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **Invariant on Task and Subtask Count:**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "When both the number of tasks `n` and the number of subtasks `k` are large, specifically when their product approaches the upper constraint, the nested loop iterations increase significantly, causing performance degradation."
   - **Explanation:** The complexity of the algorithm is highly dependent on the product of `n` and `k`, impacting the dimensions of `dp` and causing numerous updates and checks.

2. **Invariant on Time Constraints and Subtask Time:**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "If the sum of the subtasks' required time approaches the total available time `M`, especially with larger values of `k`, the algorithm tends to explore many combinations extensively, leading to slower execution."
   - **Explanation:** The algorithm tries different combinations of subtasks within the given time limit, and when the time required is close to available time, it increases the iterations over possible solutions.

3. **Invariant on Vector Size and Update Frequency:**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "When the potential maximum points (`n * (k + 1)`) is large, the size of `dp` and `next_dp` vectors becomes a concern. Frequent updates and fills of these large vectors slow down computation."
   - **Explanation:** The repetition of vector operations (`fill`, `min`, `swap`) becomes costly as the vector size grows due to large `n` and `k`.

### Summary

The slowdown in the provided code is triggered by large values of `n` and `k`, which increase the complexity and the number of iterations of nested loops. Additionally, the manipulation of large vectors (`dp`, `next_dp`) further exacerbates the performance bottleneck. By keeping these invariants in mind, future inputs can be evaluated for potential slowdowns without explicitly relying on specific input values.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
Polycarp takes part in a math show. He is given n tasks, each consists of k subtasks, numbered 1 through k. It takes him tj minutes to solve the j-th subtask of any task. Thus, time required to solve a subtask depends only on its index, but not on the task itself. Polycarp can solve subtasks in any order.

By solving subtask of arbitrary problem he earns one point. Thus, the number of points for task is equal to the number of solved subtasks in it. Moreover, if Polycarp completely solves the task (solves all k of its subtasks), he recieves one extra point. Thus, total number of points he recieves for the complete solution of the task is k + 1.

Polycarp has M minutes of time. What is the maximum number of points he can earn?

Input

The first line contains three integer numbers n, k and M (1 ≤ n ≤ 45, 1 ≤ k ≤ 45, 0 ≤ M ≤ 2·109).

The second line contains k integer numbers, values tj (1 ≤ tj ≤ 1000000), where tj is the time in minutes required to solve j-th subtask of any task.

Output

Print the maximum amount of points Polycarp can earn in M minutes.

Examples

Input

3 4 11
1 2 3 4


Output

6


Input

5 5 10
1 2 4 8 16


Output

7

Note

In the first example Polycarp can complete the first task and spend 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10 minutes. He also has the time to solve one subtask of the second task in one minute.

In the second example Polycarp can solve the first subtask of all five tasks and spend 5·1 = 5 minutes. Also he can solve the second subtasks of two tasks and spend 2·2 = 4 minutes. Thus, he earns 5 + 2 = 7 points in total.

Solution (C++ code):

assistant: ### Phase 3: Implementing Invariants in C++

Here, we translate the natural language invariants identified in Phase 2 into C++ code for runtime checks.

1. **Invariant on Task and Subtask Count:**

```cpp
void check_task_subtask_invariant(long long n, long long k) {
    if (n * k > 1500) {  // Assumes a product threshold for complexity
        cerr << "Warning: task_subtask_invariant triggered - high task and subtask count!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

2. **Invariant on Time Constraints and Subtask Time:**

```cpp
void check_time_constraint_invariant(long long sum_t, long long M, long long k) {
    if (sum_t > M * 0.9 && k > 30) {  // Using a threshold of 90% of M and a high k
        cerr << "Warning: time_constraint_invariant triggered - subtasks time approaching limit!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

3. **Invariant on Vector Size and Update Frequency:**

```cpp
void check_vector_update_invariant(long long max_points) {
    if (max_points > 2000) {  // Arbitrary threshold for vector size
        cerr << "Warning: vector_update_invariant triggered - large vector updates expected!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrating Checks into the Original Program

The next step is to integrate these checks into the original C++ code at appropriate execution points to avoid unnecessary overhead.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
 public:
  void solve(std::istream& in, std::ostream& out) {
    long long n, k, m;
    in >> n >> k >> m;
    
    // Check invariant on task and subtask count
    check_task_subtask_invariant(n, k);

    std::vector<long long> t(k);
    for (long long i = 0; i < k; ++i) in >> t[i];

    // Calculate sum of subtasks' time
    long long sum_t = std::accumulate(t.begin(), t.end(), 0LL);

    // Check invariant on time constraints
    check_time_constraint_invariant(sum_t, m, k);

    long long max_points = n * (k + 1);

    // Check invariant on vector size and update frequency
    check_vector_update_invariant(max_points);

    std::vector<long long> dp(max_points + 1, std::numeric_limits<long long>::max());
    auto next_dp = dp;
    std::sort(t.begin(), t.end());
    std::partial_sum(t.begin(), t.end(), t.begin());
    dp[0] = 0;
    
    for (long long i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
      std::fill(next_dp.begin(), next_dp.end(), std::numeric_limits<long long>::max());
      for (long long j = 0; j <= max_points; ++j) {
        if (dp[j] < std::numeric_limits<long long>::max()) {
          for (long long l = 0; l < k; ++l) {
            if (dp[j] + t[l] <= m) {
              auto points = j + ((l == k - 1) ? (k + 1) : (l + 1));
              next_dp[points] = std::min(next_dp[points], dp[j] + t[l]);
            }
          }
          next_dp[j] = std::min(dp[j], next_dp[j]);
        }
      }
      std::swap(dp, next_dp);
    }
    
    out << prev(std::find_if(dp.rbegin(), dp.rend(), [](long long x) {
                               return x < std::numeric_limits<long long>::max();
                             }).base()) - dp.begin()
        << '\n';
  }
};

void solve(std::istream& in, std::ostream& out) {
  out << std::setprecision(12);
  Solution solution;
  solution.solve(in, out);
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(0);
  istream& in = cin;
  ostream& out = cout;
  solve(in, out);
  return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of Code Integration

- **Task and Subtask Count Check:** Placed after reading `n` and `k` since it checks their product.
- **Time Constraint Check:** Added after reading `t` and calculating the sum of times. It ensures this sum doesn't approach `M` too closely when `k` is high.
- **Vector Size and Update Frequency Check:** Positioned right after calculating `max_points`, which determines the size of `dp` and `next_dp`.

By implementing these checks, we provide early warnings if the program is likely to hit performance bottlenecks based on the identified invariants. These checks help in debugging and optimizing future inputs that might cause slowdowns.
