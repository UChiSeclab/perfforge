=== Invariants Response ===
To address the task, let me systematically analyze the C program and derive performance-characterizing invariants:

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Line-Level Analysis**:
   - The lines within the loop starting at line 45 (`while (n > 0)`) are hit significantly more during the slow input compared to the fast input:
     - Lines 45, 46, 47, and 48 are hit very frequently with the slow input.
   - The loop on line 42 (`for (int i = 0; i < 1000000; i++)`) completes a fixed number of iterations (1,000,000) regardless of input size, so it doesn't contribute to a differential slowdown.

2. **Interpreting the Hits**:
   - The `while` loop on line 45 iterates based on the value of `n` after the transformations and calculations preceding it. The computation inside involves multiplying and reducing `n` iteratively. 
   - For the slow input, `n` is significantly larger after its initial setup. Therefore, it causes the loop to execute many more times than for the fast input.

3. **Interaction with Data**:
   - The multiplication and modulo operations on lines 38-40 transform input `n` and `m` into smaller equivalents, potentially leading to a large value of `n` in the `while` loop.
   - The condition `if (n > 1000000)` on line 46 is true for many iterations in the slow input, hence the block with `n -= 1000000` executes repeatedly, contributing to the slowdown.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the above analysis, here are natural language statements that characterize the performance issues:

1. **Large Effective Size of `n`**:
   - **Invariant**: "When the effective value of `n` after modulo operations is significantly large, the program enters a long loop of computation, slowing down execution."
   - **Explanation**: The effective size of `n` dictates how many times the loop executes. A large `n` results in many iterations, especially when reduced by a constant like 1,000,000 each time.

2. **Conditional Path Execution**:
   - **Invariant**: "If the condition `n > 1000000` is frequently true within the loop, this indicates repeated execution of heavy computations, leading to slow performance."
   - **Explanation**: The loop has two branches, one for `n > 1000000` and another for smaller values. Frequent satisfaction of the larger condition results in a slower path.

3. **Input-Driven Behavior**:
   - **Invariant**: "Larger input values for `n` and `m` combined with the condition `(n * m) % (1000000007 - 1)` result in operations that scale poorly, especially near boundary conditions."
   - **Explanation**: The calculations effectively scale down large values, but still manage to produce a significant number of iterations for the loop.

These invariants abstractly describe why the program slows down for specific inputs without relying on exact values. They reflect the impact of input transformations and branching conditions on execution time.

### Phase 3: Implementing Checker Code for Performance Invariants

Based on the performance-characterizing invariants I previously outlined, here are the C++ checker functions:

1. **Checker for Large Effective Size of `n`**:

```cpp
void check_large_n_invariant(long long n) {
    if (n > 1000000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large effective value of n." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

2. **Checker for Frequent Large Condition Execution**:

```cpp
void check_frequent_large_condition(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - frequent large condition execution in loop." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrate Checker Code into the Original Program

The following is the instrumented C++ code with the checker functions integrated:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

void check_large_n_invariant(long long n) {
    if (n > 1000000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large effective value of n." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_frequent_large_condition(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - frequent large condition execution in loop." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    long long n, m, k, ans = 1;
    cin >> n >> m >> k;
    if (k == -1) {
        if ((n + m) % 2 == 1) {
            cout << 0;
            return 0;
        }
    }
    n--;
    m--;
    n = n % (1000000007 - 1);
    m = m % (1000000007 - 1);
    n = (n * m) % (1000000007 - 1);

    // Check for large effective value of n
    check_large_n_invariant(n);

    long long i2_in_10_6 = 1;
    for (int i = 0; i < 1000000; i++) {
        i2_in_10_6 = (i2_in_10_6 * 2) % 1000000007;
    }
    
    while (n > 0) {
        // Check for frequent large condition execution
        check_frequent_large_condition(n > 1000000);

        if (n > 1000000) {
            ans = (ans * i2_in_10_6) % 1000000007;
            n -= 1000000;
        } else {
            ans = (ans * 2) % 1000000007;
            n--;
        }
    }
    cout << ans;
}
```

### Explanation of Checker Placement

- **`check_large_n_invariant`:** This is placed immediately after `n` is transformed and reduced since it checks whether `n` has a large effective value that could lead to a slowdown.
- **`check_frequent_large_condition`:** This is placed inside the `while` loop to trigger if the condition `n > 1000000` is repeatedly and frequently true, indicating a possible slow path in execution. 

These checks help detect when the program might experience performance bottlenecks due to large values or frequent execution paths that are computationally expensive.
