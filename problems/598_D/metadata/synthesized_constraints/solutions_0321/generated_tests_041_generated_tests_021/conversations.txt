system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

Igor is in the museum and he wants to see as many pictures as possible.

Museum can be represented as a rectangular field of n × m cells. Each cell is either empty or impassable. Empty cells are marked with '.', impassable cells are marked with '*'. Every two adjacent cells of different types (one empty and one impassable) are divided by a wall containing one picture.

At the beginning Igor is in some empty cell. At every moment he can move to any empty cell that share a side with the current one.

For several starting positions you should calculate the maximum number of pictures that Igor can see. Igor is able to see the picture only if he is in the cell adjacent to the wall with this picture. Igor have a lot of time, so he will examine every picture he can see.

Input

First line of the input contains three integers n, m and k (3 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ k ≤ min(n·m, 100 000)) — the museum dimensions and the number of starting positions to process.

Each of the next n lines contains m symbols '.', '*' — the description of the museum. It is guaranteed that all border cells are impassable, so Igor can't go out from the museum.

Each of the last k lines contains two integers x and y (1 ≤ x ≤ n, 1 ≤ y ≤ m) — the row and the column of one of Igor's starting positions respectively. Rows are numbered from top to bottom, columns — from left to right. It is guaranteed that all starting positions are empty cells.

Output

Print k integers — the maximum number of pictures, that Igor can see if he starts in corresponding position.

assistant: To analyze the performance bottlenecks in the provided C code, we will execute two phases:

### Phase 1: Identify expensive or inefficient code segments

1. **Compare line-level hit counts:**
   - The `helper` function (lines 19-48) and `find` function (lines 4-18) both show increased hit counts when processing the slow input compared to the fast input. Specifically, recursive calls in `helper` and `find` have considerably higher hit counts in the slow input.
   - The line `helper(a, i, j, n, m, b)` (line 75) and `find(b, i, j, n, m, dp[i][j], d)` (line 76) are hit significantly more in the slow input, which indicates these functions are being triggered more often or recursing deeper.

2. **Pinpoint lines or functions:**
   - The recursion in `helper` (lines 27, 33, 39, 45) and `find` (lines 9, 12, 14, 17) is likely the main cause of inefficiency due to the high number of hits and the nested nature of these calls.
   - The conditions leading to recursive calls are more frequently met in the slow input, hinting at more complex or extensive search spaces being explored.

3. **Infer interactions with data structures:**
   - The recursion depth and the number of branching conditions in `helper` and `find` are likely influenced by the configuration of the museum's layout (`a` vector).

### Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants

1. **Generate natural language statements:**
   - **Invariant 1: Complex Path Exploration**
     - “The program slows down when Igor starts from a position where a large contiguous area of empty cells needs to be explored, causing deep recursive calls.”
   - **Invariant 2: High Branching Factor**
     - “If the museum layout has multiple connected paths from a starting position, the recursion may branch excessively, increasing the number of operations.”
   - **Invariant 3: Large Search Space**
     - “Performance degradation occurs when a starting position is adjacent to a significant number of impassable cells, increasing the number of pictures that need to be counted.”

2. **Correlate these conditions:**
   - These conditions are triggered by certain input patterns, such as:
     - Large areas of connected empty cells (`.`) that increase recursion depth.
     - Multiple paths or directions to explore from a given starting cell.
     - High local density of walls (`*`) next to starting positions, leading to more picture counting.

3. **Broad but realistic triggers:**
   - Given the constraint `n, m <= 1000`, these performance bottlenecks are realistic in scenarios where the search space is extensive due to complex layouts or large connected components of empty cells.

### Considerations and Suggestions

- Avoiding high recursion depths and branching can be achieved by optimizing the recursive strategy or using iterative methods.
- Prioritize detecting large empty sections and reducing unnecessary recursive calls by pre-computing connectivity or using dynamic programming techniques to minimize recomputation.

By focusing on these traits, we can devise strategies to enhance performance when similar conditions arise in future inputs.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
Igor is in the museum and he wants to see as many pictures as possible.

Museum can be represented as a rectangular field of n × m cells. Each cell is either empty or impassable. Empty cells are marked with '.', impassable cells are marked with '*'. Every two adjacent cells of different types (one empty and one impassable) are divided by a wall containing one picture.

At the beginning Igor is in some empty cell. At every moment he can move to any empty cell that share a side with the current one.

For several starting positions you should calculate the maximum number of pictures that Igor can see. Igor is able to see the picture only if he is in the cell adjacent to the wall with this picture. Igor have a lot of time, so he will examine every picture he can see.

Input

First line of the input contains three integers n, m and k (3 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ k ≤ min(n·m, 100 000)) — the museum dimensions and the number of starting positions to process.

Each of the next n lines contains m symbols '.', '*' — the description of the museum. It is guaranteed that all border cells are impassable, so Igor can't go out from the museum.

Each of the last k lines contains two integers x and y (1 ≤ x ≤ n, 1 ≤ y ≤ m) — the row and the column of one of Igor's starting positions respectively. Rows are numbered from top to bottom, columns — from left to right. It is guaranteed that all starting positions are empty cells.

Output

Print k integers — the maximum number of pictures, that Igor can see if he starts in corresponding position.

assistant: ### Phase 3: Implementing Invariants as Checker Code in C++

Below is the C++ checker code for the previously derived natural language invariants:

1. **Invariant 1: Complex Path Exploration**

   ```cpp
   void check_complex_path_invariant(bool condition) {
       if (condition) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - complex path exploration!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Invariant 2: High Branching Factor**

   ```cpp
   void check_branching_invariant(bool condition) {
       if (condition) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high branching factor!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Invariant 3: Large Search Space**

   ```cpp
   void check_search_space_invariant(bool condition) {
       if (condition) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large search space!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Integrating Checker Code with the Original Program

Here is the instrumented C++ program with the checker functions integrated at appropriate points:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int dp[1000][1000];

void check_complex_path_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {

    }
}

void check_branching_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high branching factor!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_search_space_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {

}
```

### Explanation

- **Complex Path Exploration**: Checked at the start based on `n * m` to anticipate expensive computations due to a large grid size.
- **High Branching Factor**: Checked after computing `dp[i][j]` in `helper` to detect when a high number of branches might slow down execution.
- **Large Search Space**: Checked in `helper` to detect when a cell surrounded by multiple empty cells might lead to excessive recursion.

These checks will abort the program and provide warnings if potential performance bottlenecks are detected during execution.
