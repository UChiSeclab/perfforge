=== Invariants Response ===
To diagnose the performance bottleneck in the provided C program, let's first analyze the line-level hit counts, focusing on the lines with significantly different hit counts in the slow and fast runs. Then, I'll derive performance-characterizing invariants.

### Phase 1: Identifying Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

#### Analysis of Line-Level Hit Counts:

1. **`forward` Function**:
   - Lines 6-12 in the `forward` function have a significantly higher hit count in the slow input compared to the fast input. This suggests that the recursive calls to `forward` are a major factor in the slowdown.
   - The recursive calls on lines 10-11 are particularly noteworthy, as they indicate repeated traversal of the field, likely leading to deep recursion or excessive computation.

2. **`back` Function**:
   - Lines 14-21 also show higher hits for the slow input, particularly the recursive calls on lines 18-21.
   - Similar to `forward`, this indicates potential inefficiency due to repeated operations on the same data structure.

3. **`calc_cell_points` Function**:
   - This function has a higher invocation count in the slow input, linked to repeatedly calculating points for starting positions.
   - The combination of `forward` and `back` functions suggests that overlapping computations are being redundantly performed multiple times.

### Phase 2: Deriving Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the analysis, the following natural language performance invariants can be proposed:

1. **Excessive Recursion Invariant**:
   - **Description**: "If a starting position leads to a recursive exploration of empty cells that cover a large part of the museum, the program may slow down significantly. This is exacerbated if many starting positions fall within the same large connected area of empty cells."
   - **Trigger**: This invariant is triggered when the recursive exploration of connected empty cells (`'.'`) results in a deep or broad recursion, particularly affecting performance when the recursion repeatedly explores large connected components for multiple starting positions.

2. **Redundant Calculation Invariant**:
   - **Description**: "If multiple starting positions are within the same connected region of empty cells, redundant calculations may occur, leading to performance degradation. Optimizing to avoid recalculating the same connected region's picture count can improve performance."
   - **Trigger**: When starting positions are located within the same connected component of empty cells, the `calc_cell_points` function recalculates the same area multiple times.

3. **Large Connected Component Invariant**:
   - **Description**: "If the museum contains a very large connected component of empty cells, the recursive operations for measuring pictures can become expensive. The likelihood of slowdown increases when recursive functions explore large empty areas."
   - **Trigger**: This is triggered by the size and complexity of connected empty areas, especially when these require extensive recursion to determine the number of visible pictures.

### Recommendations:

- **Memoization**: Implement memoization for `calc_cell_points` to store results for connected components once calculated, avoiding repeated computation for the same region.
- **Avoid Redundancy**: Track which areas have been fully explored and avoid recalculating them for subsequent starting positions.
- **Limit Recursion**: Consider iterative approaches to reduce the overhead associated with deep recursion, which can be particularly problematic in large connected regions.

These invariants and recommendations aim to abstractly characterize and mitigate the performance issues observed in the slow input case, without relying on specific numeric values from the inputs.

=== Checker Response ===
### Phase 3: Implementing Performance-Characterizing Invariants as Checkers in C++

Here are the C++ checker functions based on the previously derived performance-characterizing invariants:

1. **Excessive Recursion Invariant**: Checks if the recursion depth becomes too high or if large connected components are repeatedly explored.
2. **Redundant Calculation Invariant**: Ensures that areas already calculated aren't recalculated unnecessarily.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

// Checker for excessive recursion or large connected components
void check_excessive_recursion(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive recursion or large connected component!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Checker for redundant calculation
void check_redundant_calculation(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - redundant calculation of the same area!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrating Checkers into the Original C++ Program

Here is the modified C++ code with the integrated runtime checks:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

vector<vector<char>> field;
vector<vector<int>> points;

// Checkers for performance bottlenecks
void check_excessive_recursion(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive recursion or large connected component!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_redundant_calculation(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - redundant calculation of the same area!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int is_wall(int i, int j) { return field[i][j] == '*' ? 1 : 0; }

int forward(int i, int j) {
    if (field[i][j] == '*') return 1;
    if (points[i][j] == -1) return 0;
    points[i][j] = -1;
    int pts = forward(i - 1, j) + forward(i + 1, j) +
              forward(i, j - 1) + forward(i, j + 1);

    // Check for excessive recursion using arbitrary threshold
    int max_recursion_depth = 3000; // Example threshold based on expected field size
    check_excessive_recursion(pts > max_recursion_depth);

    return pts;
}

void back(int i, int j, int pts) {
    if (field[i][j] == '*') return;
    if (points[i][j] > 0) return;
    points[i][j] = pts;
    back(i - 1, j, pts);
    back(i + 1, j, pts);
    back(i, j - 1, pts);
    back(i, j + 1, pts);
}

int calc_cell_points(int i, int j) {
    if (points[i][j] > 0) {
        return points[i][j];
    }

    // Check for redundant calculations
    int recalculation_threshold = 100; // Example threshold for repeated calculations
    check_redundant_calculation(points[i][j] == -1 && recalculation_threshold > 0);

    int pts = forward(i, j);
    back(i, j, pts);
    return pts;
}

int main() {
    int n, m, k;
    cin >> n >> m >> k;
    field = vector<vector<char>>(n, vector<char>(m));
    points = vector<vector<int>>(n, vector<int>(m));
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
            cin >> field[i][j];
        }
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
        int x, y;
        cin >> x >> y;
        cout << calc_cell_points(x - 1, y - 1) << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:

- **Excessive Recursion Check**: Integrated within the `forward` function, this check aborts if the recursive exploration depth exceeds a reasonable threshold, indicating a large connected component.
- **Redundant Calculation Check**: Placed in `calc_cell_points` to catch unnecessary recalculations for the same connected area.
- **Thresholds**: The thresholds (`max_recursion_depth` and `recalculation_threshold`) are chosen based on typical problem constraints (like maximum `n` and `m`) and can be tuned based on performance analysis.
  
This modified code will help identify performance bottlenecks during execution and assist in optimization efforts.
