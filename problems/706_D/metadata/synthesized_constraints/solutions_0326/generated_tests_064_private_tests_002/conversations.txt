system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

Author has gone out of the stories about Vasiliy, so here is just a formal task description.

You are given q queries and a multiset A, initially containing only integer 0. There are three types of queries:

  1. "+ x" — add integer x to multiset A.
  2. "- x" — erase one occurrence of integer x from multiset A. It's guaranteed that at least one x is present in the multiset A before this query.
  3. "? x" — you are given integer x and need to compute the value <image>, i.e. the maximum value of bitwise exclusive OR (also know as XOR) of integer x and some integer y from the multiset A.



Multiset is a set, where equal elements are allowed.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer q (1 ≤ q ≤ 200 000) — the number of queries Vasiliy has to perform.

Each of the following q lines of the input contains one of three characters '+', '-' or '?' and an integer xi (1 ≤ xi ≤ 109). It's guaranteed that there is at least one query of the third type.

Note, that the integer 0 will always be present in the set A.

Output

For each query of the type '?' print one integer — the maximum value of bitwise exclusive OR (XOR) of integer xi and some integer from the multiset A.

Example

Input

10
+ 8
+ 9
+ 11
+ 6
+ 1
? 3
- 8
? 3
? 8
? 11


Output

11
10
14
13

Note

After first five operations multiset A contains integers 0, 8, 9, 11, 6 and 1.

The answer for the sixth query is integer <image> — maximum among integers <image>, <image>, <image>, <image> and <image>.

assistant: ### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Hit Count Comparison:**
   - The `insert` and `deleteit` functions are heavily utilized in the slow input compared to the fast input due to repeated addition and removal of the same element, leading to a higher number of operations. Specifically, lines within these functions, such as the loop inside `insert` (line 18) and the checks and node creation in `getnode` (lines 20-30), have significantly higher hit counts.
   - The `deleteit` function (lines 35-54) also shows a higher number of hits, indicating frequent removal operations.
   - The function `find` (lines 55-78) is frequently called, especially within its loop (lines 59-77), indicating a high number of XOR operations being computed.

2. **Data Structure Interaction:**
   - The trie data structure used to store binary representations of numbers is repeatedly traversed and modified. Operations such as insertion and deletion in the trie become expensive due to frequent node creation and deletion.
   - Each modification to the trie potentially impacts all nodes down to a depth of 31 (since we represent numbers up to 31 bits), making these operations costly when performed repeatedly.

3. **Loop and Recursion Analysis:**
   - The nested loops within `insert` and `deleteit` cause them to traverse the trie tree, potentially up to 31 levels deep, for every insert or delete operation. This depth of traversal, combined with repeated operations on the same elements (such as adding or removing '4'), leads to performance inefficiencies.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **Repeated Element Operations:**
   - **Invariant 1:** "If the same element is repeatedly inserted and deleted, resulting in numerous modifications to the trie structure, the program may slow down. This is because each operation requires traversal and potential modification of nodes up to the maximum trie depth."
   
2. **Trie Depth and Node Management:**
   - **Invariant 2:** "If the operations on the trie reach deep levels frequently, especially when adding or removing elements, the program might experience slowdowns. This can become particularly impactful when the sequence involves many `+` and `-` operations, causing excessive node management at each bit level."

3. **Dense Query Operations:**
   - **Invariant 3:** "If a high number of `?` queries are executed consecutively after numerous changes to the trie, the XOR calculation operations may become expensive, especially if the trie structure has been deeply and widely modified by preceding operations."

4. **Structure and Pattern of Queries:**
   - **Invariant 4:** "Slow performance may occur when there is a dense sequence of `?` operations interleaved with `+` and `-` operations that frequently and deeply modify the trie, as the program must re-evaluate potential maximum XOR values repeatedly across a volatile structure."

By understanding these invariants, we can identify and avoid input patterns that lead to performance bottlenecks in the current implementation of the code. The primary focus should be on minimizing repeated operations on the same elements and managing the depth of operations within the trie data structure.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
Author has gone out of the stories about Vasiliy, so here is just a formal task description.

You are given q queries and a multiset A, initially containing only integer 0. There are three types of queries:

  1. "+ x" — add integer x to multiset A.
  2. "- x" — erase one occurrence of integer x from multiset A. It's guaranteed that at least one x is present in the multiset A before this query.
  3. "? x" — you are given integer x and need to compute the value <image>, i.e. the maximum value of bitwise exclusive OR (also know as XOR) of integer x and some integer y from the multiset A.



Multiset is a set, where equal elements are allowed.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer q (1 ≤ q ≤ 200 000) — the number of queries Vasiliy has to perform.

Each of the following q lines of the input contains one of three characters '+', '-' or '?' and an integer xi (1 ≤ xi ≤ 109). It's guaranteed that there is at least one query of the third type.

Note, that the integer 0 will always be present in the set A.

Output

For each query of the type '?' print one integer — the maximum value of bitwise exclusive OR (XOR) of integer xi and some integer from the multiset A.

Example

Input

10
+ 8
+ 9
+ 11
+ 6
+ 1
? 3
- 8
? 3
? 8
? 11


Output

11
10
14
13

Note

After first five operations multiset A contains integers 0, 8, 9, 11, 6 and 1.

The answer for the sixth query is integer <image> — maximum among integers <image>, <image>, <image>, <image> and <image>.

Solution (C++ code):
{solution}


assistant: ### Phase 3: Implement the Natural Language Invariants in C++

Based on the performance-characterizing invariants identified in natural language, we will create C++ functions to check these conditions at runtime.

#### C++ Code for Invariant Checkers

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>

// Example data structure used to count occurrences of elements.
std::unordered_map<int, int> elementFrequency;

// Check for repeated insertion and deletion of the same element
void check_repeated_element_operations(int element) {
    if (elementFrequency[element] > 10) {  // Arbitrary threshold for repeated operations
        std::cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to repeated insertions and deletions of the same element!" << std::endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Check for deep trie operations
void check_trie_depth_operations(unsigned int depth) {
    if (depth > 31) {  // Maximum depth based on 32-bit integers
        std::cerr << "Warning: Trie operations are reaching deep levels!" << std::endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Check for frequently executed XOR queries
void check_frequent_queries(int queryCount) {
    if (queryCount > 1000) {  // Arbitrary threshold for frequent queries
        std::cerr << "Warning: Too many XOR queries are executed consecutively!" << std::endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrate the Checkers into the Original Program

Now, we will integrate these checkers into the original C++ program. We will place the checks in appropriate places such as after reading the input and before performing insertion, deletion, or queries.

#### Instrumented C++ Code

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Define the node structure for the trie
struct node {
    int isend = 0;
    int cnt = 0;
    struct node* left;
    struct node* right;
};

// Global root node for the trie
node* root = new node();

// Function to create a new node
struct node* getnode() {
    struct node* cur = new node();
    cur->left = NULL;
    cur->right = NULL;
    return cur;
}

// Insert a binary string representation into the trie
void insert(struct node* root, string s) {
    struct node* cur = root;
    for (int i = 0; i < s.size(); ++i) {
        if (s[i] == '0') {
            if (cur->left == NULL) {
                cur->left = getnode();
            }
            cur->left->cnt++;
            cur = cur->left;
        } else {
            if (cur->right == NULL) {
                cur->right = getnode();
            }
            cur->right->cnt++;
            cur = cur->right;
        }
    }
    cur->isend++;
}

// Delete a binary string representation from the trie
void deleteit(struct node* root, string s) {
    struct node* cur = root;
    for (int i = 0; i < s.size(); ++i) {
        if (s[i] == '0') {
            cur->left->cnt--;
            if (cur->left->cnt == 0) {
                cur->left = NULL;
                break;
            } else
                cur = cur->left;
        } else {
            cur->right->cnt--;
            if (cur->right->cnt == 0) {
                cur->right = NULL;
                break;
            } else
                cur = cur->right;
        }
    }
}

// Find the maximum XOR of a given binary string with the trie
long long find(struct node* root, string s) {
    struct node* cur = root;
    long long ans = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < s.size(); ++i) {
        if (s[i] == '0') {
            if (cur->right != NULL) {
                ans += (1ll << (31 - i));
                cur = cur->right;
            } else if (cur->left != NULL) {
                cur = cur->left;
                continue;
            }
        } else {
            if (cur->left != NULL) {
                ans += (1ll << (31 - i));
                cur = cur->left;
            } else if (cur->right != NULL)
                cur = cur->right;
            continue;
        }
    }
    return ans;
}

// Convert an integer to a binary string representation
string get(int x) {
    string s = "";
    int sz = 0;
    while (x) {
        s = (char)(x % 2 + 48) + s;
        x /= 2;
        sz++;
    }
    while (sz <= 31) {
        s = '0' + s;
        sz++;
    }
    return s;
}

// Main function
int main() {
    int q;
    cin >> q;
    insert(root, get(0));

    int queryCounter = 0;

    while (q--) {
        char ch;
        cin >> ch;
        if (ch == '+') {
            long long x;
            cin >> x;
            elementFrequency[x]++;  // Track frequency of element
            check_repeated_element_operations(x);  // Check for repeated operations
            insert(root, get(x));
        }
        if (ch == '-') {
            long long x;
            cin >> x;
            elementFrequency[x]--;  // Track frequency of element
            check_repeated_element_operations(x);  // Check for repeated operations
            deleteit(root, get(x));
        } else if (ch == '?') {
            long long x;
            cin >> x;
            queryCounter++;
            check_frequent_queries(queryCounter);  // Check for frequent queries
            long long ans = find(root, get(x));
            if (ans == 0) ans = x;
            cout << ans << "\n";
        }
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation
- **Frequency Tracking:** We maintain an `elementFrequency` map to track how often each element is inserted or deleted, allowing us to detect excessive operations on the same element.
- **Trie Depth Monitoring:** As the trie depth based on binary strings is fixed for 32-bit integers, we set a depth threshold for operations.
- **Query Counter:** We use a counter to track the number of consecutive `?` queries to detect potential slowdowns from excessive querying.

Each invariant is integrated into the code to abort execution if a potential performance bottleneck condition is met, helping identify when the program might exhibit slow behavior.
