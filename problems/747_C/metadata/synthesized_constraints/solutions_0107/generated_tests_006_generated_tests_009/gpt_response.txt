### Phase 1: Identification of Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Hit Count Analysis**: 
   - The major difference in line-level hit counts between the slow and fast inputs is seen in lines 31-32 and lines 51-52. Specifically:
     - Line 31-32 (checking the free servers) has significantly higher hits in the slow input (54 times for the slow input vs. 18 times for the fast input).
     - Line 51-52 (decrementing the busy time of servers) has an extremely high hit count for both inputs, but it is notably higher in the slow input (9,029,997 vs. 3,009,999), indicating repeated checking and updating of server states.

2. **Potential Bottleneck Observations**:
   - **Loop Structure**: The loop over server states (lines 31-32 and 51-52) suggests that the program frequently accesses and iterates over the server list to check and update their states.
   - **Server Update Logic**: The logic at line 38-41 is often executed more for the slow input, indicating that tasks frequently require checking and updating of server availability.
   - **Task Processing and Server Assignment**: The frequent checks and modifications to server states suggest that the system's slowdown may be due to an inefficient server task allocation strategy, especially when many servers are involved in long-duration tasks.

### Phase 2: Deriving Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **High Number of Servers and Task Complexity**:
   - **Invariant**: "When the number of servers (n) is large and tasks have overlapping time frames, the frequent checking of server availability and status updates can cause performance degradation."
     - **Rationale**: With a larger number of servers, the nested loops (lines 31-32, 51-52) that frequently iterate over the server array can lead to inefficiencies, especially when tasks have overlapping durations that require continuous checking and updating of server states.

2. **Long-Duration Tasks**:
   - **Invariant**: "If tasks require servers to be busy for a long duration (di) relative to the frequency of incoming tasks, the continuous decrementing of busy time for multiple servers may degrade performance."
     - **Rationale**: The server status update (lines 51-52) occurs at every simulation step, and with long-duration tasks, servers remain occupied longer, leading to repeated and costly updates in every cycle.

3. **Frequent Full Utilization of Servers**:
   - **Invariant**: "When tasks frequently require using all available servers, the system's overhead in attempting to allocate, check, and update servers increases, potentially leading to slower execution times."
     - **Rationale**: This condition results in maximum iterations across the server list to verify and update their availability, which is expensive when tasks are densely packed or require many servers simultaneously.

These performance-characterizing invariants help clarify when and why the program might slow down, providing valuable insights into how the problem structure and input characteristics can lead to performance issues.

### Phase 3: Implementing Invariants as Runtime Checks in C++

Based on the performance-characterizing invariants derived earlier, we'll write C++ code snippets that implement these checks:

#### Invariant 1: High Number of Servers and Task Complexity
```cpp
void check_server_allocation_invariant(int n, int k) {
    if (n > 50 && k > n / 2) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - High server allocation!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

#### Invariant 2: Long-Duration Tasks
```cpp
void check_long_duration_invariant(int di) {
    if (di > 500) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - Task duration too long!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

#### Invariant 3: Frequent Full Utilization of Servers
```cpp
void check_full_utilization_invariant(int free, int k) {
    if (free < k) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - Frequent full server utilization!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrating Checkers into the Original Program

Now, let's integrate these checks into the original C++ program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

struct task {
    int t, k, d;
    task() {}
    task(int a, int b, int c) {
        t = a;
        k = b;
        d = c;
    }
};

// Checkers for performance bottleneck conditions
void check_server_allocation_invariant(int n, int k) {
    if (n > 50 && k > n / 2) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - High server allocation!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_long_duration_invariant(int di) {
    if (di > 500) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - Task duration too long!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_full_utilization_invariant(int free, int k) {
    if (free < k) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - Frequent full server utilization!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    int n, q;
    cin >> n >> q;
    vector<task> v(q);
    int a, b, c;
    for (int i = 0; i < q; ++i) {
        cin >> a >> b >> c;
        v[i] = task(a, b, c);
    }
    reverse(v.begin(), v.end());
    vector<int> servers(n, 0);
    for (int i = 1; i <= 1e6 + 3333; ++i) {
        if (v.size()) {
            task cur = v.back();
            a = cur.t;
            b = cur.k;
            c = cur.d;
            
            // Check server allocation invariant
            check_server_allocation_invariant(n, b);
            // Check long duration invariant
            check_long_duration_invariant(c);

            if (a == i) {
                int free = 0;
                for (int j = 0; j < servers.size(); ++j) {
                    if (!servers[j]) free++;
                }
                
                // Check full utilization invariant
                check_full_utilization_invariant(free, b);

                int tot = b;
                int sum = 0;
                if (free >= b) {
                    for (int j = 0; j < servers.size() && tot > 0; ++j) {
                        if (servers[j] == 0) {
                            servers[j] = c;
                            sum += j + 1;
                            tot--;
                        }
                    }
                    cout << sum << '\n';
                } else {
                    cout << -1 << '\n';
                }
                v.pop_back();
            }
        }
        for (int j = 0; j < servers.size(); ++j) {
            if (servers[j] > 0) servers[j]--;
        }
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation
- **Placement of Checks**: The checks are strategically placed:
  - `check_server_allocation_invariant` and `check_long_duration_invariant` are invoked before attempting to allocate servers, ensuring that expensive conditions are flagged early.
  - `check_full_utilization_invariant` is placed after calculating available servers `free` and before deciding on task execution to catch any problematic full utilization scenarios.

- **Thresholds**: The thresholds used (e.g., `n > 50`, `di > 500`) are meant to capture scenarios where performance might degrade, while still accommodating the constraints of the problem (like `n` and `di` being relatively small). These are chosen for demonstration but can be adjusted based on empirical tuning.
