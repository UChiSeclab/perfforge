### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

Based on the hit count information, we can identify which parts of the program are being executed more frequently in the slow input compared to the fast input:

1. **Lines 26-28 (while loop and for loop):** 
   - The `while` loop is executed 1,000,001 times for the slow input compared to only 7 times for the fast input. This is due to the large value of `t` in the slow input (1,000,000) and the requirement to iterate over time until all tasks are considered.
   - The `for` loop inside the `while` loop (line 28) iterates 101,000,000 times for the slow input compared to 18 times for the fast input. This is directly related to the number of servers (`n`) and the number of times the loop iterates for each time unit.

2. **Line 29 (inside for loop):** 
   - The condition `if (serv[i].end == t)` is checked 100,000,000 times for the slow input. This line checks if servers are becoming available as time progresses.

3. **Line 35 (checking arrival of tasks):**
   - The condition `if (t == arry[k][0])` is checked 1,000,000 times. This examines whether a task arrives at the current time `t`.

These observations highlight that the program's performance bottleneck is related to handling tasks over a prolonged period with many servers, causing excessive looping.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the analysis of the code and the identified bottlenecks, we can derive conditions that characterize when the program is likely to slow down:

1. **Invariant 1: Large Time Span with High Task Time Requirement**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "If tasks arrive over a large time span and require servers to be occupied for many time units, especially if the time span is significantly larger than the number of servers, the program may slow down due to frequent iterations over time and server states."
   
2. **Invariant 2: High Server Utilization with Large Number of Servers**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "If the number of servers (`n`) is large and tasks require constant checking of server availability, especially with maximal or close to the maximum number of servers (`n`), this can lead to a performance degradation as each task arrival involves checking the status of all servers."

3. **Invariant 3: Repeated Server Status Updates**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "If the program frequently updates the server status over a prolonged period, particularly when the period of interest (`t`) is substantially larger than the number of servers (`n`), the cumulative overhead can cause significant slowdowns."

These invariants capture the conditions that lead to slower performance, focusing on the interaction between time, the number of servers, and task durations. The mentioned thresholds align with the problem's constraints (`n <= 100` and `t` can be very large).

### Phase 3: Implement the Natural Language Invariants in C++

Based on the performance-characterizing invariants we derived, here are the C++ checkers to implement them:

#### Invariant 1: Large Time Span with High Task Time Requirement

```cpp
void check_large_timespan_invariant(long long t, long long max_t, int n) {
    if (t > max_t * 10 && n > 50) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large time span with high task time requirement!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

#### Invariant 2: High Server Utilization with Large Number of Servers

```cpp
void check_server_utilization_invariant(int n, long long servcnt) {
    if (servcnt < n / 2 && n > 50) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high server utilization with a large number of servers!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

#### Invariant 3: Repeated Server Status Updates

```cpp
void check_repeated_updates_invariant(long long t, int n) {
    if (t > 100000 && n > 50) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - repeated server status updates over large time!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrate the Checker Code into the Original C++ Program

Here is the instrumented C++ code with the checkers integrated at appropriate points:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

void fastio() {
    ios::sync_with_stdio(NULL);
    cin.tie(NULL);
    cout.tie(NULL);
}

struct rec {
    long long flg;
    long long end;
};

void check_large_timespan_invariant(long long t, long long max_t, int n) {
    if (t > max_t * 10 && n > 50) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large time span with high task time requirement!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_server_utilization_invariant(int n, long long servcnt) {
    if (servcnt < n / 2 && n > 50) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high server utilization with a large number of servers!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_repeated_updates_invariant(long long t, int n) {
    if (t > 100000 && n > 50) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - repeated server status updates over large time!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    fastio();
    long long i, j, n, q;
    cin >> n >> q;
    struct rec serv[n + 1];
    long long arry[q][3];
    for (i = 0; i < q; i++) cin >> arry[i][0] >> arry[i][1] >> arry[i][2];
    for (i = 0; i < n + 1; i++) {
        serv[i].flg = 0;
        serv[i].end = -5;
    }
    long long t = 0;
    long long k = 0;
    long long servcnt = n;
    
    // Check invariants before starting the main loop
    check_large_timespan_invariant(arry[q-1][0], 100000, n);
    
    while (k != q) {
        t++;
        check_repeated_updates_invariant(t, n);
        for (i = 1; i < n + 1; i++) {
            if (serv[i].end == t) {
                serv[i].flg = 0;
                serv[i].end = -5;
                servcnt++;
            }
        }
        if (t == arry[k][0]) {
            check_server_utilization_invariant(n, servcnt);
            if (servcnt < arry[k][1]) {
                cout << -1 << endl;
                k++;
            } else {
                long long scnt = arry[k][1];
                long long ans = 0;
                for (i = 1; i < n + 1; i++) {
                    if (serv[i].flg == 0) {
                        serv[i].flg = 1;
                        serv[i].end = arry[k][2] + t;
                        ans += i;
                        scnt--;
                        if (scnt == 0) {
                            break;
                        }
                    }
                }
                cout << ans << endl;
                servcnt -= arry[k][1];
                k++;
            }
        }
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of Inserted Checks

1. **`check_large_timespan_invariant`:** This is called before the `while` loop to ensure that we aren't entering a scenario where tasks span a very large time period compared to the number of servers.

2. **`check_server_utilization_invariant`:** Placed inside the task processing logic, this checks if server utilization is excessively high relative to the number of servers available.

3. **`check_repeated_updates_invariant`:** This is invoked at every iteration of the `while` loop to guard against excessive looping beyond a reasonable time threshold. 

These checks are designed to help identify potential bottlenecks and optimize the execution paths within the constraints of the problem.
