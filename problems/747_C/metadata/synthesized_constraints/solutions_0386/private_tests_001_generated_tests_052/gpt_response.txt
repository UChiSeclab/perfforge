=== Invariants Response ===
To diagnose the performance bottlenecks and derive performance-characterizing invariants, let's start by analyzing the code and hit count information.

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

Based on the provided hit counts:

- **Line 14 (`for (int l = t; l < t + d; l++)`)** and **Line 15 (`bisa = (bisa && s[j][l]);`)** are hit 100,000 times during the slow input run. This indicates that this nested loop is a major contributor to the slowed performance. The loop iterates over the time duration `d` for each server `j`.

- **Line 12 (`for (int j = 0; j < n; j++)`)** with 101 hits suggests that the outer loop iterates over all servers, further amplifying the cost of the inner loop.

- **Lines 23 (`for (int l = t; l < t + d; l++)`)** and **24 (`s[v[j]][l] = false;`)** also have a high number of hits, indicating that marking servers as busy is similarly expensive.

This indicates that the bottleneck occurs due to the high number of checks performed for each task over the entire duration `d` and across all servers `n`.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the analysis, here are the natural language performance invariants:

1. **Server Availability Check Invariant:**
   - "If the number of servers `n` is large and the duration `d` is also large, the checks for server availability become expensive. This occurs because the algorithm checks each server over the entire duration of each task, leading to a significant number of operations."

2. **Server Marking Invariant:**
   - "If tasks frequently require marking servers as busy for a long duration `d` relative to the number of servers `n`, the operations to update server states become costly. This is particularly noticeable when the combination of `n` and `d` results in repeated and extended state changes."

3. **Task Overlap Invariant:**
   - "When consecutive tasks have overlapping durations, and the number of servers `n` is insufficient to handle all tasks concurrently, the increased frequency of server state checks and updates can slow down the program. This is especially true when `d` is large relative to the availability of free servers."

To avoid concrete values from slow input, these descriptions focus on the abstract conditions causing slowness, such as the combination of large `n`, `d`, and overlapping tasks.

### Conclusion

The identified inefficiencies are primarily related to nested loops iterating over large combinations of servers and time durations. By understanding these performance-characterizing invariants, one can anticipate and optimize against potential slowdowns in future inputs with similar characteristics.

### Phase 3: Implement the Natural Language Invariants in C++

Below, I provide C++ code implementing the performance-checking invariants derived previously:

#### 1. Server Availability Check Invariant
This invariant checks if the number of servers `n` combined with the duration `d` leads to expensive server availability checks.
```cpp
void check_server_availability_invariant(int n, int d) {
    if (n * d > 10000) { // Threshold can be adjusted based on expected load
        cerr << "Warning: Server availability check invariant triggered - high check frequency!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

#### 2. Server Marking Invariant
This invariant checks if updating server states for a long `d` is costly.
```cpp
void check_server_marking_invariant(int n, int d) {
    if (n * d > 10000) { // Threshold can be adjusted based on expected load
        cerr << "Warning: Server marking invariant triggered - frequent state updates!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

#### 3. Task Overlap Invariant
This invariant checks for potential performance issues caused by overlapping tasks.
```cpp
void check_task_overlap_invariant(int n, int d, int k) {
    if ((n - k) * d < 0) { // If k servers are needed but n-k is small, causing overlap
        cerr << "Warning: Task overlap invariant triggered - insufficient free servers!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrate the Checks into the Original Program

Now, let's integrate these checks into the original C++ program. I'll place the checks at strategic points in the code to avoid overhead in tight loops.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Checker functions
void check_server_availability_invariant(int n, int d) {
    if (n * d > 10000) { // Threshold can be adjusted based on expected load
        cerr << "Warning: Server availability check invariant triggered - high check frequency!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_server_marking_invariant(int n, int d) {
    if (n * d > 10000) { // Threshold can be adjusted based on expected load
        cerr << "Warning: Server marking invariant triggered - frequent state updates!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_task_overlap_invariant(int n, int d, int k) {
    if ((n - k) * d < 0) { // If k servers are needed, but n-k is small, causing overlap
        cerr << "Warning: Task overlap invariant triggered - insufficient free servers!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

bool s[105][1001005];
int n, q;
int t, k, d;

int main() {
    scanf("%d%d", &n, &q);
    memset(s, true, sizeof s);

    for (int i = 0; i < q; i++) {
        scanf("%d%d%d", &t, &k, &d);

        // Check performance invariants
        check_server_availability_invariant(n, d);
        check_server_marking_invariant(n, d);
        check_task_overlap_invariant(n, d, k);

        vector<int> v;
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            bool bisa = true;
            for (int l = t; l < t + d; l++) {
                bisa = (bisa && s[j][l]);
            }
            if (bisa) v.push_back(j);
        }
        if (v.size() >= k) {
            int sum = 0;
            for (int j = 0; j < k; j++) {
                sum += v[j] + 1;
                for (int l = t; l < t + d; l++) {
                    s[v[j]][l] = false;
                }
            }
            printf("%d\n", sum);
        } else {
            printf("-1\n");
        }
    }
}
```

In this integrated code:

- **Performance checks** are added right after reading the input for each task set, before the expensive loops and calculations, to detect potential bottlenecks early without adding overhead to tight execution paths.
- **Thresholds** are set based on expected load scenarios. Adjust these thresholds according to specific performance goals and test results.
