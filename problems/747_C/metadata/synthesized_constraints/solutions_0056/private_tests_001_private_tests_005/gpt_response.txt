### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

Upon analyzing the line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs, we can pinpoint areas where performance bottlenecks occur:

1. **Function `settFree`**:
   - **Line 6** (`for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i)`): This line is hit 101,000,000 times in the slow run compared to 30 times in the fast run. It's part of a nested loop that checks each second if a server is free by comparing it to an array `s` that marks the time until each server is busy.
   - **Line 7** (`if (sec == s[i]) s[i] = 0;`): This condition checks and resets each server's busy status. In the slow run, it's executed 100,000,000 times, indicating extensive and repeated processing.

2. **Loop in `main`**:
   - **Line 35** (`for (int i = 1; i <= maxx; ++i)`): This loop iterates over each second until the last task time `maxx`. It runs 1,000,001 times for the slow input, reflecting the high task time.

This analysis suggests that the main performance bottleneck arises from processing each second of time, especially when the task time `ti` is large, leading to extensive iterations and checks even when no task occurs at most times.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the identified bottlenecks, we can now generate natural language descriptions of the conditions under which the code tends to slow down:

1. **High Task Time (`ti`) and Long Duration (`di`)**:
   - **Invariant**: When the task time `ti` is significantly large in comparison to the number of servers `n`, and the duration `di` is considerable, the function `settFree` repeatedly iterates through time units without actual task processing, leading to inefficiencies.
   - **Natural Language Description**: "If the time `ti` is extensively large and duration `di` is long, the program may enter a time-intensive loop checking server availability unnecessarily, thus slowing performance."

2. **Excessive Loop Iterations Over Time**:
   - **Invariant**: If `maxx`, the maximum task time, is significantly large with respect to the number of tasks `q`, the main loop will iterate over many time units with minimal task processing, causing a substantial overhead.
   - **Natural Language Description**: "When the maximum task time `maxx` is substantially larger than the number of tasks `q`, the program may undergo excessive iteration over time units, leading to redundant operations and slow execution."

These statements encapsulate scenarios where the program becomes inefficient due to the nature of the input, particularly related to time and duration, without relying on specific numeric values from the slow input, respecting the constraints of `n <= 100` and `q <= 100,000`.

### Phase 3: Implement Performance-Characterizing Invariants as Checker Code in C++

Based on the natural language invariants derived, we will implement two checker functions to detect potential performance bottlenecks.

1. **Invariant Check for High Task Time (`ti`) and Long Duration (`di`)**:
   - We will create a checker to ensure that if the task time `ti` is significantly large relative to a reasonable threshold (e.g., `10^6` seconds) and simultaneously if the duration `di` is lengthy, we will recognize this as a potential bottleneck. 

2. **Invariant Check for Excessive Loop Iterations Over Time**:
   - We will place a checker to ensure that if the maximum task time `maxx` significantly exceeds the number of tasks `q`, it indicates excessive iterations over non-task time points.

Here is the C++ code for these checkers:

```cpp
void check_task_time_invariant(int ti, int di) {
    if (ti > 1000000 && di > 500) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high task time and long duration!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_excessive_iterations_invariant(int maxx, int q) {
    if (maxx > 10 * q) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive loop iterations over time!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrate Checker Code with the Original Program

Now, we will integrate these checkers into the original C++ code. The check for high task time and long duration will be inserted after reading each task input, and the check for excessive iterations will be inserted after processing all tasks to determine `maxx`.

Here is the instrumented C++ program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int k[1000005], d[1000005], s[1000005], n, q, maxx, freee;
int ti, ki, di;

// Checker function for high task time and long duration
void check_task_time_invariant(int ti, int di) {
    if (ti > 1000000 && di > 500) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high task time and long duration!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Checker function for excessive loop iterations
void check_excessive_iterations_invariant(int maxx, int q) {
    if (maxx > 10 * q) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive loop iterations over time!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void settFree(int sec) {
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i)
        if (sec == s[i]) s[i] = 0;
}

int countFree() {
    int ret = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i)
        if (!s[i]) ++ret;
    return ret;
}

int getAns(int sec, int cnt, int time) {
    int ret = 0, solved = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        if (!s[i]) {
            s[i] = sec + time;
            ret += i;
            ++solved;
            if (solved == cnt) return ret;
        }
    }
    return ret;
}

int main() {
    scanf("%d %d", &n, &q);
    for (int i = 1; i <= q; ++i) {
        scanf("%d %d %d", &ti, &ki, &di);
        k[ti] = ki;
        d[ti] = di;
        maxx = max(maxx, ti);

        // Check for high task time and long duration
        check_task_time_invariant(ti, di);
    }

    // Check for excessive iterations based on maxx and q
    check_excessive_iterations_invariant(maxx, q);

    for (int i = 1; i <= maxx; ++i) {
        settFree(i);
        if (!k[i]) continue;
        freee = countFree();
        if (freee < k[i]) {
            printf("-1\n");
            continue;
        }
        printf("%d\n", getAns(i, k[i], d[i]));
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

- **Task Time and Duration Check**: The checker `check_task_time_invariant` verifies each task's time and duration right after reading the task input. If both conditions are met, it issues a warning and aborts.
- **Excessive Iterations Check**: The checker `check_excessive_iterations_invariant` is placed after the task inputs are processed to evaluate whether the system is likely to perform excessive iterations over time slots.

These checks help ensure that performance bottlenecks are identified early, and they efficiently integrate into the existing program without adding overhead to performance-critical loops.
