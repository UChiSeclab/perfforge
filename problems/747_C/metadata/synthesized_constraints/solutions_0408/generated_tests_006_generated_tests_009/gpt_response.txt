### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Analysis of Hit Counts:**
   - The loop on line 20 runs `1,000,000` times for both inputs, which is expected due to the hardcoded loop limit.
   - Line 23 and lines 24-25 are executed `8,999,946` times for the slow input, but only `2,999,982` times for the fast input, indicating a significant performance difference.
   - Line 41 and lines 42-48 have significantly higher hit counts for the slow input (`45` vs `6` for line 41 and `40` vs `4` for line 42), showing that task execution logic is hit more often in the slow input.

2. **Inferences:**
   - The nested loop within the loop on line 23 suggests that performance issues may arise when the task processing involves many servers, leading to frequent updates and checks on server states.
   - The high hit counts on lines 42-45 (conditional and execution logic) indicate that tasks are being executed more frequently or with more iterations in the slow input.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **Natural Language Performance Invariants:**

   - **Invariant 1: Frequent Server Reuse in Task Execution**
     - Description: "When tasks frequently require a large number of servers close to the total number available (`n`) and these servers are repeatedly occupied and released, task scheduling becomes inefficient due to the need to constantly update the server states."

   - **Invariant 2: High Server Utilization**
     - Description: "The program experiences slowdowns when tasks arrive closely together in time (`ti`) and require substantial server occupancy (`di`), leading to contention and frequent server status updates."

   - **Invariant 3: Large Task Requirements**
     - Description: "The execution pace diminishes significantly when many tasks request a number of servers (`ki`) close to the maximum available (`n`), increasing the likelihood of tasks being ignored or causing a high number of conditional checks."

2. **Thresholds and Conditions:**
   - These invariants are characterized by situations where `ki` and `di` values are high relative to `n`, and tasks arrive in quick succession, causing overlapping in server usage.
   - The conditions are not based on specific numeric values but rather on relationships between the parameters and the constraints provided (`n <= 100`).

These invariants capture the fundamental issues affecting performance â€“ namely, the inefficient handling of server availability and frequent state updates under specific input patterns. By monitoring these conditions, potential slowdowns can be identified and addressed more effectively.

### Phase 3: Implementing Invariants in C++

Let's translate the natural language performance invariants into C++ checker code:

1. **Invariant 1: Frequent Server Reuse in Task Execution**
   - Checker Code:
   ```cpp
   void check_frequent_server_reuse(int n, int ki, int tot, int di) {
       if (ki > n / 2 && di > n && tot < ki) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to frequent server reuse triggered!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Invariant 2: High Server Utilization**
   - Checker Code:
   ```cpp
   void check_high_server_utilization(int ti, int previous_ti, int di) {
       if (ti - previous_ti < di / 2) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to high server utilization triggered!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Invariant 3: Large Task Requirements**
   - Checker Code:
   ```cpp
   void check_large_task_requirements(int n, int ki, int q) {
       if (ki > n * 0.8 && q > 0.8 * 100000) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to large task requirements triggered!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Integrating Checkers into the Original Program

Now let's integrate these checkers into the provided C++ code.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
const int N = 1e6 + 5;
const int M = 4e5 + 5;
int n, m, k, tot = 0;
struct man {
  int k, d;
} a[N];

void check_frequent_server_reuse(int n, int ki, int tot, int di) {
    if (ki > n / 2 && di > n && tot < ki) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to frequent server reuse triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_high_server_utilization(int ti, int previous_ti, int di) {
    if (ti - previous_ti < di / 2) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to high server utilization triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_large_task_requirements(int n, int ki, int q) {
    if (ki > n * 0.8 && q > 0.8 * 100000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to large task requirements triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
  int mark[105];
  memset(mark, 0, sizeof mark);
  int s, t, t1, t2, p, dir;
  scanf("%d%d", &n, &m);

  int previous_ti = 0; // Track previous task time for high utilization check
  while (m--) {
    scanf("%d%d%d", &s, &t, &t1);
    a[s].k = t;
    a[s].d = t1;

    // Check for large task requirements
    check_large_task_requirements(n, t, m);
  }

  tot = n;
  for (int i = 1; i <= 1000000; i++) {
    if (!a[i].k) {
      tot = 0;
      for (int j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
        if (mark[j]) mark[j]--;
        if (mark[j] < 1) tot++;
      }
      continue;
    }

    // Check for frequent server reuse
    check_frequent_server_reuse(n, a[i].k, tot, a[i].d);

    if (tot < a[i].k) {
      printf("-1\n");
      tot = 0;
      for (int j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
        if (mark[j]) mark[j]--;
        if (mark[j] < 1) tot++;
      }
      continue;
    } else {
      tot = 0;
      p = a[i].k;
      int sum = 0;
      for (int j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
        if (mark[j] == 0 && p != 0) {
          mark[j] = a[i].d;
          sum += j;
          p--;
        }
        if (mark[j]) mark[j]--;
        if (mark[j] < 1) tot++;
      }
      printf("%d\n", sum);
    }

    // Check for high server utilization
    check_high_server_utilization(i, previous_ti, a[i].d);
    previous_ti = i; // Update previous time
  }
  return 0;
}
```

### Comments on Integration:

- **Frequent Server Reuse Check:** Added before the task is processed to ensure sufficient unoccupied servers are available.
- **High Server Utilization Check:** Added to ensure tasks don't arrive too close together, considering server occupation duration.
- **Large Task Requirements Check:** Added during task input to flag potential issues based on task size and number of tasks.
