system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

Jeff's friends know full well that the boy likes to get sequences and arrays for his birthday. Thus, Jeff got sequence p1, p2, ..., pn for his birthday.

Jeff hates inversions in sequences. An inversion in sequence a1, a2, ..., an is a pair of indexes i, j (1 ≤ i < j ≤ n), such that an inequality ai > aj holds.

Jeff can multiply some numbers of the sequence p by -1. At that, he wants the number of inversions in the sequence to be minimum. Help Jeff and find the minimum number of inversions he manages to get.

Input

The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000). The next line contains n integers — sequence p1, p2, ..., pn (|pi| ≤ 105). The numbers are separated by spaces.

Output

In a single line print the answer to the problem — the minimum number of inversions Jeff can get.

assistant: To analyze the performance bottleneck in the given C program, let's break down the code in the context of its hit counts and the nature of the task it solves.

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Line Hit Counts Analysis:**
   - The `get` function is notably called a much higher number of times in the slow input (5023 hits) compared to the fast input (95 hits).
   - The `add` function is also frequently called, with significant differences between the slow (1817 hits) and fast inputs (33 hits).
   - The loops in `main` (lines 26-36) are run more times in the slow input due to larger `n`.

2. **Inefficient Segments:**
   - **Segment Tree Operations:** The primary performance bottleneck is the repeated querying and updating of a segment tree through the `get` and `add` functions. The segment tree is used to count inversions by maintaining frequency counts of elements.
   - **Loop Structure:** The nested usage of the `get` function twice per element in the list (lines 29, 30, 34) results in high computational overhead as `n` increases.

3. **Data Interaction:**
   - **Input Size Influence:** While both inputs have similar constraints, the number of unique elements and their distribution affect the segment tree's function invocations. This leads to different performance characteristics.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Here are some natural language invariants that describe when the code slows down:

1. **High Frequency of Segment Tree Operations:**
   - "When the sequence contains a large number of unique elements resulting in many updates and queries to the segment tree, the program may experience significant slowdowns."
   - **Reasoning:** The segment tree must handle and resolve more entries, increasing computational overhead with larger `n` and complex distributions.

2. **Complex Distribution of Sequence Elements:**
   - "If the sequence contains elements that frequently transition between positive and negative, leading to many potential inversions, the computational effort needed to minimize inversions increases."
   - **Reasoning:** Minimizing inversions requires more segment tree operations when elements are closer in value or interspersed positively and negatively.

3. **Input Size and Distribution:**
   - "When the input size is large, close to the upper bound (n approaching 2000), and contains many elements close together in value, the number of inversion checks and updates increases."
   - **Reasoning:** The proximity in value increases the likelihood of inversions, necessitating more segment tree operations for adjustments.

4. **Repeated Operations in Nested Loops:**
   - "If a nested loop involves repeated segment tree operations for each element of a significantly large sequence, the performance will degrade as operations scale with input size."
   - **Reasoning:** Each element's processing requires tree updates and queries, and nested loop structures compound the number of operations exponentially in relation to `n`.

These invariants highlight key conditions that cause performance degradation, without relying on specific values from the slow input, instead focusing on broad characteristics like input size, element distribution, and operation frequency.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
Jeff's friends know full well that the boy likes to get sequences and arrays for his birthday. Thus, Jeff got sequence p1, p2, ..., pn for his birthday.

Jeff hates inversions in sequences. An inversion in sequence a1, a2, ..., an is a pair of indexes i, j (1 ≤ i < j ≤ n), such that an inequality ai > aj holds.

Jeff can multiply some numbers of the sequence p by -1. At that, he wants the number of inversions in the sequence to be minimum. Help Jeff and find the minimum number of inversions he manages to get.

Input

The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000). The next line contains n integers — sequence p1, p2, ..., pn (|pi| ≤ 105). The numbers are separated by spaces.

Output

In a single line print the answer to the problem — the minimum number of inversions Jeff can get.

assistant: Let's proceed with Phase 3 and Phase 4.

### Phase 3: Implementing the Natural Language Invariants in C++

Here are the C++ implementations of the performance-characterizing invariants we previously identified:

1. **High Frequency of Segment Tree Operations:**
   ```cpp
   void check_segment_tree_operations(int operationCount, int threshold) {
       if (operationCount > threshold) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - too many segment tree operations!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Complex Distribution of Sequence Elements:**
   ```cpp
   void check_complex_distribution(int uniqueCount, int n) {
       if (uniqueCount > n / 2) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - complex distribution of sequence elements!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Input Size and Distribution:**
   ```cpp
   void check_input_size(int n, int threshold) {
       if (n > threshold) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large input size!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

4. **Repeated Operations in Nested Loops:**
   ```cpp
   void check_repeated_operations(int n, int threshold) {
       if (n > threshold) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - repeated operations in nested loops!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Integrating Checker Code with the Original Program

Now, let's integrate the checker functions into the existing C++ program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
const int maxn = 2005, maxm = 1e5 + 5;
int a[maxn], b[maxn], seg[4 * maxm];

// Checker functions
void check_segment_tree_operations(int operationCount, int threshold) {
    if (operationCount > threshold) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - too many segment tree operations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_complex_distribution(int uniqueCount, int n) {
    if (uniqueCount > n / 2) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - complex distribution of sequence elements!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_input_size(int n, int threshold) {
    if (n > threshold) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large input size!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_repeated_operations(int n, int threshold) {
    if (n > threshold) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - repeated operations in nested loops!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void add(int id, int L, int R, int idx, int x) {
    if (idx < L || idx >= R) return;
    if (R == L + 1) {
        seg[id] += x;

### Explanation

- **Input Size Check (`check_input_size`)**: This check ensures the program does not run with an unexpectedly large input size.
  
- **Segment Tree Operations Check (`check_segment_tree_operations`)**: This is placed after the first loop to ensure excessive operations on the segment tree are not degrading performance.

- **Complex Distribution Check (`check_complex_distribution`)**: This check is based on the number of unique elements in the sequence after input processing.

- **Repeated Operations Check (`check_repeated_operations`)**: Though not directly added, the above checks inherently account for repeated operations by limiting the complexity through input size and operation counts.

These checks help ensure that performance bottlenecks are detected early in the program's execution, providing valuable feedback for further optimization and testing.
