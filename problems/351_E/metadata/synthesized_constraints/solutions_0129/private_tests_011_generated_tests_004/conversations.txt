system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

Jeff's friends know full well that the boy likes to get sequences and arrays for his birthday. Thus, Jeff got sequence p1, p2, ..., pn for his birthday.

Jeff hates inversions in sequences. An inversion in sequence a1, a2, ..., an is a pair of indexes i, j (1 ≤ i < j ≤ n), such that an inequality ai > aj holds.

Jeff can multiply some numbers of the sequence p by -1. At that, he wants the number of inversions in the sequence to be minimum. Help Jeff and find the minimum number of inversions he manages to get.

Input

The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000). The next line contains n integers — sequence p1, p2, ..., pn (|pi| ≤ 105). The numbers are separated by spaces.

Output

In a single line print the answer to the problem — the minimum number of inversions Jeff can get.

assistant: To analyze the performance bottlenecks in the given C code, we can use the hit count information from both the fast and slow inputs to identify areas where the slow input causes significantly more processing. This will help us generate performance-characterizing invariants.

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Bubble Sort Implementation (Lines 16-22):**
   - **Observation:** The nested loops (lines 16-22) for sorting based on absolute values have significantly higher hit counts for the slow input (961 vs. 64 for `j` loop). This indicates that sorting is a major contributor to the slowdown.
   - **Interaction with Data:** The bubble sort complexity is O(N^2), which can become bottlenecks for larger N.

2. **Nested Loop for `L` and `U` Calculation (Lines 31-39):**
   - **Observation:** The inner loop (line 32) shows a significant increase in hit counts for the slow input (321 vs. 29). This indicates that computing `L` and `U` involves a lot of comparisons and may become inefficient as `pos` grows.
   - **Interaction with Data:** The loop relies on `pos`, which represents groups of elements with the same absolute value.

3. **DP Table Updates (Lines 42-51):**
   - **Observation:** The loops for updating the DP table (lines 46-49) also have increased hit counts (237 vs. 23). This suggests that dynamic programming operations are being executed many more times for the slow input.
   - **Interaction with Data:** The operations depend on `M` (number of elements with the same absolute value), leading to increased complexity when `M` is large.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the above analysis, we can derive the following natural language performance invariants:

1. **Invariant #1: Sorting Complexity**
   - **Description:** "When the input sequence contains a large number of elements with varied absolute values, the bubble sort's O(N^2) complexity can lead to a significant performance slowdown."
   - **Trigger:** High presence of distinct absolute values in the input sequence.

2. **Invariant #2: Grouping by Absolute Values**
   - **Description:** "If the sequence contains many elements with the same absolute value, the initial grouping logic and subsequent calculations for `L` and `U` can become computationally expensive."
   - **Trigger:** Large groups of elements sharing the same absolute value, leading to increased `pos` and `M` values.

3. **Invariant #3: Dynamic Programming Table Updates**
   - **Description:** "When the input includes large consecutive segments of elements with similar absolute values, the dynamic programming table updates may become a bottleneck due to repeated calculations for large `M`."
   - **Trigger:** Extended runs of elements with identical absolute values, causing increased complexity in the DP logic.

These invariants focus on the relationship between the input data's structure and the operational complexity of the code, identifying scenarios that can lead to performance degradation.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Jeff hates inversions in sequences. An inversion in sequence a1, a2, ..., an is a pair of indexes i, j (1 ≤ i < j ≤ n), such that an inequality ai > aj holds.

Jeff can multiply some numbers of the sequence p by -1. At that, he wants the number of inversions in the sequence to be minimum. Help Jeff and find the minimum number of inversions he manages to get.

Input

The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000). The next line contains n integers — sequence p1, p2, ..., pn (|pi| ≤ 105). The numbers are separated by spaces.

Output

In a single line print the answer to the problem — the minimum number of inversions Jeff can get.

assistant: ### Phase 3: Implementing Natural Language Invariants in C++

Here, we'll convert the previously identified performance-characterizing invariants into C++ runtime checks.

1. **Invariant for Sorting Complexity:**
   - **Checker Code:**
     ```cpp
     void check_sort_complexity(bool condition) {
         if (condition) {
             cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high sorting operations!" << endl;
             abort();
         }
     }
     ```

2. **Invariant for Grouping by Absolute Values:**
   - **Checker Code:**
     ```cpp
     void check_grouping_complexity(bool condition) {
         if (condition) {
             cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large grouping by absolute values!" << endl;
             abort();
         }
     }
     ```

3. **Invariant for Dynamic Programming Table Updates:**
   - **Checker Code:**
     ```cpp
     void check_dp_update_complexity(bool condition) {
         if (condition) {
             cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - costly DP table updates!" << endl;
             abort();
         }
     }
     ```

### Phase 4: Propagate and Insert Conditional Checks

Next, we integrate the performance checkers into the original C++ program at strategic locations.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
const long long inf = 1e15;
const long long mod = 1000 * 1000 * 1000 + 7;
const int maxn = 2010;
long long DP[2][maxn];

// Function to check sorting complexity
void check_sort_complexity(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high sorting operations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Function to check grouping complexity
void check_grouping_complexity(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large grouping by absolute values!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Function to check DP update complexity
void check_dp_update_complexity(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - costly DP table updates!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    int N;
    cin >> N;
    vector<int> P(N);
    vector<int> I(N);
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        cin >> P[i];
        I[i] = i;
    }
    
    // Check sort complexity before the bubble sort
    check_sort_complexity(N > 1000); // Arbitrary threshold for triggering the sort check
    
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
        for (int j = 0; j < N - 1; j++) {
            if (abs(P[j]) > abs(P[j + 1])) {
                swap(P[j], P[j + 1]);
                swap(I[j], I[j + 1]);
            }
        }

    long long ans = 0;
    int pos = 0;
    while (pos < N) {
        int npos = pos;
        while (npos < N && abs(P[npos]) == abs(P[pos])) npos++;
        int M = npos - pos;

        // Check grouping complexity
        check_grouping_complexity(M > 500); // Arbitrary threshold for large group size

        vector<long long> L(M, 0);
        vector<long long> U(M, 0);
        for (int i = 0; i < M; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < pos; j++) {
                if (I[j] < I[pos + i]) {
                    L[i]++;
                } else {
                    U[i]++;
                }
            }
        }
        fill(&DP[0][0], &DP[0][0] + 2 * maxn, inf);
        DP[0][0] = 0;

        // Check DP update complexity
        check_dp_update_complexity(M > 500); // Arbitrary threshold for DP update complexity

        for (int i = 0; i < M; i++) {
            int cur = i % 2;
            int nxt = 1 - cur;
            fill(&DP[nxt][0], &DP[nxt][0] + maxn, inf);
            for (int j = 0; j < i + 1; j++)
                if (DP[cur][j] < inf) {
                    DP[nxt][j] = min(DP[nxt][j], DP[cur][j] + L[i] + j);
                    DP[nxt][j + 1] = min(DP[nxt][j + 1], DP[cur][j] + U[i]);
                }
        }
        if (P[pos] != 0) {
            long long add = 1e12;
            for (int i = 0; i < M + 1; i++)
                add = min(add, DP[M % 2][i]);
            ans += add;
        }
        pos = npos;
    }
    cout << ans << endl;
}
```

### Explanation of Inserted Checks

- **Sort Complexity Check:** Before starting the bubble sort, we check if the input size `N` is large enough to potentially result in excessive sorting operations.
- **Grouping Complexity Check:** After determining the size `M` of groups with the same absolute values, we check if this size is large enough to trigger computational inefficiency.
- **DP Update Complexity Check:** Before performing updates on the DP table, ensure that the size `M` does not exceed a threshold that would lead to expensive updates.

These checks serve as guardrails against potential performance bottlenecks, helping identify scenarios that may degrade performance during runtime.
