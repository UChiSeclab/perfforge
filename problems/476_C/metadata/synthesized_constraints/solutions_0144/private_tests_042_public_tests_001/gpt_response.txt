### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

Upon analyzing the provided hit count information, it is evident that the primary performance bottleneck occurs in the loop starting at line 21:

1. **Loop Analysis:**
   - The line `for (long long k = 1; k <= a; k++)` (line 21) is hit 10,000,001 times for the slow input and 3 times for the fast input. This indicates a direct correlation between the value of `a` and the number of loop iterations.
   - Each operation within the loop (lines 22 to 28) reflects a similar scale of hit counts, signifying they are executed for each iteration of the loop.

2. **Inefficient Code Path:**
   - The lines within this loop perform several arithmetic operations, repeated for every value of `k` from 1 to `a`. These operations include multiplications, additions, and modulus operations, all of which, while not individually expensive, cumulatively contribute to the high execution time given the large value of `a`.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the analysis from Phase 1, the following performance-characterizing invariants describe conditions under which the program is likely to slow down:

1. **Iteration Count Invariant:**
   - **Description:** "If the value of `a` is large, particularly when it approaches the upper limit of the constraint (10,000,000), the loop executes many times, causing significant slowdowns due to repeated arithmetic operations."
   - **Rationale:** The slow input with `a = 10,000,000` results in a large number of loop iterations, whereas a smaller `a`, such as 2 for the fast input, results in only a few iterations. The performance degradation is directly tied to the number of iterations driven by `a`.

2. **Arithmetic Operation Invariant:**
   - **Description:** "For each increment in `k`, multiple arithmetic operations are performed, which can become costly when repeated a large number of times due to large values of `a`."
   - **Rationale:** Each iteration of the loop involves several operations (lines 22 to 28), whose cumulative effect becomes significant when iterated 10,000,000 times, as in the slow input.

3. **Exponential Growth Factor Invariant:**
   - **Description:** "When the combination of high values for `a` and a multiplier effect from the arithmetic operations in the loop (especially when `b` is also non-trivially large) occurs, computation time increases dramatically."
   - **Rationale:** The program performs operations based on `b` within the loop, and while the arithmetic isnâ€™t inherently exponential, the repeated calculations can have compounding effects, particularly when `b` is not minimal.

These invariants help to identify scenarios that would trigger slow performance, primarily focusing on the size of `a` and the repetitive nature of the arithmetic operations within the loop. They align with the constraints, acknowledging scenarios where `a` is maximized and `b` contributes to the arithmetic complexity.

### Phase 3: Implementing Performance-Characterizing Invariants in C++

Here are the C++ code snippets implementing the performance-characterizing invariants as runtime checks:

```cpp
void check_iteration_count_invariant(long long a) {
    if (a > 1e6) { // Threshold chosen based on constraints and potential slowdown.
        cerr << "Warning: Iteration count invariant triggered - too many loop iterations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_arithmetic_operation_invariant(long long a, long long b) {
    if (a > 1e6 && b > 1) { // High `a` combined with non-minimal `b` could be problematic.
        cerr << "Warning: Arithmetic operation invariant triggered - potential arithmetic overload!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_exponential_growth_factor_invariant(long long a, long long b) {
    if (a > 1e6 && b > 1e6) { // Both `a` and `b` being large can compound the issue.
        cerr << "Warning: Exponential growth factor invariant triggered - excessive arithmetic operations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrating Checks into the Original Program

Below is the instrumented C++ code with the runtime checks integrated at appropriate points in the program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

long long const mod = 1e9 + 7;

long long power(long long b, long long p) {
    long long r = 1;
    while (p) {
        if (p & 1) r = (r * b) % mod;
        b = (b * b) % mod;
        p >>= 1;
    }
    return r;
}

void check_iteration_count_invariant(long long a) {
    if (a > 1e6) { // Threshold chosen based on constraints and potential slowdown.
        cerr << "Warning: Iteration count invariant triggered - too many loop iterations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_arithmetic_operation_invariant(long long a, long long b) {
    if (a > 1e6 && b > 1) { // High `a` combined with non-minimal `b` could be problematic.
        cerr << "Warning: Arithmetic operation invariant triggered - potential arithmetic overload!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_exponential_growth_factor_invariant(long long a, long long b) {
    if (a > 1e6 && b > 1e6) { // Both `a` and `b` being large can compound the issue.
        cerr << "Warning: Exponential growth factor invariant triggered - excessive arithmetic operations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
    cin.tie(0);
    cout.tie(0);

    long long z = power(2, mod - 2);
    long long a, b;
    cin >> a >> b;

    // Insert checks before the main computation starts
    check_iteration_count_invariant(a);
    check_arithmetic_operation_invariant(a, b);
    check_exponential_growth_factor_invariant(a, b);

    long long ans = 0;
    for (long long k = 1; k <= a; k++) {
        long long x = k * b + 1;
        x %= mod;
        x = (x * b) % mod;
        x = (x * (b - 1)) % mod;
        x = (x + mod) % mod;
        x = (x * z) % mod;
        ans = (ans + x) % mod;
    }
    cout << ans << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

- **Iteration Count Invariant Check:** This is checked right after the input is read. If `a` exceeds a threshold representing a high number of loop iterations (e.g., `1e6`), a warning is triggered.
  
- **Arithmetic Operation Invariant Check:** This is also checked after reading the input to ensure `a` is high enough and `b` is non-trivial, as this combination can lead to potential overload.
  
- **Exponential Growth Factor Invariant Check:** This ensures that both `a` and `b` aren't simultaneously large, which significantly impacts performance. Again, it is checked immediately after input handling to prevent unnecessary computation.

These checks are designed to catch performance bottlenecks and will abort execution if they detect a potential issue. This helps in diagnosing and avoiding scenarios that would lead to significant slowdowns.
