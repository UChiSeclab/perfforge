=== Invariants Response ===
To address this task, we'll break down the problem into two main phases:

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Compare Line-Level Hit Counts:**
   - The line-level hit counts indicate that the loop at line 15 (`for (int rem = 1; rem < b; rem++)`) executes `16246560` times for the slow input, compared to only once for the fast input. This is the primary area of interest.

2. **Pinpoint Significant Lines:**
   - Lines 16 through 26 are executed within this loop, suggesting their computations are repeated `16246559` times for the slow input, and these constitute the main performance bottleneck.

3. **Inference on Interactions:**
   - The loop iterates `b - 1` times. Given the constraints that both `a` and `b` can be very large (up to `10^7`), this suggests that when `b` is close to its upper limit, the number of loop iterations becomes a significant factor in performance degradation.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **Generate Natural Language Statements:**
   - Based on the analysis, our goal is to describe conditions that trigger slow paths in this computation.

2. **Performance-Characterizing Invariants:**

   - **Invariant #1: Large Loop Iterations**
     - **Natural Language Description:** "If the value of `b` is large, nearing its upper constraint (e.g., above `10^6`), the loop can execute close to `b - 1` times, causing performance to degrade significantly due to the high number of iterations."
    
   - **Invariant #2: Computational Overhead in Loop**
     - **Natural Language Description:** "The repeated arithmetic operations involving large numbers within the loop become a bottleneck when the loop runs many times, especially when `b` is significantly large. This can lead to excessive computational overhead."
  
3. **Broadening Conditions:**
   - These invariants emphasize that when `b` is large, the loop's impact on performance becomes substantial. This is not dependent on specific values but rather the pattern of having a large upper bound for `b`.

4. **Utility of the Invariants:**
   - These invariants provide guidance on potential slow scenarios, such as test cases where `b` is near its upper limit, without relying on specific input values. These can be useful for fuzz testing and understanding performance characteristics under varying inputs.

By identifying these invariants, we focus on the overarching conditions that degrade performance, particularly those involving large iteration counts and repetitive calculations. This helps in optimizing or reevaluating the algorithm to handle such scenarios more efficiently.

=== Checker Response ===
Let's proceed with implementing the performance-characterizing invariants as C++ checker functions and then integrate them into the given program.

### Phase 3: Implement the Invariants as Checker Code in C++

Based on the previously derived invariants:

1. **Invariant for Large Loop Iterations:**
   - We identified that if `b` is nearing its upper constraint (e.g., above `10^6`), the loop can execute excessively and degrade performance.

2. **Invariant for Computational Overhead in Loop:**
   - When `b` is large, repeated arithmetic operations within the loop become burdensome.

Let's translate these invariants into runtime checks:

```cpp
void check_large_b_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Large 'b' value triggering excessive loop iterations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_arithmetic_overhead_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Arithmetic overhead triggered by large 'b'!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrate the Checks into the Original Program

Now, we will integrate these checks into the original program to detect performance bottlenecks before the loop executes.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
long long fst, lst, val, ans, a, b;
long long mag;

// Function for modular exponentiation
long long pw(long long a, long long b) {
    if (b == 0) return 1;
    if (b % 2) return a * pw(a, b - 1) % 1000000007;
    return pw(a * a % 1000000007, b / 2);
}

// Function to compute modular inverse
long long inv(long long x) {
    return pw(x, 1000000007 - 2);
}

// Function to check invariant for large b triggering excessive loop iterations
void check_large_b_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Large 'b' value triggering excessive loop iterations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Function to check invariant for arithmetic overhead
void check_arithmetic_overhead_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Arithmetic overhead triggered by large 'b'!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
    cin >> a >> b;

    // Check for large b value
    check_large_b_invariant(b > 1000000);

    // Check for potential arithmetic overhead
    check_arithmetic_overhead_invariant(b > 1000000);

    mag = inv(2);
    for (int rem = 1; rem < b; rem++) {
        fst = rem * b + rem;
        fst %= 1000000007;
        lst = ((rem * a) % 1000000007 * b) % 1000000007 + rem;
        lst %= 1000000007;
        val = fst + lst;
        val *= a;
        val %= 1000000007;
        val *= mag;
        val %= 1000000007;
        ans += val;
        ans %= 1000000007;
    }
    cout << ans << endl;
    cin.get();
    cin.get();
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of Integration

- **Where Checks are Added:**
  - The checks are added right after reading input values and before entering the loop to ensure the conditions are evaluated once, avoiding any overhead in a tight loop.
  
- **Purpose of Each Check:**
  - **`check_large_b_invariant`:** Detects if `b` is large, which could result in a high number of loop iterations.
  - **`check_arithmetic_overhead_invariant`:** Detects potential arithmetic overhead due to large `b` values.

This integration should help detect scenarios where the program is likely to experience performance issues due to large values of `b`.
