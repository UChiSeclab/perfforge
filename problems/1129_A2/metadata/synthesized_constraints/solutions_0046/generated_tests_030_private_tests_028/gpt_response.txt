### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

Based on the hit count information provided for both the slow and fast inputs, we can identify lines of code that are executed significantly more times during the slow run compared to the fast run. The following segments stand out:

1. **Initialization of Arrays `mindist`, `r`, and `vis`:**
   - **Line 15**: This line shows 12210 hits for the slow input vs. only 12 for the fast input. Since this line initializes arrays for each station, it indicates that the cost of initialization scales heavily with the number of stations.

2. **Nested Loop over Stations:**
   - **Lines 16-21**: These lines involve a nested loop iterating over the stations, with line 21 showing a high hit count discrepancy (slow: 12210, fast: 12). This suggests that the inner loop's operations—especially the logic related to `mindist` and `r`—are costly when repeatedly executed for each station.

3. **Distance Calculation and Updates:**
   - **Lines 23-37**: These lines handle calculating the distance and updating `mindist` for each potential candy movement. The significant hits (slow: 110 or more, fast: 3 or less) suggest that this part of the computation intensifies the slowdown because it involves condition checks and min operations for every pair of station and candy.

4. **Loop for Calculating Minimum Delivery Time:**
   - **Lines 42-52**: Again, this block is repeatedly hit (slow: 12210, fast: 12), which indicates that calculating the delivery time for each station is computationally intensive, especially for larger `n`.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the expensive operations identified, the following performance-characterizing invariants can be proposed:

1. **High Station and Candy Count Interaction:**
   - **Invariant**: "When the number of stations `n` is large and there are multiple candies with starting positions that require traversal of most stations, the initialization and distance calculations for each station contribute significantly to the runtime."

2. **Frequent Reset and Calculation:**
   - **Invariant**: "If the arrays used for tracking visitations and minimum distances (`vis`, `mindist`) are reset and recalculated for all stations frequently, especially when `n` approaches its upper limit, the performance degrades due to repeated operations."

3. **Circular Network Traversal:**
   - **Invariant**: "For large input sizes, when candies are positioned such that their destinations require traversing the entire or significant portions of the circular network multiple times, the number of iterations over the station array increases disproportionately, slowing down the computation."

4. **Resource-intensive Nested Loops:**
   - **Invariant**: "The nested loop structure, especially involving conditions related to `mindist` and `res`, results in significant overhead when `n` is high, and the pattern of candy destinations requires extensive checks and updates."

These invariants identify broad conditions that are likely to trigger performance bottlenecks, regardless of specific numeric details of the input, and are designed to help identify potential future slow scenarios within the input constraints.

### Phase 3: Implementing the Invariants as Checker Code in C++

Based on the performance-characterizing invariants identified in natural language, we will implement runtime checks to detect conditions that may lead to performance bottlenecks.

#### Invariant 1: High Station and Candy Count Interaction

```cpp
void check_station_candy_count(int n, int m) {
    if (n > 4000 && m > 15000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered! High station and candy counts." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

#### Invariant 2: Frequent Reset and Calculation

```cpp
void check_frequent_reset(int n) {
    if (n > 4000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered! Frequent reset and calculation for large n." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

#### Invariant 3: Circular Network Traversal

```cpp
void check_circular_traversal(int n, const vector<int>& v) {
    int highTraversalStations = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        if (v[i].size() > n / 2) {
            highTraversalStations++;
        }
    }
    if (highTraversalStations > n / 4) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered! High traversal in circular network." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

#### Invariant 4: Resource-intensive Nested Loops

```cpp
void check_nested_loops(int n, const vector<int>& r) {
    int heavyProcessingStations = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        if (r[i] > n / 4) {
            heavyProcessingStations++;
        }
    }
    if (heavyProcessingStations > n / 4) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered! Resource-intensive nested loops." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrating the Checker Code into the Original Program

Now, we'll integrate these checks into the original C++ program to help identify scenarios that may lead to poor performance.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int n, m;
pair<int, int> A[20005];
vector<int> v[5005];
int atleast[5005], r[5005], vis[5005], mindist[5005];

// Checker functions for performance invariants
void check_station_candy_count(int n, int m) {
    if (n > 4000 && m > 15000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered! High station and candy counts." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_frequent_reset(int n) {
    if (n > 4000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered! Frequent reset and calculation for large n." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_circular_traversal(int n, const vector<int>& v) {
    int highTraversalStations = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        if (v[i].size() > n / 2) {
            highTraversalStations++;
        }
    }
    if (highTraversalStations > n / 4) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered! High traversal in circular network." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_nested_loops(int n, const vector<int>& r) {
    int heavyProcessingStations = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        if (r[i] > n / 4) {
            heavyProcessingStations++;
        }
    }
    if (heavyProcessingStations > n / 4) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered! Resource-intensive nested loops." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    scanf("%d %d", &n, &m);
    
    // Check for potential performance bottlenecks based on initial input
    check_station_candy_count(n, m);

    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        int x, y;
        scanf("%d %d", &x, &y);
        v[x].push_back(y);
    }

    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        for (int j = 1; j <= n; j++) mindist[j] = r[j] = vis[j] = 0;

        // Check for frequent resets
        check_frequent_reset(n);

        for (int cur = 1; cur <= n; cur++) {
            int j = i + cur - 1;
            if (j > n) j -= n;
            vis[j] = 1;
            r[j] = v[j].size();
            for (int k : v[j]) {
                int dist;
                if (vis[k] == 0) {
                    if (k > j)
                        dist = k - j;
                    else
                        dist = k + n - j;
                } else {
                    if (k > j)
                        dist = k - j;
                    else
                        dist = k + n - j;
                }
                if (mindist[j] == 0)
                    mindist[j] = dist;
                else
                    mindist[j] = min(mindist[j], dist);
            }
        }

        // Check for circular network traversal
        check_circular_traversal(n, r);

        long long res = 0;
        int t = 0;
        for (int cur = 1; cur <= n; cur++) {
            int j = i + cur - 1;
            if (j > n) j -= n;
            long long tmp = r[j];
            if (tmp == 0) {
                t++;
                continue;
            }
            tmp = 1ll * (tmp - 1) * n + t + mindist[j];
            res = max(res, tmp);
            t++;
        }

        // Check for resource-intensive loops
        check_nested_loops(n, r);

        printf("%lld ", res);
    }
    puts("");
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

- **Checker Functions**: Each function checks a particular invariant and issues a warning if a bottleneck condition is detected.
- **Integration**: We strategically place these checks at various points in the main function: 
  - **`check_station_candy_count`** is called after reading the inputs to catch potentially problematic input sizes early on.
  - **`check_frequent_reset`** is called before the nested loops to avoid repeated resets being a bottleneck.
  - **`check_circular_traversal`** and **`check_nested_loops`** are called after the nested loop structures to ensure traversal and processing do not become excessive.
