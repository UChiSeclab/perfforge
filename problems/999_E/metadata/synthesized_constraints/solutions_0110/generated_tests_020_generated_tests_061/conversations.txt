system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

There are n cities and m roads in Berland. Each road connects a pair of cities. The roads in Berland are one-way.

What is the minimum number of new roads that need to be built to make all the cities reachable from the capital?

New roads will also be one-way.

Input

The first line of input consists of three integers n, m and s (1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, 0 ≤ m ≤ 5000, 1 ≤ s ≤ n) — the number of cities, the number of roads and the index of the capital. Cities are indexed from 1 to n.

The following m lines contain roads: road i is given as a pair of cities u_i, v_i (1 ≤ u_i, v_i ≤ n, u_i ≠ v_i). For each pair of cities (u, v), there can be at most one road from u to v. Roads in opposite directions between a pair of cities are allowed (i.e. from u to v and from v to u).

Output

Print one integer — the minimum number of extra roads needed to make all the cities reachable from city s. If all the cities are already reachable from s, print 0.

assistant: To analyze the performance bottleneck in the given C program, we will follow a two-phase approach:

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Comparing Line-Level Hit Counts:**
   - The function `dfs2` is the primary source of the significant difference in hit counts between the fast and slow inputs:
     - **Line 10 (`dfs2` function call):** 5,438,224 hits (slow) vs. 1 hit (fast).
     - **Lines 11, 12, 13, 15:** Similar high hit counts in the slow run.
   - The loop starting at line 43 and ending at line 48 also contributes to the high hit counts, repeating for each unvisited city.

2. **Understanding the Code Structure:**
   - The function `dfs2` is called repeatedly within a nested loop structure.
   - The loop traverses `unin`, a list of initially unreachable cities, with a wrap-around indexing due to `i % kk`.
   - For each unvisited city in `unin`, `dfs2` is executed, marking it and trying to reach further nodes.

3. **Input Dependency:**
   - The slow input has `n = 2333` and `m = 1`, resulting in a scenario where most cities are initially unreachable, leading to a large `unin`.
   - The fast input with `n = 2` and `m = 1` has almost no unreachable cities.

### Phase 2: Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Here are the natural language invariants that characterize performance issues in this code:

1. **High Number of Initially Unreachable Cities:**
   - **Invariant:** "If a large number of cities are initially unreachable from the capital, the program performs extensive redundant operations trying to make them reachable, leading to a performance slowdown."
   - **Explanation:** When the number of initially unreachable cities (`unin.size()`) is large, it causes the nested loop and `dfs2` calls to repeat excessively, increasing computational overhead.

2. **Nested Loop Over Unreachable Cities:**
   - **Invariant:** "When the list of unreachable cities is long and processed through a nested loop with wrap-around indexing, each city is revisited multiple times, which can degrade performance significantly."
   - **Explanation:** The wrap-around strategy in indexing (`i % kk`) causes repeated attempts to process cities that may already be reachable, unnecessarily increasing the execution time.

3. **Sparse Road Network Effect:**
   - **Invariant:** "In cases where there are very few roads compared to the number of cities, the program's attempts to connect all cities can become inefficient, especially when iteratively checking cities that are difficult to reach."
   - **Explanation:** A sparse road network (low `m` relative to `n`) increases the likelihood of large unreachable sections that need repetitive processing to establish connectivity.

These invariants guide the understanding of when and why the program might slow down, helping diagnose and optimize for different input scenarios within the problem's constraints (e.g., `n <= 5000`).

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
There are n cities and m roads in Berland. Each road connects a pair of cities. The roads in Berland are one-way.

What is the minimum number of new roads that need to be built to make all the cities reachable from the capital?

New roads will also be one-way.

Input

The first line of input consists of three integers n, m and s (1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, 0 ≤ m ≤ 5000, 1 ≤ s ≤ n) — the number of cities, the number of roads and the index of the capital. Cities are indexed from 1 to n.

The following m lines contain roads: road i is given as a pair of cities u_i, v_i (1 ≤ u_i, v_i ≤ n, u_i ≠ v_i). For each pair of cities (u, v), there can be at most one road from u to v. Roads in opposite directions between a pair of cities are allowed (i.e. from u to v and from v to u).

Output

Print one integer — the minimum number of extra roads needed to make all the cities reachable from city s. If all the cities are already reachable from s, print 0.

For example, you can add roads (6, 4), (7, 9), (1, 7) to make all the cities reachable from s = 1.

The second example is illustrated by the following:

<image>

In this example, you can add any one of the roads (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4) to make all the cities reachable from s = 5.

assistant: ### Phase 3: Implementing the Invariants as Checker Code in C++

Let's translate the derived performance-characterizing invariants into C++ checker code.

1. **High Number of Initially Unreachable Cities:**
   ```cpp
   // Check if the number of initially unreachable cities is large
   void check_unreachable_cities_invariant(const vector<int>& unin) {
       if (unin.size() > 1000) { // Threshold based on performance observation
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck triggered - too many initially unreachable cities!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Nested Loop Over Unreachable Cities:**
   ```cpp
   // Check if the program is repeatedly processing a large number of cities in a wrap-around loop
   void check_nested_loop_invariant(int kk) {
       if (kk > 1000) { // Threshold considering the slow inputs
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck triggered - excessive processing in nested loop!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Sparse Road Network Effect:**
   ```cpp
   // Check if the road network is too sparse compared to the number of cities
   void check_sparse_network_invariant(int n, int m) {
       if (m < n / 10) { // Arbitrary threshold indicating sparseness
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck triggered - sparse road network!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Integrating Checker Code into the Original Program

Now, let's integrate these checkers into the C++ program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
long long MOD = 1000 * 1000 * 1000 + 7;

void dfs(int ind, vector<vector<int> > &g, vector<int> &used) {
    used[ind] = 1;
    for (auto i : g[ind]) {
        if (!used[i]) dfs(i, g, used);
    }
}

void dfs2(int ind, vector<vector<int> > &g, vector<int> &used, int t) {
    used[ind] = t;
    for (auto i : g[ind]) {
        if (!used[i]) dfs2(i, g, used, t);
    }
}

// Performance checkers
void check_unreachable_cities_invariant(const vector<int>& unin) {
    if (unin.size() > 1000) { // Threshold based on performance observation
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck triggered - too many initially unreachable cities!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_nested_loop_invariant(int kk) {
    if (kk > 1000) { // Threshold considering the slow inputs
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck triggered - excessive processing in nested loop!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_sparse_network_invariant(int n, int m) {
    if (m < n / 10) { // Arbitrary threshold indicating sparseness
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck triggered - sparse road network!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    int n, m, s;
    scanf("%d %d %d", &n, &m, &s);
    s--;
    
    vector<vector<int> > g(n);
    vector<int> p(n, 0);
    vector<int> used(n, 0);
    
    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        int a, b;
        scanf("%d %d", &a, &b);
        g[--a].push_back(--b);
        p[b]++;
    }
    
    // Check for sparse network invariant
    check_sparse_network_invariant(n, m);
    
    dfs(s, g, used);
    
    vector<int> unin;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (!used[i]) unin.push_back(i);
    }
    
    // Check for unreachable cities invariant
    check_unreachable_cities_invariant(unin);
    
    sort(unin.begin(), unin.end(), [&](int l, int r) {
        if (p[l] == p[r]) return g[l].size() > g[r].size();
        return (int)p[l] < (int)p[r];
    });
    
    int ans = INT_MAX;
    int start = 0;
    int kk = (int)unin.size();
    
    // Check for nested loop invariant
    check_nested_loop_invariant(kk);
    
    while (start < kk) {
        int type = 1;
        for (int i = start; i < start + kk; i++) {
            if (!used[unin[i % kk]]) {
                dfs2(unin[i % kk], g, used, type);
                type++;
            }
        }
        ans = min(ans, type);
        for (auto i : unin) used[i] = 0;
        start++;
    }
    
    if (ans == INT_MAX) ans = 1;
    printf("%d\n", ans - 1);
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of Integration:

- **check_unreachable_cities_invariant**: Added after `unin` is populated, to detect if the initial unreachability set is large.
  
- **check_sparse_network_invariant**: Added after reading input, to determine if the road network is too sparse compared to the number of cities.

- **check_nested_loop_invariant**: Added before entering the nested loop structure, to avoid excessive processing due to a large number of initial unreachable cities being iterated over.

These checks are strategically placed to maximize detection of performance bottlenecks without increasing overhead in critical computation loops.
