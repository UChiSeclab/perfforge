### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

Based on the hit count data provided, let's analyze the critical differences between the slow and fast runs:

1. **Line 14 and 15 in `Combination2` Constructor:**
   - **Hit Counts:**
     - Slow: 214,661
     - Fast: 181,252
   - This loop is executed for the factorial computation, which is likely expensive for large `n`.

2. **`pow_mod` Function (Lines 20-24):**
   - **Hit Counts:**
     - Slow: Multiple millions
     - Fast: Fewer millions
   - This function is called multiple times during the factorial and combination calculations, contributing to the expensive computations.

3. **Lines 48-59 in the `solve` function:**
   - **Hit Counts:**
     - Slow: 214,651 times for the loop versus 181,242 times in the fast input.
   - The loop runs to calculate `add` for maintaining the sum condition, indicating potentially more iterations or complex calculations in the slow case.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

From the analysis, we can infer the conditions where the code might slow down:

1. **Factorial Computation and Combinations:**
   - Natural Language Description: "When the input size `n` is large, particularly close to its upper limit of 200,000, the computation of factorials and combinations becomes expensive. This is exacerbated by repeated calls to compute combinations, especially when many are close in value to n/2."
   - **Trigger:** High values of `n`, requiring extensive factorial calculations.

2. **Repeated Modular Exponentiation:**
   - Natural Language Description: "If the computation involves frequent modular exponentiation, particularly with large exponents, the operations become costly. This is a major factor when computing large combinations or factorial inversions."
   - **Trigger:** Large factorial or combination calculations due to high `n`, especially when precision inversions are required.

3. **Loop Execution in `solve`:**
   - Natural Language Description: "The main loop in `solve` runs significantly longer when the boundary values `l` and `r` are far apart, particularly when the range size causes `k` to iterate many times. This results in prolonged computation of additional combinations."
   - **Trigger:** Wide range between `l` and `r` leading to a large number of iterations in the while loop.

### Concise Statements about Performance Triggers

1. If `n` is close to its maximum value and factorials are computed, the program may slow significantly due to the heavy computation required for large factorials and combinations.
2. When the function `pow_mod` is repeatedly called with large exponents, arising from frequent combination calculations, the performance might degrade substantially.
3. For a test case where the range `r - l` is large, the loop inside `solve` may iterate many times, leading to significant performance degradation.

These invariants are broad enough to detect potential slowdowns in future test cases and can assist in optimizing or analyzing the code further.

### Phase 3: Implementing Invariants as C++ Code

Let's translate the previously derived natural language invariants into C++ checker code.

#### Invariant 1: Large `n` leading to expensive factorial and combination computations
```cpp
void check_factorial_invariant(int n) {
    if (n > 180000) {  // A threshold close to the upper limit
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to large factorial computations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

#### Invariant 2: Repeated modular exponentiation
```cpp
void check_modular_exponentiation_invariant(int exponent) {
    if (exponent > 1000000) {  // Arbitrary large value for the exponent
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to repeated large modular exponentiations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

#### Invariant 3: Wide range `r - l` causing prolonged loop execution
```cpp
void check_range_invariant(long long l, long long r) {
    if ((r - l) > 500000) {  // Wide range indicating potential slowdown
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to wide range between l and r!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrating Checker Code into the Original Program

Now, let's incorporate these checks into the original C++ code at appropriate locations to ensure they do not add significant overhead within tight loops.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>

using namespace std;
using ll = long long;

class Combination2 {
    using T = unsigned long long;
    T MOD;
    vector<T> fact;
public :
    Combination2(int n, T MOD = 0)
    : MOD(MOD), fact(n+1) {
        fact[0] = 1;
        for(auto i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
            fact[i] = fact[i-1] * i % MOD;
        }
    }

    T pow_mod(long long x, long long y, long long mod) {
        auto ret=1ll;
        while (y) {
            if (y % 2)
                ret = ret * x % mod;
            x =  x * x % mod;
            y /= 2;
        }
        return ret;
    }

    T nCr(int n, int r) {
        if (n < 0 || r > n || r < 0) return 0;
        return fact[n] * pow_mod(fact[n-r], MOD - 2, MOD) % MOD * pow_mod(fact[r], MOD - 2, MOD) % MOD;
    }
};

constexpr int MOD = 1e9 + 7;

// Checking invariants
void check_factorial_invariant(int n) {
    if (n > 180000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to large factorial computations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_modular_exponentiation_invariant(int exponent) {
    if (exponent > 1000000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to repeated large modular exponentiations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_range_invariant(long long l, long long r) {
    if ((r - l) > 500000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to wide range between l and r!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void solve(int TestCase) {
    ll n, l, r;
    cin >> n >> l >> r;

    // Check invariants before heavy computation
    check_factorial_invariant(n);
    check_range_invariant(l, r);

    Combination2 C(n, MOD);

    auto k = min(abs(l - 1), abs(r - n));
    ll ret = k * C.nCr(n, n / 2) % MOD;
    if(n % 2)
        ret = ret * 2 % MOD;

    while(true) {
        ++k;
        auto plus = max(1ll, l + k);
        auto minus = min(n, r - k);
        
        ll add = C.nCr(minus - plus + 1, n / 2 - (plus - 1));
        if(n % 2)
            add += C.nCr(minus - plus + 1, (n + 1) / 2 - (plus - 1));

        if(minus - plus + 1 < 0) break;

        ret = (ret + add) % MOD;
    }

    cout << ret << endl;
}

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);
    cout.tie(NULL);

    int t = 1;
    cin >> t;
    for(auto i = 1; i <= t; ++i) {
        solve(i);
    }
}
```

**Comments:**
- **Factorial Invariant Check:** Added right after reading `n`, since this value is critical for checking factorial computation cost.
- **Modular Exponentiation Check:** Could be placed in `pow_mod` if needed to check repeatedly large exponents.
- **Range Check Invariant:** Added right after reading `l` and `r`, to avoid unnecessary loop executions if the range is too wide.
