system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

Let's call an integer array a_1, a_2, ..., a_n good if a_i ≠ i for each i.

Let F(a) be the number of pairs (i, j) (1 ≤ i < j ≤ n) such that a_i + a_j = i + j.

Let's say that an array a_1, a_2, ..., a_n is excellent if: 

  * a is good; 
  * l ≤ a_i ≤ r for each i; 
  * F(a) is the maximum possible among all good arrays of size n. 



Given n, l and r, calculate the number of excellent arrays modulo 10^9 + 7.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) — the number of test cases. 

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n, l, and r (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; -10^9 ≤ l ≤ 1; n ≤ r ≤ 10^9).

It's guaranteed that the sum of n doesn't exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.

Output

For each test case, print the number of excellent arrays modulo 10^9 + 7.

Example

3 0 3

42 -33 55
69 -42 146


Output

10
143922563
698570404

Note

In the first test case, it can be proven that the maximum F(a) among all good arrays a is equal to 2. The excellent arrays are: 

  1. [2, 1, 2]; 
  2. [0, 3, 2]; 
  3. [2, 3, 2]; 
  4. [3, 0, 1].

					ans = (ans + 1) % mod;
			}

			mn++;
		}

		printf("%lld\n", ans);
	}

	return 0;

assistant: To analyze the performance bottlenecks present in the provided C code, let's follow the outlined steps to identify expensive or inefficient code segments and derive performance-characterizing invariants.

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Compare Line-Level Hit Counts:**
   - The `ipow` function is frequently hit much more during the slow run compared to the fast run, with notable differences in lines 10, 14, 15, 16, 17, and 19.
   - The `comb` function (line 24 to 25) is called significantly more during the slow input.
   - The nested while loops starting at line 45 and involving loops at line 49 and line 51 show higher hit counts for the slow input.

2. **Pinpoint Inefficient Lines:**
   - The function `ipow` is a recursive function that calculates powers with modular arithmetic. Its recursive nature can become costly if frequently called with large exponents.
   - The loop constructs, particularly those iterating over indices based on the conditions in lines 46, 49, 51, and their subsequent actions lines 50, 52, etc., are executed many more times in the slow input.

3. **Data Structure and Loop Interaction:**
   - The recursion in `ipow` and the nested while loops significantly influence the running time. The `while` loops, especially lines 45-74, appear to be costly when iterating over larger ranges, which happens more in the slow input.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the analysis above, here are some performance invariants that explain under what conditions the code slows down:

1. **Recursive Power Calculation:**
   - **Natural Language Invariant:** "When `n` is large, and especially when `r` or `l` are at extreme values, the recursive power calculations become the bottleneck due to high recursion depth and frequent computations."
   - **Characteristic:** This invariant is triggered by large values of `n` and extreme differences in `l` and `r`, causing many recursive power calculations with `ipow`.

2. **Loop Execution Over Wide Ranges:**
   - **Natural Language Invariant:** "If the difference between the range boundaries (`r - l` and `r - n`) is substantial, the nested loop constructs will iterate extensively, causing increased computation time."
   - **Characteristic:** This is triggered when the loops (lines 49 and 51) iterate over wide ranges, with conditions that are slowly changing due to the values of `l` and `r`.

3. **Combinatorial Calculations:**
   - **Natural Language Invariant:** "In scenarios where combinatorial calculations are repeatedly computed on broad data ranges, it can lead to a slowdown. This is often the case when `comb` is computed multiple times due to adjusting `s` and `e` indices."
   - **Characteristic:** This is identified when `e - s + 1` and resulting combinations are frequently recalculated, particularly noted on line 63, which has higher counts in the slow scenario.

### Summary

These invariants illustrate the potential slowdowns related to recursive depth in power calculations and extensive loop iterations driven by specific combinations of `n`, `l`, and `r`. These conditions are critical in understanding when and why the program experiences significant performance degradation.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
Let's call an integer array a_1, a_2, ..., a_n good if a_i ≠ i for each i.

Let F(a) be the number of pairs (i, j) (1 ≤ i < j ≤ n) such that a_i + a_j = i + j.

Let's say that an array a_1, a_2, ..., a_n is excellent if: 

  * a is good; 
  * l ≤ a_i ≤ r for each i; 
  * F(a) is the maximum possible among all good arrays of size n. 



Given n, l and r, calculate the number of excellent arrays modulo 10^9 + 7.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) — the number of test cases. 

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n, l, and r (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; -10^9 ≤ l ≤ 1; n ≤ r ≤ 10^9).

It's guaranteed that the sum of n doesn't exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.

Output

For each test case, print the number of excellent arrays modulo 10^9 + 7.

Example

Input


4
3 0 3
4 -3 5
42 -33 55
69 -42 146


Output


4
10
143922563
698570404

Note

In the first test case, it can be proven that the maximum F(a) among all good arrays a is equal to 2. The excellent arrays are: 

  1. [2, 1, 2]; 
  2. [0, 3, 2]; 
  3. [2, 3, 2]; 
  4. [3, 0, 1].

assistant: ### Phase 3: Implement the Natural Language Invariants in C++

Below are the C++ code snippets that implement runtime checks for the performance-characterizing invariants derived from the analysis.

1. **Recursive Power Calculation:**
   ```cpp
   // Check if ipow might be called excessively for large exponents
   void check_recursive_power_invariant(ll n, ll l, ll r) {
       if (n > 100000 || abs(l - r) > 1000000) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive recursive power calculations!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Loop Execution Over Wide Ranges:**
   ```cpp
   // Check for potentially excessive loop iterations
   void check_loop_range_invariant(ll mn) {
       if (mn > 100000) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive loop range iterations!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Combinatorial Calculations:**
   ```cpp
   // Check for excessive combinatorial calculations
   void check_combinatorial_invariant(ll s, ll e, ll n) {
       if ((e - s + 1) > 10000) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive combinatorial calculations!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Integrate the Checkers with the Original Program

Here’s how you integrate these checkers into the original C++ program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>

using namespace std;

typedef long long ll;
typedef pair<int, int> pi;

const ll mod = 1e9 + 7;

ll ipow(ll a, ll p) {
    if (p == 0)
        return 1;
    ll ret = ipow(a, p / 2);
    ret = ret * ret % mod;
    if (p & 1)
        ret = ret * a % mod;
    return ret;
}

ll fac[200005];

ll comb(ll n, ll r) {
    return fac[n] * ipow(fac[r], mod - 2) % mod * ipow(fac[n - r], mod - 2) % mod;
}

// Check if ipow might be called excessively for large exponents
void check_recursive_power_invariant(ll n, ll l, ll r) {
    if (n > 100000 || abs(l - r) > 1000000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive recursive power calculations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Check for potentially excessive loop iterations
void check_loop_range_invariant(ll mn) {
    if (mn > 100000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive loop range iterations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Check for excessive combinatorial calculations
void check_combinatorial_invariant(ll s, ll e, ll n) {
    if ((e - s + 1) > 10000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive combinatorial calculations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    fac[0] = 1;
    for (int i = 1; i < 200005; ++i)
        fac[i] = fac[i - 1] * i % mod;

    int T;
    scanf("%d", &T);
    while (T--) {
        ll n, l, r;
        scanf("%lld %lld %lld", &n, &l, &r);

        // Apply the check for the excessive recursive power calculations
        check_recursive_power_invariant(n, l, r);

        ll mn = min(-l + 1, r - n);
        
        // Apply the check for excessive loop range iterations
        check_loop_range_invariant(mn);

        ll ans = mn % mod * comb(n, n / 2) * (n % 2 + 1) % mod;

        mn++;
        int s = 1, e = n;
        while (true) {
            if (r - 1 < mn || l - n > -mn)
                break;

            while (l - s > -mn)
                s++;
            while (r - e < mn)
                e--;

            int x = n - e, y = s - 1;

            if (x > (n + 1) / 2 || y > (n + 1) / 2)
                break;

            // Apply the combinatorial invariant check
            check_combinatorial_invariant(s, e, n);

            if (n % 2 == 0) {
                if (e - s + 1 <= 0)
                    ans = (ans + 1) % mod;
                else
                    ans = (ans + comb(e - s + 1, n / 2 - x)) % mod;
            } else {
                if (e - s + 1 > 0 && x < (n + 1) / 2 && y < (n + 1) / 2) {
                    ans = (ans + comb(e - s + 1, n / 2 - x + 1)) % mod;
                    ans = (ans + comb(e - s + 1, n / 2 - x)) % mod;
                } else if (x < (n + 1) / 2 || y < (n + 1) / 2)
                    ans = (ans + 1) % mod;
            }

            mn++;
        }

        printf("%lld\n", ans);
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

- **Recursive Power Check:** Placed after reading inputs to ensure that large inputs or extreme value differences are checked before entering heavy computation.
- **Loop Range Check:** Done before entering potentially large loops, detecting if `mn` could lead to excessive iterations.
- **Combinatorial Check:** Ensures that the range between `s` and `e` does not lead to too many combinatorial calculations, possibly placed before each combinatorial calculation in the loop. 

These additions help identify when the code might fall into known performance bottlenecks.
