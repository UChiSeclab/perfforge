system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

After battling Shikamaru, Tayuya decided that her flute is too predictable, and replaced it with a guitar. The guitar has 6 strings and an infinite number of frets numbered from 1. Fretting the fret number j on the i-th string produces the note a_{i} + j.

Tayuya wants to play a melody of n notes. Each note can be played on different string-fret combination. The easiness of performance depends on the difference between the maximal and the minimal indices of used frets. The less this difference is, the easier it is to perform the technique. Please determine the minimal possible difference.

For example, if a = [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3], and the sequence of notes is 4, 11, 11, 12, 12, 13, 13 (corresponding to the second example), we can play the first note on the first string, and all the other notes on the sixth string. Then the maximal fret will be 10, the minimal one will be 3, and the answer is 10 - 3 = 7, as shown on the picture.

<image>

Input

The first line contains 6 space-separated numbers a_{1}, a_{2}, ..., a_{6} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^{9}) which describe the Tayuya's strings.

The second line contains the only integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000) standing for the number of notes in the melody.

The third line consists of n integers b_{1}, b_{2}, ..., b_{n} (1 ≤ b_{i} ≤ 10^{9}), separated by space. They describe the notes to be played. It's guaranteed that b_i > a_j for all 1≤ i≤ n and 1≤ j≤ 6, in other words, you can play each note on any string.

Output

Print the minimal possible difference of the maximal and the minimal indices of used frets.

Note

In the first sample test it is optimal to play the first note on the first string, the second note on the second string, the third note on the sixth string, the fourth note on the fourth string, the fifth note on the fifth string, and the sixth note on the third string. In this case the 100-th fret is used each time, so the difference is 100 - 100 = 0.

<image>

In the second test it's optimal, for example, to play the second note on the first string, and all the other notes on the sixth string. Then the maximal fret will be 10, the minimal one will be 3, and the answer is 10 - 3 = 7.

assistant: To address the problem, we need to analyze the given C code and determine the potential bottlenecks that lead to performance degradation for specific inputs. Let’s proceed through each phase systematically.

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Comparative Hit Counts**:
   - The function `check1` is called significantly more times for the slow input than for the fast input, as evidenced by line-level hit counts.
   - Particularly, the `for` loop (line 9) and the `if` condition (line 10), along with the `upper_bound` operation (line 13), are heavily utilized in the slow input.
   - The `check` function's nested loops (lines 18 and 19) also indicate high iteration counts, contributing to the slowdown.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The code utilizes a binary search approach to find the minimal difference of maximal and minimal fret indices. However, the nested loops in `check` and `check1` imply a potential quadratic complexity in processing different combinations of note and string-fret pairings.
   - The `upper_bound` function within a loop suggests that for each potential fret range, there is an expensive search operation over the notes, exacerbated by the input size.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the analysis of hit counts and code structure, we can articulate the following performance-characterizing invariants:

1. **Invariant 1: High Loop Iterations with `upper_bound` Search**:
   - **Natural Language Statement**: "Performance degrades when the range of possible fret indices leads to excessive invocation of `upper_bound` in nested loops. This is likely when there are many note candidates for each string over a range of frets."
   - **Reasoning**: The binary search (`upper_bound`) within loops over all notes and strings can lead to quadratic behavior in practice, especially when the fret range is large and notes are numerous.

2. **Invariant 2: Large Number of Notes (`n`) with Uniform Distribution**:
   - **Natural Language Statement**: "The algorithm becomes inefficient when the number of notes `n` is large, especially when these notes are closely packed or uniformly distributed across potential fret values."
   - **Reasoning**: A uniform distribution of notes results in many comparable fret calculations, intensifying the use of nested loop checks and `upper_bound` searches, which can lead to repetitive and costly operations.

3. **Invariant 3: High Variability in String Base Values (`a[i]`)**:
   - **Natural Language Statement**: "Significant variability in string base values `a[i]` can trigger over-exploration of fret combinations, slowing down the computation."
   - **Reasoning**: Diverse string base values increase the possibilities for fret differences, which in turn expand the search space for valid note placements across strings. This amplifies the complexity of determining optimal fret indices.

### Conclusion

The slow performance stems from how fret indices are computed and validated against a large number of notes distributed across strings with varying base values. To mitigate this, a focus on optimizing the range checks and reducing redundant operations in nested loops should be emphasized. Additionally, these invariants highlight the importance of understanding input distribution and potential computational paths that could lead to inefficiency.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
After battling Shikamaru, Tayuya decided that her flute is too predictable, and replaced it with a guitar. The guitar has 6 strings and an infinite number of frets numbered from 1. Fretting the fret number j on the i-th string produces the note a_{i} + j.

Tayuya wants to play a melody of n notes. Each note can be played on different string-fret combination. The easiness of performance depends on the difference between the maximal and the minimal indices of used frets. The less this difference is, the easier it is to perform the technique. Please determine the minimal possible difference.

For example, if a = [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3], and the sequence of notes is 4, 11, 11, 12, 12, 13, 13 (corresponding to the second example), we can play the first note on the first string, and all the other notes on the sixth string. Then the maximal fret will be 10, the minimal one will be 3, and the answer is 10 - 3 = 7, as shown on the picture.

Input

The first line contains 6 space-separated numbers a_{1}, a_{2}, ..., a_{6} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^{9}) which describe the Tayuya's strings.

The second line contains the only integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000) standing for the number of notes in the melody.

The third line consists of n integers b_{1}, b_{2}, ..., b_{n} (1 ≤ b_{i} ≤ 10^{9}), separated by space. They describe the notes to be played. It's guaranteed that b_i > a_j for all 1≤ i≤ n and 1≤ j≤ 6, in other words, you can play each note on any string.

Output

Print the minimal possible difference of the maximal and the minimal indices of used frets.

Examples

Input

Input


1 1 2 2 3 3
7
13 4 11 12 11 13 12


Output


7

Note

In the first sample test it is optimal to play the first note on the first string, the second note on the second string, the third note on the sixth string, the fourth note on the fourth string, the fifth note on the fifth string, and the sixth note on the third string. In this case the 100-th fret is used each time, so the difference is 100 - 100 = 0.

<image>

In the second test it's optimal, for example, to play the second note on the first string, and all the other notes on the sixth string. Then the maximal fret will be 10, the minimal one will be 3, and the answer is 10 - 3 = 7.

Solution (C++ code):
{solution}


assistant: Let's implement the performance-characterizing invariants derived earlier into runtime checks in C++. We'll first implement the checks as standalone functions (Phase 3) and then integrate them into the existing solution (Phase 4) to monitor potential performance bottlenecks.

### Phase 3: Implementing the Invariants in C++

#### Invariant 1: High Loop Iterations with `upper_bound` Search
```cpp
void check_upper_bound_use(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive use of upper_bound in nested loops!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

#### Invariant 2: Large Number of Notes (`n`) with Uniform Distribution
```cpp
void check_large_uniform_distribution(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large number of notes with potential uniform distribution!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

#### Invariant 3: High Variability in String Base Values (`a[i]`)
```cpp
void check_high_variability(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high variability in string base values!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrating the Checks into the Solution

Now, let's integrate these checks at strategic points in the given C++ solution.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
const int max_n = 1e5 + 10, inf = 1000111222;
int n, m;
int a[max_n];
int b[max_n];

void check_upper_bound_use(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive use of upper_bound in nested loops!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_large_uniform_distribution(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large number of notes with potential uniform distribution!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_high_variability(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high variability in string base values!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

bool check1(int l, int r) {
    int p = 0;
    for (int i = 0; p < m && i < n; i++) {
        if (b[p] < a[i] + l) {
            return 0;
        }
        p = upper_bound(b + p, b + m, a[i] + r) - b;
    }
    return p == m;
}

bool check(int x) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
            {
                int l = b[j] - a[i];
                int r = l + x;
                if (check1(l, r)) {
                    return 1;
                }
            }
            {
                int r = b[j] - a[i];
                int l = r - x;
                if (check1(l, r)) {
                    return 1;
                }
            }
        }
    }
    return 0;
}

int main() {
    n = 6;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        cin >> a[i];
    }
    sort(a, a + n);

    // Check for high variability in string base values
    int max_base_value = *max_element(a, a + n);
    int min_base_value = *min_element(a, a + n);
    check_high_variability(max_base_value - min_base_value > 100000); // Arbitrary threshold

    cin >> m;
    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        cin >> b[i];
    }
    sort(b, b + m);

    // Check for large uniform distribution
    check_large_uniform_distribution(m > 50000); // Arbitrary threshold for large m

    int l = 0, r = 1e9;
    while (r - l > 0) {
        int m = (l + r) / 2;

        // Check for excessive use of upper_bound
        check_upper_bound_use(n * m > 1000000); // Arbitrary threshold for nested loops

        if (check(m)) {
            r = m;
        } else {
            l = m + 1;
        }
    }
    cout << l << "\n";
}
```

### Explanation of Insertion Points:

1. **`check_high_variability`:** After sorting the base values of strings, we check for high variability. This is done before processing the notes to avoid performing complex calculations for a widely varying string base set.
   
2. **`check_large_uniform_distribution`:** After sorting the notes, we check if the number of notes (`m`) is beyond a reasonable threshold indicating a potential uniform distribution that might trigger performance issues.

3. **`check_upper_bound_use`:** Placed just before the binary search call to ensure the operations inside the nested loops are not causing excessive `upper_bound` invocations. It uses a product of `n` and `m` as an indicator for loop iterations.

These checks will help in catching performance bottlenecks if the input data leads to conditions that are likely to trigger slow paths.
