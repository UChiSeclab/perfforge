system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

There are n candy boxes in front of Tania. The boxes are arranged in a row from left to right, numbered from 1 to n. The i-th box contains r_i candies, candies have the color c_i (the color can take one of three values ​​— red, green, or blue). All candies inside a single box have the same color (and it is equal to c_i).

Initially, Tanya is next to the box number s. Tanya can move to the neighbor box (that is, with a number that differs by one) or eat candies in the current box. Tanya eats candies instantly, but the movement takes one second.

If Tanya eats candies from the box, then the box itself remains in place, but there is no more candies in it. In other words, Tanya always eats all the candies from the box and candies in the boxes are not refilled.

It is known that Tanya cannot eat candies of the same color one after another (that is, the colors of candies in two consecutive boxes from which she eats candies are always different). In addition, Tanya's appetite is constantly growing, so in each next box from which she eats candies, there should be strictly more candies than in the previous one.

Note that for the first box from which Tanya will eat candies, there are no restrictions on the color and number of candies.

Tanya wants to eat at least k candies. What is the minimum number of seconds she will need? Remember that she eats candies instantly, and time is spent only on movements.

Input

The first line contains three integers n, s and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 50, 1 ≤ s ≤ n, 1 ≤ k ≤ 2000) — number of the boxes, initial position of Tanya and lower bound on number of candies to eat. The following line contains n integers r_i (1 ≤ r_i ≤ 50) — numbers of candies in the boxes. The third line contains sequence of n letters 'R', 'G' and 'B', meaning the colors of candies in the correspondent boxes ('R' for red, 'G' for green, 'B' for blue). Recall that each box contains candies of only one color. The third line contains no spaces.

Output

Print minimal number of seconds to eat at least k candies. If solution doesn't exist, print "-1".

Note

The sequence of actions of Tanya for the first example:

  * move from the box 3 to the box 2; 
  * eat candies from the box 2; 
  * move from the box 2 to the box 3; 
  * eat candy from the box 3; 
  * move from the box 3 to the box 4; 
  * move from the box 4 to the box 5; 
  * eat candies from the box 5. 



Since Tanya eats candy instantly, the required time is four seconds.

assistant: To analyze the performance bottlenecks of the given C program, let's proceed with the tasks outlined:

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Compare Line-Level Hit Counts**: 
   - The main bottleneck occurs in the loop inside the `while` statement (lines 22-37).
   - Specifically, lines 22 (`while (!q.empty())`) and 30 (`for (long long i = 1; i <= n; i++)`) have a significantly higher hit count in the slow input compared to the fast input.
   - The condition check in line 31 (`if (a[i] > a[pos] && color[pos - 1] != color[i - 1] && ...`) is frequently evaluated, which implies many iterations through the nested loop.

2. **Pinpoint Lines or Functions with More Hits**:
   - The `while` loop (line 22) is hit 69026 times in the slow input compared to 247 times in the fast input.
   - The nested `for` loop (line 30) is hit 3520275 times in the slow input compared to 12546 times in the fast input.
   - The most significant line is line 31, which checks conditions for moving Tanya, indicating this logic is repeated extensively for the slow input.

3. **Infer Interactions with Data Structures**:
   - The primary data structures are arrays for storing the number of candies and their colors.
   - The algorithm relies on a dynamic programming array `dp` to track the number of candies eaten and a priority queue `q` to determine the next moves.
   - Frequent evaluations in the `while` loop, especially the nested loop, suggest excessive checking or recalculations potentially due to input configurations.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **Generate Natural Language Statements**:
   - **Invariant 1**: When there exists a large range of box indices with candies counts and colors that frequently meet Tanya's conditions, the program may slow down significantly.
     - *Description*: "If there is a long contiguous sequence of boxes such that many of them have increasing candy counts and alternating candy colors, leading to many possible valid moves for Tanya, the program may experience a slowdown."

   - **Invariant 2**: When the position of Tanya is such that she is in a region with many valid candidate boxes to eat from, the checking logic might get repeatedly executed.
     - *Description*: "If Tanya starts in a region densely packed with boxes that have valid candy counts and colors for eating, the performance may degrade due to extensive searching and condition checking."

   - **Invariant 3**: If the number of boxes `n` is close to its upper limit and there are many high candy counts, performance is likely to slow due to frequent interactions in the nested loops.
     - *Description*: "If the number of boxes `n` is near the maximum value and the candy counts are high, especially with many boxes having similar counts, this could lead to a significant slowdown."

2. **Threshold Values and Problem Constraints**:
   - The constraints `n <= 50` and `k <= 2000` guide the thresholds for these invariants. Each invariant considers scenarios where checking all possible paths becomes computationally expensive.

3. **Correlate Conditions to Input Patterns**:
   - The slow input has a configuration of boxes with an increasing candy count and a particular pattern of colors, leading to a large number of potential valid paths, causing extensive evaluations.

The described invariants focus on understanding and anticipating scenarios where the algorithm's efficiency degrades due to complex input configurations, providing practical insights for future optimizations or detections in similar problems.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
There are n candy boxes in front of Tania. The boxes are arranged in a row from left to right, numbered from 1 to n. The i-th box contains r_i candies, candies have the color c_i (the color can take one of three values ​​— red, green, or blue). All candies inside a single box have the same color (and it is equal to c_i).

Initially, Tanya is next to the box number s. Tanya can move to the neighbor box (that is, with a number that differs by one) or eat candies in the current box. Tanya eats candies instantly, but the movement takes one second.

If Tanya eats candies from the box, then the box itself remains in place, but there is no more candies in it. In other words, Tanya always eats all the candies from the box and candies in the boxes are not refilled.

It is known that Tanya cannot eat candies of the same color one after another (that is, the colors of candies in two consecutive boxes from which she eats candies are always different). In addition, Tanya's appetite is constantly growing, so in each next box from which she eats candies, there should be strictly more candies than in the previous one.

Note that for the first box from which Tanya will eat candies, there are no restrictions on the color and number of candies.

Tanya wants to eat at least k candies. What is the minimum number of seconds she will need? Remember that she eats candies instantly, and time is spent only on movements.

Input

The first line contains three integers n, s and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 50, 1 ≤ s ≤ n, 1 ≤ k ≤ 2000) — number of the boxes, initial position of Tanya and lower bound on number of candies to eat. The following line contains n integers r_i (1 ≤ r_i ≤ 50) — numbers of candies in the boxes. The third line contains sequence of n letters 'R', 'G' and 'B', meaning the colors of candies in the correspondent boxes ('R' for red, 'G' for green, 'B' for blue). Recall that each box contains candies of only one color. The third line contains no spaces.

Output

Print minimal number of seconds to eat at least k candies. If solution doesn't exist, print "-1".

Note

The sequence of actions of Tanya for the first example:

  * move from the box 3 to the box 2; 
  * eat candies from the box 2; 
  * move from the box 2 to the box 3; 
  * eat candy from the box 3; 
  * move from the box 3 to the box 4; 
  * move from the box 4 to the box 5; 
  * eat candies from the box 5. 



Since Tanya eats candy instantly, the required time is four seconds.

Solution (C++ code):

assistant: ### Phase 3: Implementing Natural Language Invariants in C++

For each invariant from Phase 2, I will translate it into a C++ runtime check:

**Invariant 1: Long contiguous sequence of boxes with increasing candy counts and alternating colors.**

```cpp
void check_sequence_invariant(const long long* a, const string& color, long long n) {
    long long maxSequenceLength = 0;
    long long currentSequenceLength = 1;

    for (long long i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
        if (a[i] < a[i + 1] && color[i - 1] != color[i]) {
            ++currentSequenceLength;
        } else {
            maxSequenceLength = max(maxSequenceLength, currentSequenceLength);
            currentSequenceLength = 1;
        }
    }
    maxSequenceLength = max(maxSequenceLength, currentSequenceLength);

    if (maxSequenceLength > 10) { // Arbitrary threshold for detecting potentially long sequences
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck - long sequence of increasing candies and alternating colors." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

**Invariant 2: Tanya starts in a region densely packed with valid candidate boxes.**

```cpp
void check_density_invariant(const long long* a, const string& color, long long n, long long s) {
    long long validCandidateCount = 0;

    for (long long i = max(1LL, s - 5); i <= min(n, s + 5); ++i) { // Check a small range around the start
        if (a[i] > a[s] && color[i - 1] != color[s - 1]) {
            ++validCandidateCount;
        }
    }

    if (validCandidateCount > 5) { // Arbitrary threshold for dense regions
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck - dense region of valid candidate boxes." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

**Invariant 3: High values for `n` and candies with similar counts.**

```cpp
void check_candy_value_invariant(const long long* a, long long n) {
    long long similarCountRange = 0;
    for (long long i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
        if (a[i] == a[i + 1]) {
            ++similarCountRange;
        }
    }

    if (similarCountRange > 10) { // Arbitrary threshold for similar candy counts
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck - many boxes have similar candy counts." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrating Checkers Into the Original Program

Here is the instrumented C++ code with the integrated checkers:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
const long long N = 1e6 + 5;
long long dp[51][2051];
long long a[100];

void check_sequence_invariant(const long long* a, const string& color, long long n) {
    long long maxSequenceLength = 0;
    long long currentSequenceLength = 1;

    for (long long i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
        if (a[i] < a[i + 1] && color[i - 1] != color[i]) {
            ++currentSequenceLength;
        } else {
            maxSequenceLength = max(maxSequenceLength, currentSequenceLength);
            currentSequenceLength = 1;
        }
    }
    maxSequenceLength = max(maxSequenceLength, currentSequenceLength);

    if (maxSequenceLength > 10) { // Arbitrary threshold for detecting potentially long sequences
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck - long sequence of increasing candies and alternating colors." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_density_invariant(const long long* a, const string& color, long long n, long long s) {
    long long validCandidateCount = 0;

    for (long long i = max(1LL, s - 5); i <= min(n, s + 5); ++i) { // Check a small range around the start
        if (a[i] > a[s] && color[i - 1] != color[s - 1]) {
            ++validCandidateCount;
        }
    }

    if (validCandidateCount > 5) { // Arbitrary threshold for dense regions
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck - dense region of valid candidate boxes." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_candy_value_invariant(const long long* a, long long n) {
    long long similarCountRange = 0;
    for (long long i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
        if (a[i] == a[i + 1]) {
            ++similarCountRange;
        }
    }

    if (similarCountRange > 10) { // Arbitrary threshold for similar candy counts
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck - many boxes have similar candy counts." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void go() {
    long long n, s, k;
    cin >> n >> s >> k;
    for (long long i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        cin >> a[i];
    }
    memset(dp, -1, sizeof(dp));
    string color;
    cin >> color;

    // Checking invariants after reading input
    check_sequence_invariant(a, color, n);
    check_density_invariant(a, color, n, s);
    check_candy_value_invariant(a, n);

    priority_queue<pair<long long, long long>, vector<pair<long long, long long>>, greater<pair<long long, long long>>> q;
    for (long long i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        q.push({abs(i - s), i});
        dp[i][abs(i - s)] = a[i];
    }
    while (!q.empty()) {
        long long sec = q.top().first;
        long long pos = q.top().second;
        q.pop();
        if (dp[pos][sec] >= k) {
            cout << sec;
            return;
        }
        for (long long i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            if (a[i] > a[pos] && color[pos - 1] != color[i - 1] && dp[i][sec + abs(i - pos)] < dp[pos][sec] + a[i]) {
                q.push({sec + abs(i - pos), i});
                dp[i][sec + abs(i - pos)] = dp[pos][sec] + a[i];
            }
        }
    }
    cout << -1 << endl;
}

signed main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false), cin.tie(0), cout.tie(0);
    long long t = 1;
    cout << fixed << setprecision(12);
    while (t--) {
        go();
    }
}
```

### Explanation

- **Invariant Checks**: Each function checks one of the invariants we derived. These checks are performed once inputs are read, ensuring they do not affect the performance during the main computation loop.
- **Thresholds**: The thresholds are chosen to reflect scenarios where the input configuration could lead to slow execution, without directly relying on the specific slow input data.
- **Positioning**: The checks are placed right after reading inputs, which is optimal to detect any performance issue early and prevent unnecessary computations if conditions suggest a potential slowdown.
