system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

There are n candy boxes in front of Tania. The boxes are arranged in a row from left to right, numbered from 1 to n. The i-th box contains r_i candies, candies have the color c_i (the color can take one of three values ​​— red, green, or blue). All candies inside a single box have the same color (and it is equal to c_i).

Initially, Tanya is next to the box number s. Tanya can move to the neighbor box (that is, with a number that differs by one) or eat candies in the current box. Tanya eats candies instantly, but the movement takes one second.

If Tanya eats candies from the box, then the box itself remains in place, but there is no more candies in it. In other words, Tanya always eats all the candies from the box and candies in the boxes are not refilled.

It is known that Tanya cannot eat candies of the same color one after another (that is, the colors of candies in two consecutive boxes from which she eats candies are always different). In addition, Tanya's appetite is constantly growing, so in each next box from which she eats candies, there should be strictly more candies than in the previous one.

Note that for the first box from which Tanya will eat candies, there are no restrictions on the color and number of candies.

Tanya wants to eat at least k candies. What is the minimum number of seconds she will need? Remember that she eats candies instantly, and time is spent only on movements.

Input

The first line contains three integers n, s and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 50, 1 ≤ s ≤ n, 1 ≤ k ≤ 2000) — number of the boxes, initial position of Tanya and lower bound on number of candies to eat. The following line contains n integers r_i (1 ≤ r_i ≤ 50) — numbers of candies in the boxes. The third line contains sequence of n letters 'R', 'G' and 'B', meaning the colors of candies in the correspondent boxes ('R' for red, 'G' for green, 'B' for blue). Recall that each box contains candies of only one color. The third line contains no spaces.

Output

Print minimal number of seconds to eat at least k candies. If solution doesn't exist, print "-1".

Note

The sequence of actions of Tanya for the first example:

  * move from the box 3 to the box 2; 
  * eat candies from the box 2; 
  * move from the box 2 to the box 3; 
  * eat candy from the box 3; 
  * move from the box 3 to the box 4; 
  * move from the box 4 to the box 5; 
  * eat candies from the box 5. 



Since Tanya eats candy instantly, the required time is four seconds.

assistant: ### Phase 1: Identifying Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

Based on the hit count information, we can identify a few key areas in the code that are significantly more active during the execution with the slow input compared to the fast input:

1. **Line 15:** `return d[u.x][u.pre];` - This line within the `operator[]` function has a very high hit count in the slow input. This indicates frequent access to the 2D array `d`, suggesting heavy use of lookups.

2. **Lines 22-23:** The function `upd` is heavily used in both inputs, but especially in the slow input. It is used to update the queue with potential new states and indicates that the number of potential states processed is much larger in the slow input.

3. **Lines 49-53:** The main loop processing elements in the queue (`while (!q1.empty())` and subsequent lines) is executed many more times in the slow input. This suggests that the algorithm is exploring a significantly larger state space.

4. **Lines 54-71:** These lines handle movement to adjacent boxes and check the conditions for Tanya to eat candies. The high hit count implies many iterations over possible movements, and many condition checks for valid candy eating moves.

### Phase 2: Deriving Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Given the above analysis, here are some performance-characterizing invariants that describe conditions leading to slow execution in natural language:

1. **State Space Exploration:**
   - **Invariant:** "If the sequence of boxes requires exploring a large state space to find a valid eating path, the execution time increases. This can occur when the constraints on candy color and quantity changes frequently restrict direct paths."
   - **Explanation:** The program's performance is slowed when there are many permutations to explore due to tight constraints on color and candy quantity, which prevent straightforward traversal.

2. **Frequent State Checks:**
   - **Invariant:** "When there are many boxes with similar or incrementing candy counts, and diverse candy colors, the algorithm spends more time checking possible states due to increased branching."
   - **Explanation:** The high hit counts in state verification indicate frequent checks needed due to constraints on candy numbers and colors, leading to performance degradation.

3. **Complex Input Patterns:**
   - **Invariant:** "When the initial position is far from optimal starting points for candy consumption, resulting in longer movement before finding valid sequence paths, the program's time to solution increases."
   - **Explanation:** The need to traverse many boxes to find initial valid conditions for candy eating leads to increased processing time.

By considering these invariants, we can understand the conditions that trigger slow execution in this problem. The constraints on movement and eating force the algorithm to explore many potential paths, particularly when initial conditions are not favorable or when many constraints interact simultaneously.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
There are n candy boxes in front of Tania. The boxes are arranged in a row from left to right, numbered from 1 to n. The i-th box contains r_i candies, candies have the color c_i (the color can take one of three values ​​— red, green, or blue). All candies inside a single box have the same color (and it is equal to c_i).

Initially, Tanya is next to the box number s. Tanya can move to the neighbor box (that is, with a number that differs by one) or eat candies in the current box. Tanya eats candies instantly, but the movement takes one second.

If Tanya eats candies from the box, then the box itself remains in place, but there is no more candies in it. In other words, Tanya always eats all the candies from the box and candies in the boxes are not refilled.

It is known that Tanya cannot eat candies of the same color one after another (that is, the colors of candies in two consecutive boxes from which she eats candies are always different). In addition, Tanya's appetite is constantly growing, so in each next box from which she eats candies, there should be strictly more candies than in the previous one.

Note that for the first box from which Tanya will eat candies, there are no restrictions on the color and number of candies.

Tanya wants to eat at least k candies. What is the minimum number of seconds she will need? Remember that she eats candies instantly, and time is spent only on movements.

Input

The first line contains three integers n, s and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 50, 1 ≤ s ≤ n, 1 ≤ k ≤ 2000) — number of the boxes, initial position of Tanya and lower bound on number of candies to eat. The following line contains n integers r_i (1 ≤ r_i ≤ 50) — numbers of candies in the boxes. The third line contains sequence of n letters 'R', 'G' and 'B', meaning the colors of candies in the correspondent boxes ('R' for red, 'G' for green, 'B' for blue). Recall that each box contains candies of only one color. The third line contains no spaces.

Output

Print minimal number of seconds to eat at least k candies. If solution doesn't exist, print "-1".

Examples

Input

5 3 10
1 2 3 4 5
RGBRR


Output

4


Input

5 6
RG


Output

-1

Note

The sequence of actions of Tanya for the first example:

  * move from the box 3 to the box 2; 
  * eat candies from the box 2; 
  * move from the box 2 to the box 3; 
  * eat candy from the box 3; 
  * move from the box 3 to the box 4; 
  * move from the box 4 to the box 5; 
  * eat candies from the box 5. 



Since Tanya eats candy instantly, the required time is four seconds.

Solution (C++ code):
{solution}


assistant: ### Phase 3: Implementing Performance-Characterizing Invariants in C++

Below are the C++ code snippets implementing the performance-characterizing invariants derived earlier:

1. **State Space Exploration:**

```cpp
void check_state_space_invariant(int exploredStates) {
    if (exploredStates > 10000) {  // threshold based on empirical observation
        cerr << "Warning: state_space_invariant triggered - large state space exploration!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

2. **Frequent State Checks:**

```cpp
void check_frequent_state_checks_invariant(int stateChecks) {
    if (stateChecks > 20000) {  // threshold based on empirical observation
        cerr << "Warning: frequent_state_checks_invariant triggered - excessive state checks!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

3. **Complex Input Patterns:**

```cpp
void check_complex_input_patterns_invariant(int currentPosition, int initialPosition, int steps) {
    if (abs(currentPosition - initialPosition) > 20 && steps > 100) {  // arbitrary parameters for complexity
        cerr << "Warning: complex_input_patterns_invariant triggered - complex input pattern detected!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrating Checkers into the Original C++ Program

Here is the instrumented C++ code with the runtime checks integrated into it. I will place the checks at appropriate points in the control flow to avoid adding overhead in tight loops.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
const int N = 55;
int n, k, d[N];
char c[N];
struct dt {
  int x, pre;
  inline __attribute__((always_inline)) dt(int x = 0, int pre = 0)
      : x(x), pre(pre) {}
};
queue<dt> q1, q2;
struct memt {
  int d[N][N];
  inline __attribute__((always_inline)) int& operator[](const dt u) {
    return d[u.x][u.pre];
  }
  inline __attribute__((always_inline)) void clear() {
    memset(d, 255, sizeof(d));
  }
} r[2];
inline __attribute__((always_inline)) void upd(dt u, int v, int a) {
  if (r[a][u] == -1) q2.push(u);
  if (v > r[a][u]) r[a][u] = v;
}
bool ex[N];

// Checker function for large state space
void check_state_space_invariant(int exploredStates) {
    if (exploredStates > 10000) {  // threshold based on empirical observation
        cerr << "Warning: state_space_invariant triggered - large state space exploration!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Checker function for frequent state checks
void check_frequent_state_checks_invariant(int stateChecks) {
    if (stateChecks > 20000) {  // threshold based on empirical observation
        cerr << "Warning: frequent_state_checks_invariant triggered - excessive state checks!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Checker function for complex input patterns
void check_complex_input_patterns_invariant(int currentPosition, int initialPosition, int steps) {
    if (abs(currentPosition - initialPosition) > 20 && steps > 100) {  // arbitrary parameters for complexity
        cerr << "Warning: complex_input_patterns_invariant triggered - complex input pattern detected!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
  int s;
  scanf("%d%d%d", &n, &s, &k);
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) scanf("%d", &d[i]), ex[d[i]] = 1;
  if (d[s] >= k) return puts("0"), 0;
  scanf("%s", c + 1);
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
    if (c[i] == 'R')
      c[i] = 1;
    else if (c[i] == 'G')
      c[i] = 2;
    else if (c[i] == 'B')
      c[i] = 3;
    else
      exit(1);
  }
  c[0] = 0;
  int ans = 0;
  r[0].clear(), r[1].clear();
  upd(dt(s, 0), 0, 0), upd(dt(s, s), d[s], 0);
  q1.swap(q2);

  // Variables to track state space exploration and checks
  int exploredStates = 0;
  int stateChecks = 0;

  for (; ans <= n * n; ++ans) {
    int a = ans & 1;
    while (!q1.empty()) {
      dt u = q1.front();
      q1.pop();
      int v = r[a][u];

      // Increment state checks
      stateChecks++;

      if (v >= k) goto ed;
      if (u.x + 1 <= n) {
        dt nu = u;
        ++nu.x;
        upd(nu, v, a ^ 1);

        // Increment explored states
        exploredStates++;

        if (d[u.pre] < d[nu.x] && c[u.pre] != c[nu.x]) {
          nu.pre = nu.x;
          upd(nu, v + d[nu.x], a ^ 1);
        }
      }
      if (1 <= u.x - 1) {
        dt nu = u;
        --nu.x;
        upd(nu, v, a ^ 1);

        // Increment explored states
        exploredStates++;

        if (d[u.pre] < d[nu.x] && c[u.pre] != c[nu.x]) {
          nu.pre = nu.x;
          upd(nu, v + d[nu.x], a ^ 1);
        }
      }
    }
    q1.swap(q2);
    r[a].clear();

    // Perform checks at the end of each iteration
    check_state_space_invariant(exploredStates);
    check_frequent_state_checks_invariant(stateChecks);
    check_complex_input_patterns_invariant(q1.front().x, s, ans);
  }
ed:
  printf("%d\n", ans > n * n ? -1 : ans);
  return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

- **State Space Exploration Checker:** This checker is placed after updating potential states (`exploredStates`) and is called at the end of each iteration of the main loop.
- **Frequent State Checks Checker:** Incremented for every state check, this ensures we are not performing excessive checks.
- **Complex Input Patterns Checker:** This is speculative and checks if the current position is far from the starting position after many steps, indicating a potentially complex traversal pattern.

The inserted checks are intended to identify the performance bottlenecks characterized by the invariants without adding significant overhead in the main loop.
