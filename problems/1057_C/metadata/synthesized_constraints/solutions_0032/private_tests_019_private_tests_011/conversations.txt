system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

There are n candy boxes in front of Tania. The boxes are arranged in a row from left to right, numbered from 1 to n. The i-th box contains r_i candies, candies have the color c_i (the color can take one of three values ​​— red, green, or blue). All candies inside a single box have the same color (and it is equal to c_i).

Initially, Tanya is next to the box number s. Tanya can move to the neighbor box (that is, with a number that differs by one) or eat candies in the current box. Tanya eats candies instantly, but the movement takes one second.

If Tanya eats candies from the box, then the box itself remains in place, but there is no more candies in it. In other words, Tanya always eats all the candies from the box and candies in the boxes are not refilled.

It is known that Tanya cannot eat candies of the same color one after another (that is, the colors of candies in two consecutive boxes from which she eats candies are always different). In addition, Tanya's appetite is constantly growing, so in each next box from which she eats candies, there should be strictly more candies than in the previous one.

Note that for the first box from which Tanya will eat candies, there are no restrictions on the color and number of candies.

Tanya wants to eat at least k candies. What is the minimum number of seconds she will need? Remember that she eats candies instantly, and time is spent only on movements.

Input

The first line contains three integers n, s and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 50, 1 ≤ s ≤ n, 1 ≤ k ≤ 2000) — number of the boxes, initial position of Tanya and lower bound on number of candies to eat. The following line contains n integers r_i (1 ≤ r_i ≤ 50) — numbers of candies in the boxes. The third line contains sequence of n letters 'R', 'G' and 'B', meaning the colors of candies in the correspondent boxes ('R' for red, 'G' for green, 'B' for blue). Recall that each box contains candies of only one color. The third line contains no spaces.

Output

Print minimal number of seconds to eat at least k candies. If solution doesn't exist, print "-1".

Note

The sequence of actions of Tanya for the first example:

  * move from the box 3 to the box 2; 
  * eat candies from the box 2; 
  * move from the box 2 to the box 3; 
  * eat candy from the box 3; 
  * move from the box 3 to the box 4; 
  * move from the box 4 to the box 5; 
  * eat candies from the box 5. 



Since Tanya eats candy instantly, the required time is four seconds.

assistant: To diagnose why the program runs slowly for the given slow input and derive performance-characterizing invariants, we need to analyze the provided C program focusing on the differences in behavior between the fast and slow inputs. Here’s the analysis broken down into phases:

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Compare Line-level Hit Counts**: 
   - The `heapify` and `heapSort` functions are heavily involved in the slow input but not in the fast input. These functions are called 274 times for `heapify` and 1 time for `heapSort` during the slow run but not at all during the fast run.
   - The nested loops starting from lines 58, 59, and 67 are executed significantly more times for the slow input (`245,104` times on line 67) compared to the fast input (not executed at all).
   - The initialization of arrays `a` and `b` from lines 52 to 56 is executed 1275 times for the slow input, indicating a larger computation.

2. **Identify Significant Lines/Loops**:
   - The nested loop structure from lines 58 to 77 and lines 79 to 83 suggest complex calculations that involve checking and updating multiple arrays (`a` and `b`). Specifically, the inner loop from line 67 to 75 indicates an expensive operation involving conditions based on the difference between candy counts and positions.
   - The loop on line 79 suggests a significant number of operations related to array copying.

3. **Interactions with Data Structures**:
   - The program uses dynamic programming concepts, storing state information in arrays `a` and `b` to calculate minimum movement times based on constraints.
   - Sorting with `heapSort` may be preparing the data for efficient access during this computation but adds initial overhead.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the analysis above, the following natural language performance invariants describe conditions under which the code may enter a slow path:

1. **Invariant 1: Sorting Overhead**
   - **Description**: “When the input array of candies is already sorted or nearly sorted, the additional sorting step using `heapSort` incurs unnecessary overhead, potentially slowing down execution for larger datasets.”
   - **Implication**: The sorting operation itself, though efficient, may be redundant if the input array is already sorted, causing unnecessary overhead and delaying subsequent computations.

2. **Invariant 2: High Combinatorial Complexity**
   - **Description**: “If the boxes are primarily of one color followed by a sharp contrast (e.g., multiple boxes of the same color followed by a different color), it significantly increases the number of candidate paths Tanya must evaluate, thus increasing computation time.”
   - **Implication**: This invariant suggests that when many boxes of the same color are present consecutively, the algorithm’s path evaluation complexity increases due to restricted candy color choices.

3. **Invariant 3: Nested Loop Complexity**
   - **Description**: “When the sum of candies (`sum`) in the boxes is large relative to `k`, and there exists a need to backtrack or evaluate multiple paths, the nested loop structure results in high computational overhead.”
   - **Implication**: This condition indicates that for large `sum` values, the nested loops evaluating potential candy sequences can become computationally expensive, especially in scenarios requiring exhaustive evaluation of possible paths.

4. **Invariant 4: Data Structure Size**
   - **Description**: “If the dynamic programming arrays `a` and `b` need to be utilized for a wide range of indices due to the high diversity in box configurations, it results in large memory usage and increased computation time.”
   - **Implication**: When the problem constraints necessitate using the entire range of possible candy sums, the additional memory usage and iteration overhead can lead to slowdowns.

These performance-characterizing invariants abstract the causes of slowdown and help identify potential future inputs that might trigger similar behavior, ensuring that any optimizations can address these core computational challenges.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
There are n candy boxes in front of Tania. The boxes are arranged in a row from left to right, numbered from 1 to n. The i-th box contains r_i candies, candies have the color c_i (the color can take one of three values ​​— red, green, or blue). All candies inside a single box have the same color (and it is equal to c_i).

Initially, Tanya is next to the box number s. Tanya can move to the neighbor box (that is, with a number that differs by one) or eat candies in the current box. Tanya eats candies instantly, but the movement takes one second.

If Tanya eats candies from the box, then the box itself remains in place, but there is no more candies in it. In other words, Tanya always eats all the candies from the box and candies in the boxes are not refilled.

It is known that Tanya cannot eat candies of the same color one after another (that is, the colors of candies in two consecutive boxes from which she eats candies are always different). In addition, Tanya's appetite is constantly growing, so in each next box from which she eats candies, there should be strictly more candies than in the previous one.

Note that for the first box from which Tanya will eat candies, there are no restrictions on the color and number of candies.

Tanya wants to eat at least k candies. What is the minimum number of seconds she will need? Remember that she eats candies instantly, and time is spent only on movements.

Input

The first line contains three integers n, s and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 50, 1 ≤ s ≤ n, 1 ≤ k ≤ 2000) — number of the boxes, initial position of Tanya and lower bound on number of candies to eat. The following line contains n integers r_i (1 ≤ r_i ≤ 50) — numbers of candies in the boxes. The third line contains sequence of n letters 'R', 'G' and 'B', meaning the colors of candies in the correspondent boxes ('R' for red, 'G' for green, 'B' for blue). Recall that each box contains candies of only one color. The third line contains no spaces.

Output

Print minimal number of seconds to eat at least k candies. If solution doesn't exist, print "-1".

Examples

Input

5 3 10
1 2 3 4 5

Output

Note

The sequence of actions of Tanya for the first example:

  * move from the box 3 to the box 2; 
  * eat candies from the box 2; 
  * move from the box 2 to the box 3; 
  * eat candy from the box 3; 
  * move from the box 3 to the box 4; 
  * move from the box 4 to the box 5; 
  * eat candies from the box 5. 



Since Tanya eats candy instantly, the required time is four seconds.

Solution (C++ code):
{solution}


assistant: To perform the tasks outlined in Phase 3 and Phase 4, I will first convert the performance-characterizing invariants derived previously into C++ checkers. Then, I'll integrate these checkers into the given C++ code.

### Phase 3: Implementing the Invariants in C++ Checkers

#### Invariant 1: Sorting Overhead Checker

    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - redundant sorting of an already sorted array!" << endl;

    }
}

    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high combinatorial complexity due to uniform color distribution!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

#### Invariant 3: Nested Loop Complexity Checker

void check_nested_loop_complexity(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - nested loops with a large range of indices!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Explanation

- **Sorting Overhead Check**: This check is placed right after reading the inputs to verify if the array is already sorted.
- **Combinatorial Complexity Check**: This check looks for uniform color distribution, which might lead to high complexity in path evaluation.
- **Nested Loop Complexity**: Not directly checked as a separate invariant because its conditions are more intrinsic to the algorithm's operations.
- **Data Structure Size Check**: This check is placed before loops that heavily utilize the arrays `a` and `b`, ensuring they are not overly large for the input constraints.

These checks will help identify potential performance bottlenecks during execution, giving insights into which conditions slow down the program most.
