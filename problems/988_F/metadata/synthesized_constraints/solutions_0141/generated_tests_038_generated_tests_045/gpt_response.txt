=== Invariants Response ===
To analyze the performance bottlenecks in the provided C program, we need to follow the tasks outlined in the problem. We'll go through the steps and then derive performance-characterizing invariants.

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Compare Line-Level Hit Counts:**
   - The recursive function `Rec` has significantly higher hit counts for the slow input (`slow_hit_count: 6000998`) compared to the fast input (`fast_hit_count: 1875443`).

2. **Pinpoint Lines with Significant Hit Count Differences:**
   - The recursive function's base case and memoization check (lines 7 and 8) have very high hit counts.
   - Lines 9-13, which handle the core logic of the recursive function, are executed significantly more for the slow input than the fast input. This suggests the recursive function is exploring a larger state space due to different input conditions.

3. **Infer Interaction with Data Structures and Constraints:**
   - The recursive function utilizes `dp` for memoization, which involves a 2D array of size `[2010][2010]`.
   - The recursive calls seem to explore many states due to the rain segments and the umbrella weights, possibly related to the number of overlapping conditions and the cost of carrying umbrellas.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **Generate Natural Language Statements:**

   - **Invariant 1:** "The recursive function's performance degrades when the effective recursion depth becomes large, which happens when Polycarp's path involves many umbrella swaps or prolonged carrying due to sparse umbrella placement relative to rain segments."

   - **Invariant 2:** "If the number of recursive states that need evaluation becomes large due to many rain segments and scarce umbrellas, the computation becomes expensive. This often correlates with a high number of states being memoized."

   - **Invariant 3:** "Performance may degrade significantly when rain segments are such that Polycarp has limited choice but to carry heavy umbrellas over long distances, especially if the cost of all available umbrellas is high."

2. **Ensure Thresholds Adhere to Constraints:**
   - The input constraints (like `1 ≤ a, m ≤ 2000` and `1 ≤ n ≤ ⌈a/2⌉`) dictate that the potential number of rain segments and umbrellas can lead to a large number of decision states, especially if rain segments cover substantial parts of the path without sufficient umbrella distribution.

3. **Correlate Conditions to Input Patterns:**
   - Performance issues are likely to occur when:
     - There are long stretches of rain with minimal umbrellas, forcing Polycarp to carry heavy umbrellas.
     - Rain segments are near the maximum allowable (`n` close to `a/2`), creating many overlapping conditions that increase the state space for the dynamic programming solution.

These performance-characterizing invariants help identify scenarios under which the program is likely to run slowly, based on observed patterns in input conditions and recursive state exploration.

=== Checker Response ===
### Phase 3: Implement the Natural Language Invariants as C++ Checkers

We'll translate the previously derived performance-characterizing invariants into C++ code snippets that can be integrated into the program to detect conditions leading to slow execution.

#### Invariant 1:
"The recursive function's performance degrades when the effective recursion depth becomes large, which happens when Polycarp's path involves many umbrella swaps or prolonged carrying due to sparse umbrella placement relative to rain segments."

```cpp
void check_recursion_depth_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high effective recursion depth or prolonged carrying due to sparse umbrellas." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

#### Invariant 2:
"If the number of recursive states that need evaluation becomes large due to many rain segments and scarce umbrellas, the computation becomes expensive. This often correlates with a high number of states being memoized."

```cpp
void check_memoization_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large number of recursive states due to rain segments and sparse umbrellas." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

#### Invariant 3:
"Performance may degrade significantly when rain segments are such that Polycarp has limited choice but to carry heavy umbrellas over long distances, especially if the cost of all available umbrellas is high."

```cpp
void check_umbrella_weight_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - heavy umbrellas carried over long distances." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrate the Checker Code into the Original Program

Now, we need to integrate these runtime checks into the C++ code, placing them at strategic points in the program flow to detect potential performance bottlenecks without adding overhead to tight loops.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

long long a, n, m, l, r, rain[2010], w[2010], End[2010];
const long long Inf = 1e11;
long long dp[2010][2010];

void check_recursion_depth_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high effective recursion depth or prolonged carrying due to sparse umbrellas." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_memoization_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large number of recursive states due to rain segments and sparse umbrellas." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_umbrella_weight_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - heavy umbrellas carried over long distances." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

long long Rec(long long i, long long taken) {
    // Check recursion depth and memoization usage
    check_recursion_depth_invariant(i > 1000);
    check_memoization_invariant(dp[i][taken] != -1);

    if (i == a + 1) return 0;
    if (dp[i][taken] != -1) return dp[i][taken];

    long long Res1 = Inf, Res2 = Inf, Res3 = Inf;
    if (w[i]) Res1 = w[i] + Rec(i + 1, i);
    if (taken) Res2 = w[taken] + Rec(i + 1, taken);
    if (!rain[i] || End[i]) Res3 = Rec(i + 1, 0);

    // Check if carrying heavy umbrellas over extended distances
    check_umbrella_weight_invariant((Res1 > 10 * a) || (Res2 > 10 * a));

    return dp[i][taken] = min(Res1, min(Res2, Res3));
}

int main() {
    cin >> a >> n >> m;

    for (long long i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        cin >> l >> r;
        l++;
        r++;
        End[r]++;
        for (long long j = l; j <= r; j++) rain[j]++;
    }

    for (long long i = 1; i <= a; i++) w[i] = Inf;

    for (long long i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        cin >> l >> r;
        l++;
        w[l] = min(r, w[l]);
    }

    memset(dp, -1, sizeof(dp));

    Rec(1, 0) >= Inf ? cout << "-1" : cout << Rec(1, 0);
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of Changes:

1. **`check_recursion_depth_invariant`** is called at the start of the `Rec` function to monitor recursive depth.
2. **`check_memoization_invariant`** checks whether the recursive state has already been computed, indicating the exploration of many states.
3. **`check_umbrella_weight_invariant`** checks if the burden of the cumulative weight of umbrellas exceeds a reasonable threshold, assuming `10 * a` is a hypothetical threshold indicating heavy loads. 

These checks strategically help identify performance bottlenecks without affecting core loop logic, providing insights when unusual patterns are encountered in execution.
