=== Invariants Response ===
To analyze the performance bottlenecks of the provided C program and derive performance-characterizing invariants, we proceed in two phases:

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Hit Count Analysis**:
   - The dynamic programming function `dp(int i, int u)` is the main area where the program spends most of its execution time. This function is invoked 6,002,996 times for the slow input versus 1,876,559 times for the fast input.
   - The specific lines inside the `dp` function that are hit significantly more during the execution of the slow input are lines 9, 10, 11, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 20.
   - This suggests that the recursive calls and memoization checks (lines 9 and 10) are crucial contributors to the increased execution times.

2. **Pattern of Calls**:
   - **Memoization Check**: The line `if (ret != -1) return ret;` (line 10) suggests that the memoization table (`memo`) is not being utilized effectively, leading to repeated computations.
   - **Branching**: The branching conditions regarding whether it's raining or not (`rain[i]` on line 11) indicate that different paths of execution are being taken for the slow input compared to the fast input.
   - **Recursive Calls**: Lines 12, 13, 16, 17, and 18 indicate multiple recursive calls within the `dp` function, which can accumulate to a high number of calls, especially when the memoization isn't effectively reducing the repeated computations.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the insights gained from the hit count analysis, we can generate a set of natural language performance invariants:

1. **High Recursive Depth with Inadequate Memoization**:
   - **Description**: "A significant slowdown occurs when the recursive function explores many states due to inadequate memoization, especially when transitioning between rainy and non-rainy segments."
   - **Condition**: This happens when the memoization table (`memo`) is not utilized effectively, leading to repeated recursive calls for the same states.

2. **Large Combination of Umbrella States**:
   - **Description**: "Performance degrades when a large number of umbrella states need to be evaluated, particularly when there are many umbrella positions that Polycarp can pick up or drop off along the path."
   - **Condition**: Occurs when the number of umbrellas (`m`) and their strategic placements lead to multiple recursive evaluations over similar paths.

3. **Transition Between Rainy Segments**:
   - **Description**: "The program slows down when there are frequent transitions between rainy and non-rainy segments, forcing repeated evaluations of umbrella pick-up/drop logic."
   - **Condition**: This is related to how the rain segments (`n`) are distributed, causing the DP function to evaluate multiple combinations of umbrella pick-ups and drops.

### General Observations

- **Recursive Explosions**: Recursive calls can exponentially increase when rain segments require different umbrella configurations, especially when memoization does not adequately cache results due to varied umbrella weights and positions.
- **Condition Complexity**: The complexity arises not from the number of rain segments or umbrellas themselves directly, but from the interaction pattern of these elements as Polycarp transitions from one state to another.

### Simplifying Assumptions

- Consider the constraints (`n <= 100`, `1 ≤ a, m ≤ 2000`) when determining threshold conditions, keeping in mind how these boundaries impact the recursive state space explosion and memoization effectiveness.

By identifying these characteristics, we can better understand why the program slows down for certain inputs and potentially improve its performance by optimizing the memoization strategy and managing recursive calls more effectively.

=== Checker Response ===
To address Phase 3, we convert the natural language invariants derived earlier into C++ runtime checks. These checks will trigger warnings and abort the program when specific performance-degrading conditions are met.

### Phase 3: Implement Performance-Characterizing Invariants as Checker Code

1. **High Recursive Depth with Inadequate Memoization**:
   ```cpp
   void check_memoization_efficiency(bool condition) {
       if (condition) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck detected due to inadequate memoization!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Large Combination of Umbrella States**:
   ```cpp
   void check_umbrella_states(bool condition) {
       if (condition) {
           cerr << "Warning: Potential slowdown from evaluating large combinations of umbrella states!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Transition Between Rainy Segments**:
   ```cpp
   void check_rain_transition(bool condition) {
       if (condition) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance issue due to frequent transitions between rain segments!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Integrate Checker Code into the Original Program

Below is the instrumented C++ code with the checker functions integrated at strategic points:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int n, m, a;
long long memo[2020][2020];
long long umb[2020];
int rain[2020];

void check_memoization_efficiency(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck detected due to inadequate memoization!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_umbrella_states(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Potential slowdown from evaluating large combinations of umbrella states!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_rain_transition(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance issue due to frequent transitions between rain segments!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

long long dp(int i, int u) {
    // Check for high recursive depth without effective memoization
    check_memoization_efficiency(memo[i][u] == -1 && i > 1500); // Example threshold
    
    if (i == a) return 0;
    long long &ret = memo[i][u];
    if (ret != -1) return ret;
    
    if (rain[i]) {
        ret = umb[i] + dp(i + 1, i);
        if (u != a) ret = min(ret, umb[u] + dp(i + 1, u));
    } else {
        long long w = (u == a) ? 0 : umb[u];
        ret = w + dp(i + 1, u);
        ret = min(ret, dp(i + 1, a));
        ret = min(ret, umb[i] + dp(i + 1, i));
    }
    
    return ret;
}

int main() {
    ios::sync_with_stdio(0);
    cin.tie(0);
    
    cin >> a >> n >> m;
    
    // Check for large umbrella states
    check_umbrella_states(m > 1800); // Example threshold

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        int L, R;
        cin >> L >> R;
        
        // Check for frequent transitions between rain segments
        check_rain_transition((R - L) < 2 && i > 0); // Example threshold
        
        for (int j = L; j < R; j++) rain[j] = 1;
    }
    
    for (int i = 0; i < a + 10; i++) umb[i] = 1e14;
    
    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        long long x, p;
        cin >> x >> p;
        umb[x] = min(umb[x], p);
    }
    
    memset(memo, -1, sizeof memo);
    long long ans = dp(0, a);
    if (ans > 1e13) ans = -1;
    cout << ans << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of Inserted Checks:

1. **Memoization Efficiency Check**: Placed inside the `dp` function to warn if memoization is not effectively used, potentially leading to high recursive depth without caching.

2. **Umbrella States Check**: Inserted in `main` function after reading the number of umbrellas to warn if a high number of umbrellas may lead to performance issues from large state evaluations.

3. **Rain Transition Check**: Added when reading rain segments to detect frequent transitions between rainy segments, which could increase the state space and complexity.

These checks are strategically placed to avoid adding overhead in critical loops while ensuring potential performance bottlenecks are detected early in the program's execution.
