### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

By analyzing the hit counts, we can see that some lines in the `fatigue` function are significantly more hit with the slow input compared to the fast input:

1. **Lines 9-11 (memoization check):** These lines are hit more frequently in the slow input, suggesting that the memoization is being exercised extensively, indicating repeated state exploration.
   
2. **Line 15 (carrying umbrella while moving):** This line is also hit significantly more in the slow input. This indicates that the code is frequently calculating the fatigue with picked-up umbrellas.

3. **Line 20 (continue with the current umbrella):** This line's hit count is higher in the slow input, suggesting repeated calls to the `fatigue` function while continuing to use the same umbrella.

4. **Line 23 (move without an umbrella when not raining):** The high hit count here implies that the program is frequently exploring the option of moving without an umbrella, possibly due to a large number of non-rainy segments.

The increased hits in these areas suggest that the program is exploring many possible paths through the problem space, likely due to the recursive nature of the solution combined with the constraints on umbrella usage and rain segments.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the analysis, here are potential natural language performance invariants:

1. **Exhaustive State Exploration Due to Sparse Rain/Weak Memoization:**
   - "If the rain segments are sparse and memoization is not effective, the recursive function may explore numerous states, leading to high computational cost."

2. **Umbrella Weight and Distribution Impact:**
   - "If umbrellas are distributed such that several are required within small segments, or if the weights are high, the burden of carrying them accumulates, increasing fatigue computation."

3. **Complex Path Decisions Due to Multiple Non-Rain Segments:**
   - "When there are many non-rainy segments interspersed with rain segments, the decision-making complexity increases, thereby causing multiple recursive calls exploring different possible paths."

4. **High Complexity with Few Available Umbrellas:**
   - "If there are very few umbrellas relative to the number of rain segments, or each umbrella is required for multiple, non-overlapping segments, the program may enter expensive decision paths to satisfy constraints."

These conditions serve as indicators of potential slow performance scenarios, especially under the provided constraints (such as `n <= 100` and `a, m <= 2000`). They capture scenarios where the recursion depth or state exploration could become particularly burdensome, leading to increased execution time.

### Phase 3: Implementing the Natural Language Invariants in C++

Based on the performance-characterizing invariants derived earlier, here are the C++ code snippets implementing those checks:

1. **Excessive State Exploration Due to Sparse Rain/Weak Memoization:**
   ```cpp
   void check_memoization_efficiency(int pos, int memoSizeThreshold) {
       if (memo[pos].size() > memoSizeThreshold) {
           cerr << "Warning: Excessive memoization states explored - potential inefficiency!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Umbrella Weight and Distribution Impact:**
   ```cpp
   void check_umbrella_weight_and_distribution(int position, int weightThreshold) {
       if (umbrella[position] > weightThreshold) {
           cerr << "Warning: High umbrella weight impacting fatigue!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Complex Path Decisions Due to Multiple Non-Rain Segments:**
   ```cpp
   void check_path_decision_complexity(int pos, int nonRainSegmentThreshold) {
       static int nonRainCount = 0;
       if (!rain[pos]) {
           nonRainCount++;
           if (nonRainCount > nonRainSegmentThreshold) {
               cerr << "Warning: High complexity due to multiple non-rain segments!" << endl;
               abort();
           }
       } else {
           nonRainCount = 0; // reset when encountering rain
       }
   }
   ```

4. **High Complexity with Few Available Umbrellas:**
   ```cpp
   void check_umbrella_availability(int availableUmbrellas, int umbrellaThreshold) {
       if (availableUmbrellas < umbrellaThreshold) {
           cerr << "Warning: Insufficient umbrellas for rainy segments!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Integrating Checkers into the Original C++ Code

Now, we'll integrate these checks into the existing C++ program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int a, n, m, inf = (int)1e9;
vector<unordered_map<int, int>> memo;
vector<int> rain;
vector<int> umbrella;

// Performance checkers
void check_memoization_efficiency(int pos, int memoSizeThreshold) {
    if (memo[pos].size() > memoSizeThreshold) {
        cerr << "Warning: Excessive memoization states explored - potential inefficiency!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_umbrella_weight_and_distribution(int position, int weightThreshold) {
    if (umbrella[position] > weightThreshold) {
        cerr << "Warning: High umbrella weight impacting fatigue!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_path_decision_complexity(int pos, int nonRainSegmentThreshold) {
    static int nonRainCount = 0;
    if (!rain[pos]) {
        nonRainCount++;
        if (nonRainCount > nonRainSegmentThreshold) {
            cerr << "Warning: High complexity due to multiple non-rain segments!" << endl;
            abort();
        }
    } else {
        nonRainCount = 0; // reset when encountering rain
    }
}

void check_umbrella_availability(int availableUmbrellas, int umbrellaThreshold) {
    if (availableUmbrellas < umbrellaThreshold) {
        cerr << "Warning: Insufficient umbrellas for rainy segments!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int fatigue(int pos, int w) {
    if (pos == a) return 0;
    check_memoization_efficiency(pos, 500);  // Check memoization efficiency condition
    if (not memo[pos].empty()) {
        auto s = memo[pos].find(w);
        if (s != end(memo[pos])) return s->second;
    }
    int best = inf;
    if (umbrella[pos]) {
        check_umbrella_weight_and_distribution(pos, 50000);  // Check umbrella weight condition
        best = min(best, umbrella[pos] + fatigue(pos + 1, umbrella[pos]));
    }
    if (not w) {
        if (rain[pos] and not umbrella[pos]) return inf;
    } else {
        best = min(best, w + fatigue(pos + 1, w));
    }
    if (not rain[pos]) {
        check_path_decision_complexity(pos, 100);  // Check path decision complexity condition
        best = min(best, fatigue(pos + 1, 0));
    }
    memo[pos][w] = best;
    return best;
}

void solve() {
    cin >> a >> n >> m;
    memo.resize(a + 1);
    rain.resize(a + 1);
    umbrella.resize(a + 1, inf);

    int l, r;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        cin >> l >> r;
        for (int j = l; j < r; ++j) {
            rain[j] = 1;
        }
    }

    int x, p;
    int availableUmbrellas = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
        cin >> x >> p;
        umbrella[x] = min(p, umbrella[x]);
        availableUmbrellas++;
    }

    check_umbrella_availability(availableUmbrellas, 1);  // Check umbrella availability condition

    int best = fatigue(0, 0);
    cout << (best < inf ? best : -1) << "\n";
}

int main() {
    ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(0);
    solve();
    return 0;
}
```

### Comments on Instrumentation

- **Memoization Efficiency Check:** This is placed within the `fatigue` function right after checking if `pos == a`, to ensure we're not exploring too many states.
- **Umbrella Weight Check:** This is placed when considering picking up an umbrella at the current position.
- **Path Decision Complexity Check:** This is placed before deciding to move without an umbrella in non-rainy segments.
- **Umbrella Availability Check:** This is placed after reading input to ensure there are enough umbrellas for the rainy segments. 

These checks are designed to help identify potential performance bottlenecks in various scenarios without affecting the core logic flow.
