system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

Polycarp lives on a coordinate line at the point x = 0. He goes to his friend that lives at the point x = a. Polycarp can move only from left to right, he can pass one unit of length each second.

Now it's raining, so some segments of his way are in the rain. Formally, it's raining on n non-intersecting segments, the i-th segment which is in the rain is represented as [l_i, r_i] (0 ≤ l_i < r_i ≤ a).

There are m umbrellas lying on the line, the i-th umbrella is located at point x_i (0 ≤ x_i ≤ a) and has weight p_i. When Polycarp begins his journey, he doesn't have any umbrellas.

During his journey from x = 0 to x = a Polycarp can pick up and throw away umbrellas. Polycarp picks up and throws down any umbrella instantly. He can carry any number of umbrellas at any moment of time. Because Polycarp doesn't want to get wet, he must carry at least one umbrella while he moves from x to x + 1 if a segment [x, x + 1] is in the rain (i.e. if there exists some i such that l_i ≤ x and x + 1 ≤ r_i).

The condition above is the only requirement. For example, it is possible to go without any umbrellas to a point where some rain segment starts, pick up an umbrella at this point and move along with an umbrella. Polycarp can swap umbrellas while he is in the rain.

Each unit of length passed increases Polycarp's fatigue by the sum of the weights of umbrellas he carries while moving.

Can Polycarp make his way from point x = 0 to point x = a? If yes, find the minimum total fatigue after reaching x = a, if Polycarp picks up and throws away umbrellas optimally.

Input

The first line contains three integers a, n and m (1 ≤ a, m ≤ 2000, 1 ≤ n ≤ ⌈a/2⌉) — the point at which Polycarp's friend lives, the number of the segments in the rain and the number of umbrellas.

Each of the next n lines contains two integers l_i and r_i (0 ≤ l_i < r_i ≤ a) — the borders of the i-th segment under rain. It is guaranteed that there is no pair of intersecting segments. In other words, for each pair of segments i and j either r_i < l_j or r_j < l_i.

Each of the next m lines contains two integers x_i and p_i (0 ≤ x_i ≤ a, 1 ≤ p_i ≤ 10^5) — the location and the weight of the i-th umbrella.

Output

Print "-1" (without quotes) if Polycarp can't make his way from point x = 0 to point x = a. Otherwise print one integer — the minimum total fatigue after reaching x = a, if Polycarp picks up and throws away umbrellas optimally.

Note

In the first example the only possible strategy is to take the fourth umbrella at the point x = 1, keep it till the point x = 7 (the total fatigue at x = 7 will be equal to 12), throw it away, move on from x = 7 to x = 8 without an umbrella, take the third umbrella at x = 8 and keep it till the end (the total fatigue at x = 10 will be equal to 14). 

In the second example the only possible strategy is to take the first umbrella, move with it till the point x = 9, throw it away and proceed without an umbrella till the end.

assistant: To identify performance bottlenecks in the provided C code, we will analyze the hit count differences for the slow and fast inputs and derive performance-characterizing invariants in natural language.

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

By comparing the hit counts for the slow and fast inputs:

1. **Recursive Function `fun`:** 
   - The function `fun` is called significantly more times in the slow run (4595 times) compared to the fast run (646 times). This suggests that the recursion depth or branching is higher for the slow input.
   - Key lines in the `fun` function (lines 17-28) show significantly higher hit counts during the slow input, especially for the recursive calls on line 23 and line 26.

2. **Conditions in `fun`:**
   - The condition on line 22, which checks the status of `present` and `mark[pos]`, seems to be driving the control flow into recursive calls more frequently during the slow run.
   - Lines 23-26 contain recursive calls with different parameters that are executed more often in the slow run.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the hit count analysis and understanding of the program, the following performance-characterizing invariants can be derived:

1. **High Recursion Depth and Branching in Recursive Function:**
   - Natural Language Description: "If the recursion explores many branches, particularly when the path of the journey includes many rain segments with gaps requiring frequent umbrella switches, the computation may become costly due to repeated evaluations of overlapping subproblems."

2. **Complexity Due to Rain Segments and Umbrella Distribution:**
   - Natural Language Description: "When rain segments are densely packed or umbrella positions necessitate frequent picking up and dropping of umbrellas, the recursive exploration of potential paths increases, leading to slower execution."

3. **Impact of Umbrella Weights and Their Distribution:**
   - Natural Language Description: "If the distribution of umbrellas results in many low-weight umbrellas being involved over larger distances, or if the umbrella weights drastically affect the decision path at every step, the function may take longer to evaluate all possibilities."

These invariants highlight scenarios where the recursive function's complexity increases significantly, leading to potential slowdowns for specific input patterns, such as dense rain segments or umbrellas requiring optimal carrying strategies.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
Polycarp lives on a coordinate line at the point x = 0. He goes to his friend that lives at the point x = a. Polycarp can move only from left to right, he can pass one unit of length each second.

Now it's raining, so some segments of his way are in the rain. Formally, it's raining on n non-intersecting segments, the i-th segment which is in the rain is represented as [l_i, r_i] (0 ≤ l_i < r_i ≤ a).

There are m umbrellas lying on the line, the i-th umbrella is located at point x_i (0 ≤ x_i ≤ a) and has weight p_i. When Polycarp begins his journey, he doesn't have any umbrellas.

During his journey from x = 0 to x = a Polycarp can pick up and throw away umbrellas. Polycarp picks up and throws down any umbrella instantly. He can carry any number of umbrellas at any moment of time. Because Polycarp doesn't want to get wet, he must carry at least one umbrella while he moves from x to x + 1 if a segment [x, x + 1] is in the rain (i.e. if there exists some i such that l_i ≤ x and x + 1 ≤ r_i).

The condition above is the only requirement. For example, it is possible to go without any umbrellas to a point where some rain segment starts, pick up an umbrella at this point and move along with an umbrella. Polycarp can swap umbrellas while he is in the rain.

Each unit of length passed increases Polycarp's fatigue by the sum of the weights of umbrellas he carries while moving.

Can Polycarp make his way from point x = 0 to point x = a? If yes, find the minimum total fatigue after reaching x = a, if Polycarp picks up and throws away umbrellas optimally.

Input

The first line contains three integers a, n and m (1 ≤ a, m ≤ 2000, 1 ≤ n ≤ ⌈a/2⌉) — the point at which Polycarp's friend lives, the number of the segments in the rain and the number of umbrellas.

Each of the next n lines contains two integers l_i and r_i (0 ≤ l_i < r_i ≤ a) — the borders of the i-th segment under rain. It is guaranteed that there is no pair of intersecting segments. In other words, for each pair of segments i and j either r_i < l_j or r_j < l_i.

Each of the next m lines contains two integers x_i and p_i (0 ≤ x_i ≤ a, 1 ≤ p_i ≤ 10^5) — the location and the weight of the i-th umbrella.

Output

Print "-1" (without quotes) if Polycarp can't make his way from point x = 0 to point x = a. Otherwise print one integer — the minimum total fatigue after reaching x = a, if Polycarp picks up and throws away umbrellas optimally.

Output

Note

In the first example the only possible strategy is to take the fourth umbrella at the point x = 1, keep it till the point x = 7 (the total fatigue at x = 7 will be equal to 12), throw it away, move on from x = 7 to x = 8 without an umbrella, take the third umbrella at x = 8 and keep it till the end (the total fatigue at x = 10 will be equal to 14). 

In the second example the only possible strategy is to take the first umbrella, move with it till the point x = 9, throw it away and proceed without an umbrella till the end.

assistant: ### Phase 3: Implementing Performance-Characterizing Invariants in C++

Here, we will translate the natural language invariants derived earlier into runtime checks in C++. Each check will be implemented as a helper function.

#### Invariant Checks

1. **High Recursion Depth and Branching:**
   - This check will be applied based on the recursion depth and branching factor during the execution of the recursive function.
   
2. **Complexity Due to Rain Segments and Umbrella Distribution:**
   - This check will focus on the distribution of rain segments and umbrellas, ensuring that the problem complexity doesn't exceed certain thresholds.

3. **Impact of Umbrella Weights and Their Distribution:**
   - This check will verify if the weight distribution of umbrellas leads to excessive fatigue calculations.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <limits.h>

using namespace std;

void check_recursion_invariant(int recursionDepth, int maxAllowedDepth) {
    if (recursionDepth > maxAllowedDepth) {
        cerr << "Warning: Recursion depth invariant triggered - excessive recursion depth" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_rain_segment_invariant(int rainSegmentCount, int maxAllowedSegments) {
    if (rainSegmentCount > maxAllowedSegments) {
        cerr << "Warning: Rain segment invariant triggered - too many rain segments" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_umbrella_weight_invariant(int umbrellaWeight, int maxAllowedWeight) {
    if (umbrellaWeight > maxAllowedWeight) {
        cerr << "Warning: Umbrella weight invariant triggered - excessive umbrella weight" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

```

### Phase 4: Integrating Checks into the Existing Program

We'll now incorporate these checks into the original C++ solution by strategically placing them to monitor performance bottlenecks without affecting the runtime in tight loops.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
const int N = 2005, inf = 1e9;
int mark[N], val[N];
int a, n, m;
int dp[2][N][N];

void check_recursion_invariant(int recursionDepth, int maxAllowedDepth) {
    if (recursionDepth > maxAllowedDepth) {
        cerr << "Warning: Recursion depth invariant triggered - excessive recursion depth" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_rain_segment_invariant(int rainSegmentCount, int maxAllowedSegments) {
    if (rainSegmentCount > maxAllowedSegments) {
        cerr << "Warning: Rain segment invariant triggered - too many rain segments" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_umbrella_weight_invariant(int umbrellaWeight, int maxAllowedWeight) {
    if (umbrellaWeight > maxAllowedWeight) {
        cerr << "Warning: Umbrella weight invariant triggered - excessive umbrella weight" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int fun(int pos, int ind, bool present, int depth) {
    check_recursion_invariant(depth, 100); // Check for excessive recursion depth
    if (pos == a + 1) return 0;
    if (dp[present][pos][ind] != -1) return dp[present][pos][ind];
    int ans = inf;
    int newind = ((val[pos] < val[ind]) ? pos : ind);
    if ((present && mark[pos] == -1) || (!present && !mark[pos]))
        ans = min(fun(pos + 1, a + 1, false, depth + 1),
                  val[newind] + fun(pos + 1, newind, false, depth + 1));
    else if (present || mark[pos] == 1)
        ans = val[newind] + fun(pos + 1, newind, true, depth + 1);
    ans = min(ans, inf);
    return dp[present][pos][ind] = ans;
}

int main() {
    ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);
    cout.tie(NULL);
    memset(dp, -1, sizeof(dp));
    cin >> a >> n >> m;

    // Check for excessive rain segments
    check_rain_segment_invariant(n, a / 2);

    for (int i = 1; i < n + 1; i++) {
        int x, y;
        cin >> x >> y;
        mark[x] = 1;
        mark[y] = -1;
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < a + 2; i++) val[i] = inf;
    for (int i = 1; i < m + 1; i++) {
        int x, y;
        cin >> x >> y;
        // Check for excessive umbrella weight
        check_umbrella_weight_invariant(y, 100000);
        val[x] = min(val[x], y);
    }
    int ans = fun(0, a + 1, 0, 0);
    if (ans >= inf) ans = -1;
    cout << ans << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

- **Recursion Check:** The `check_recursion_invariant` is placed in the `fun` recursive function to abort if the depth exceeds a certain threshold.
- **Rain Segment Check:** The `check_rain_segment_invariant` is placed after reading the number of rain segments to prevent excessive segment handling.
- **Umbrella Weight Check:** The `check_umbrella_weight_invariant` is placed while reading umbrella weights to ensure no excessive weights cause performance degradation.

By integrating these checks, we can proactively detect potential performance bottlenecks without impacting normal program execution significantly.
