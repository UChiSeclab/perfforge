system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

Vasya commutes by train every day. There are n train stations in the city, and at the i-th station it's possible to buy only tickets to stations from i + 1 to ai inclusive. No tickets are sold at the last station.

Let ρi, j be the minimum number of tickets one needs to buy in order to get from stations i to station j. As Vasya is fond of different useless statistic he asks you to compute the sum of all values ρi, j among all pairs 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100 000) — the number of stations.

The second line contains n - 1 integer ai (i + 1 ≤ ai ≤ n), the i-th of them means that at the i-th station one may buy tickets to each station from i + 1 to ai inclusive.

Output

Print the sum of ρi, j among all pairs of 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n.

Examples

4 4 4


Output

Output

17

Note

In the first sample it's possible to get from any station to any other (with greater index) using only one ticket. The total number of pairs is 6, so the answer is also 6.

Consider the second sample: 

  * ρ1, 2 = 1
  * ρ1, 3 = 2
  * ρ1, 4 = 3
  * ρ1, 5 = 3
  * ρ2, 3 = 1
  * ρ2, 4 = 2
  * ρ2, 5 = 2
  * ρ3, 4 = 1
  * ρ3, 5 = 1
  * ρ4, 5 = 1



Thus the answer equals 1 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 17.

assistant: To analyze the performance bottleneck in the provided C code, let's go through the hit count data and identify the expensive code segments, then derive performance-characterizing invariants.

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Hit Count Comparison:**
   - The lines that differ significantly in hit counts between the slow and fast inputs are lines related to the loop and Sparse Table (RMQ) operations.
   - Notably, lines 30-32 are hit significantly more often in the slow input (299,992 vs 199,998), indicating a performance bottleneck in the Sparse Table construction.
   - Similarly, lines 35-39, which are involved in computing the minimum tickets using dynamic programming and RMQ in reverse order, show increased hits in the slow input.

2. **Potential Causes of Slowdown:**
   - The code uses a Sparse Table for range maximum queries, which involves preprocessing and querying steps. This structure is efficient for static range queries but can still be bulky if not managed carefully.
   - The nested loop in lines 30-32, which constructs the Sparse Table, increases hit counts linearly with `n` and exponentially with the logarithm of `n`, especially if the table is not well optimized for the specific input.

3. **Data Structure Interaction:**
   - The Sparse Table (`spt`) and dynamic programming array (`dp`) interact such that querying for maximum values across ranges of the array `a` becomes computationally expensive if the ranges are not minimized appropriately.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the analysis, we can derive the following performance-characterizing invariants:

1. **Sparse Table Construction Complexity:**
   - **Invariant:** "When the number of stations `n` is large, and a broader range of ticket options `a[i]` are available, the preprocessing step for constructing Sparse Table can become expensive."
   - **Situation:** This occurs because the preprocessing involves nested loops that scale with both the size of the input and its logarithm, leading to high overhead when these parameters grow.

2. **Dynamic Programming with Sparse Table Queries:**
   - **Invariant:** "If the array `a` has large values relative to their indices, leading to wide `RMQ` query ranges, the dynamic programming calculation (`dp[i]`) may require processing large subarrays, thereby increasing computation time."
   - **Situation:** The program needs to compute minimum tickets for a range using precomputed Sparse Table, which can be time-consuming if the range is too large.

3. **Loop Iteration for Dynamic Range Queries:**
   - **Invariant:** "If the ticket options (`a[i]`) result in deep recursion or extensive range queries, the accumulation of processing time in iterative calculations may cause slowdowns."
   - **Situation:** This happens in the backward loop where each station computes its `dp` value based on results that involve querying potentially large segments of the array.

### Conclusion

The slow performance is primarily attributed to inefficient handling of larger-than-necessary range queries and preprocessing overhead in the Sparse Table construction. Improving efficiency would require optimizing the Sparse Table handling or re-evaluating the approach to minimize unnecessary computations in large subarrays.

These characterizations should aid in pinpointing potential slowdowns for similar future inputs and guide optimizations in the algorithm's computational approach.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
Vasya commutes by train every day. There are n train stations in the city, and at the i-th station it's possible to buy only tickets to stations from i + 1 to ai inclusive. No tickets are sold at the last station.

Let ρi, j be the minimum number of tickets one needs to buy in order to get from stations i to station j. As Vasya is fond of different useless statistic he asks you to compute the sum of all values ρi, j among all pairs 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100 000) — the number of stations.

The second line contains n - 1 integer ai (i + 1 ≤ ai ≤ n), the i-th of them means that at the i-th station one may buy tickets to each station from i + 1 to ai inclusive.

Output

Print the sum of ρi, j among all pairs of 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n.

Examples

Input

4
4 4 4


Output

6


Input

5
2 3 5 5


Output

17

Note

In the first sample it's possible to get from any station to any other (with greater index) using only one ticket. The total number of pairs is 6, so the answer is also 6.

Consider the second sample: 

  * ρ1, 2 = 1
  * ρ1, 3 = 2
  * ρ1, 4 = 3
  * ρ1, 5 = 3
  * ρ2, 3 = 1
  * ρ2, 4 = 2
  * ρ2, 5 = 2
  * ρ3, 4 = 1
  * ρ3, 5 = 1
  * ρ4, 5 = 1



Thus the answer equals 1 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 17.

assistant: ## Phase 3: Implementing Invariant Checkers in C++

Here are the checker functions based on the natural language invariants derived earlier:

1. **Sparse Table Construction Complexity Checker:**

   This checks if the preprocessing step for the Sparse Table may become expensive due to large `n` and widespread range values in `a`.

   ```cpp
   void check_sparse_table_invariant(int n, const int *a) {
       bool condition = false;
       for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
           if ((a[i] - i) > (n / 2)) {  // Example condition: wide range relative to index
               condition = true;
               break;
           }
       }
       if (condition) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered in Sparse Table construction!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Dynamic Programming Range Query Complexity Checker:**

   This checks if the dynamic programming step involves excessively large range queries, potentially due to large values relative to indices.

   ```cpp
   void check_dp_range_query_invariant(int n, const int *a) {
       bool condition = false;
       for (int i = n - 1; i >= 1; --i) {
           if (a[i] - i > (n / 3)) {  // Example condition: large query ranges
               condition = true;
               break;
           }
       }
       if (condition) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered in Dynamic Programming range queries!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Loop Iteration for Extensive Range Queries Checker:**

   This checks if extensive range queries lead to excessive processing time, particularly in the backward loop.

   ```cpp
   void check_loop_range_query_invariant(int n, const int *a) {
       bool condition = false;
       for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
           if (a[i] == n) {  // Example condition: queries covering almost all stations
               condition = true;
               break;
           }
       }
       if (condition) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered in extensive range queries!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

## Phase 4: Integrating Checkers into the Original C++ Program

Now, integrate these checker functions into the original program at appropriate points to ensure they are effective without incurring unnecessary overhead.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
const int MAXN = 100002;
const int LOG = 18;
int a[MAXN];
long long dp[MAXN];
pair<long long, int> spt[MAXN][LOG];
int lg[MAXN];
int n;

void fast_io() {
    ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);
}

pair<long long, int> RMQ(int lx, int rx) {
    int j = lg[rx - lx + 1];
    return max(spt[lx][j], spt[rx - (1 << j) + 1][j]);
}

// Invariant checkers
void check_sparse_table_invariant(int n, const int *a) {
    bool condition = false;
    for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
        if ((a[i] - i) > (n / 2)) {  // Example condition: wide range relative to index
            condition = true;
            break;
        }
    }
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered in Sparse Table construction!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_dp_range_query_invariant(int n, const int *a) {
    bool condition = false;
    for (int i = n - 1; i >= 1; --i) {
        if (a[i] - i > (n / 3)) {  // Example condition: large query ranges
            condition = true;
            break;
        }
    }
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered in Dynamic Programming range queries!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_loop_range_query_invariant(int n, const int *a) {
    bool condition = false;
    for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
        if (a[i] == n) {  // Example condition: queries covering almost all stations
            condition = true;
            break;
        }
    }
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered in extensive range queries!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    fast_io();
    cin >> n;
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        cin >> a[i];
    }

    // Insert invariant checks after reading input
    check_sparse_table_invariant(n, a);
    check_dp_range_query_invariant(n, a);
    check_loop_range_query_invariant(n, a);

    for (int i = 2; i < MAXN; i++) {
        lg[i] = 1 + lg[i >> 1];
    }
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        spt[i][0] = make_pair(a[i], -i);
    }
    for (int j = 1; j <= lg[n]; j++) {
        for (int i = 1; i + (1 << j) < MAXN; i++)
            spt[i][j] = max(spt[i][j - 1], spt[i + (1 << (j - 1))][j - 1]);
    }
    long long ans = 0;
    for (int i = n - 1; i >= 1; i--) {
        pair<long long, int> q = RMQ(i + 1, a[i]);
        q.second *= -1;
        dp[i] = (n + q.second) - (a[i] + i) + dp[q.second];
        ans += dp[i];
    }
    printf("%lld\n", ans);
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of Integration

- **After Input Reading:** The invariant checks are placed after reading the input values and before any complex preprocessing or computation starts. This ensures that any potentially problematic input configurations are caught early.
- **Avoiding Overhead:** Since these checks are outside of any tight loops, they introduce minimal performance overhead while providing valuable insight into potential performance bottlenecks.
