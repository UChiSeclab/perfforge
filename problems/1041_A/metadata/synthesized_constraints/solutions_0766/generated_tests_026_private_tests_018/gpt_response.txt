### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

By comparing the hit counts of the slow and fast inputs, we can pinpoint where inefficiencies arise:

1. **Line 9: `for (int i = el[0]; i <= el[n - 1]; i++)`**
   - This line is hit 99,999,994 times in the slow input and only 4 times in the fast input.
   - The loop iterates over a range defined by the smallest and largest elements of the sorted array `el`.
   - For the slow input, `el[0]` is 10 and `el[n-1]` is 100,000,002, leading to a large iteration range.
   - For the fast input, `el[0]` and `el[n-1]` are close, resulting in fewer iterations.

2. **Line 10: `if (el[j] != i)`**
   - This line is hit 99,999,993 times with the slow input and 3 times with the fast input.
   - This condition checks if the current index `i` exists in the array `el`. If not, it increments the stolen count `ans`.

3. **Line 11: `ans++`**
   - This line is executed 99,999,990 times for the slow input, indicating many increments of the theft count.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the analysis, the slow path is predominantly due to the huge iteration range of the loop. The following invariants describe the conditions under which this slowdown is likely to occur:

1. **Invariant 1: Large Range Iteration**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "If the difference between the maximum and minimum indices of the remaining keyboards is large, the loop iterating over this range can become a bottleneck."
   - **Threshold Suggestion:** The iteration range (`el[n-1] - el[0]`) is significantly large relative to `n`, which implies a broad range to search for stolen keyboards.

2. **Invariant 2: Sparse Distribution of Indices**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "When the indices of the remaining keyboards are sparsely distributed, the program performs more checks to find missing indices, increasing execution time."
   - **Threshold Suggestion:** If the average gap between the indices of consecutive keyboards is much larger than 1 (i.e., `(el[n-1] - el[0]) / n` is large), it may indicate sparsity.

3. **Invariant 3: High Inefficiency Due to Linear Search**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "The linear search for missing indices between the minimum and maximum values of the remaining keyboards causes inefficiency when this range is significantly larger than the number of keyboards."
   - **Threshold Suggestion:** A large range combined with relatively small `n` leads to inefficient execution, as seen by excessive loop iterations compared to the input size.

These invariants abstract the conditions leading to the slowdown, focusing on the relationship between input data distribution and algorithmic inefficiency, without relying on specific numeric values from the slow input.

### Phase 3: Implementing Natural Language Invariants in C++

Let's transform the previously derived performance-characterizing invariants into runtime checks in C++:

1. **Invariant 1: Large Range Iteration**
   ```cpp
   void check_large_range_invariant(int minIndex, int maxIndex, int n) {
       if ((maxIndex - minIndex) > 10 * n) { // Arbitrary threshold relative to n
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large range iteration!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Invariant 2: Sparse Distribution of Indices**
   ```cpp
   void check_sparse_distribution_invariant(int minIndex, int maxIndex, int n) {
       if ((maxIndex - minIndex) / n > 10) { // Arbitrary threshold indicating sparsity
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - sparse distribution of indices!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Invariant 3: High Inefficiency Due to Linear Search**
   ```cpp
   void check_linear_search_invariant(int minIndex, int maxIndex, int n) {
       if ((maxIndex - minIndex) > 100 * n) { // Threshold derived from inefficiency due to large range
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - linear search inefficiency!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Integrating Checkers into the Original C++ Program

Now, let's integrate these checks into the given C++ program.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int n, el[1001];

void check_large_range_invariant(int minIndex, int maxIndex, int n) {
    if ((maxIndex - minIndex) > 10 * n) { // Arbitrary threshold relative to n
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large range iteration!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_sparse_distribution_invariant(int minIndex, int maxIndex, int n) {
    if ((maxIndex - minIndex) / n > 10) { // Arbitrary threshold indicating sparsity
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - sparse distribution of indices!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_linear_search_invariant(int minIndex, int maxIndex, int n) {
    if ((maxIndex - minIndex) > 100 * n) { // Threshold derived from inefficiency due to large range
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - linear search inefficiency!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    cin >> n;
    for (int i = 0; i < (int)n; ++i) cin >> el[i];
    sort(el, el + n);

    int minIndex = el[0];
    int maxIndex = el[n - 1];

    // Perform checks after sorting and before the loop
    check_large_range_invariant(minIndex, maxIndex, n);
    check_sparse_distribution_invariant(minIndex, maxIndex, n);
    check_linear_search_invariant(minIndex, maxIndex, n);

    int j = 0, ans = 0;
    for (int i = minIndex; i <= maxIndex; i++) {
        if (el[j] != i) {
            ans++;
        } else {
            j++;
        }
    }
    cout << ans << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Invariant 1 Check**: Placed after sorting, it checks if the range is large relative to `n`, indicating potential bottleneck.
- **Invariant 2 Check**: Evaluates the average gap between indices to detect sparse distribution.
- **Invariant 3 Check**: Detects inefficiency due to a large range for linear search.

These checks ensure that the program warns about potential performance bottlenecks, helping identify inputs that may cause slow execution. Each check is positioned to avoid overhead in the main loop, ensuring minimal impact on performance.
