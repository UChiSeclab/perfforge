### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

**Key Observations:**

1. **Line-Level Hit Count Comparison:**
   - The loop starting at line 10 is hit 99,999,994 times in the slow input but only 4 times in the fast input. This indicates that the loop is being iterated significantly more times when handling the slow input.
   - The condition `if (i == a[t])` at line 11 is checked 99,999,993 times for the slow input.
   - The branch `d++` at line 14 is executed 99,999,990 times for the slow input, compared to not being executed for the fast input.

2. **Inefficient Loop:**
   - The loop `for (int i = a[0]; i <= a[n - 1]; i++)` iterates over a large range of indices when there is a significant gap between `a[0]` and `a[n-1]`.
   - The loop's inefficiency arises because it iterates over all integers between the smallest and largest index found in the list, without efficient skipping or direct calculation.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

**Invariant Statements:**

1. **Large Range Between Minimum and Maximum:**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "If the difference between the smallest and largest remaining keyboard index is very large compared to the number of keyboards `n`, the program may iterate over a huge range, significantly slowing down the computation."
   - **Implementation Suggestion:** Monitor if `a[n-1] - a[0]` is significantly larger than `n`. For example, if `(a[n-1] - a[0]) > 1000 * n` (an arbitrary multiplier to capture large gaps relevant to typical input constraints).

2. **Sparse Distribution of Indices:**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "When the remaining indices are sparsely distributed across a wide range, as opposed to being dense or contiguous, the loop will perform many unnecessary iterations over missing indices, slowing down the program."
   - **Implementation Suggestion:** Check the density of indices: calculate the ratio of `n` to the range `(a[n-1] - a[0])` and if significantly less than 1, this indicates sparseness.

3. **Potential for Large Iteration Count with Small `n`:**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "For inputs where `n` is small but the indices cover a wide range, the discrepancy between the number of iterations and the actual useful operations could cause the program to run slowly."
   - **Implementation Suggestion:** Use an invariant that detects scenarios where `n` is a small fraction of the range, like `n < (a[n-1] - a[0]) / 1000`.

By applying these invariants, you can identify and potentially refactor code paths or input scenarios where the performance becomes problematic. These statements aim to abstract the specific conditions causing the slowdown while adhering to the problem's constraints.

### Phase 3: Implementing Performance-Characterizing Invariants in C++

Below are the C++ code snippets implementing the performance-characterizing invariants derived in Phase 2:

1. **Large Range Between Minimum and Maximum:**

```cpp
void check_large_range_invariant(int minIndex, int maxIndex, int n) {
    if ((maxIndex - minIndex) > 1000 * n) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large range between indices!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

2. **Sparse Distribution of Indices:**

```cpp
void check_sparse_distribution_invariant(int minIndex, int maxIndex, int n) {
    if (n < (maxIndex - minIndex) / 1000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - sparse distribution of indices!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

3. **Potential for Large Iteration Count with Small `n`:**

```cpp
void check_large_iteration_invariant(int minIndex, int maxIndex, int n) {
    if (n < (maxIndex - minIndex) / 1000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large iteration count with small n!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrating Checkers into the Original Program

Here is the original C++ code with the integrated performance-invariant checks:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Phase 3: Invariant checkers
void check_large_range_invariant(int minIndex, int maxIndex, int n) {
    if ((maxIndex - minIndex) > 1000 * n) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large range between indices!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_sparse_distribution_invariant(int minIndex, int maxIndex, int n) {
    if (n < (maxIndex - minIndex) / 1000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - sparse distribution of indices!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_large_iteration_invariant(int minIndex, int maxIndex, int n) {
    if (n < (maxIndex - minIndex) / 1000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large iteration count with small n!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    vector<int> a(n);
    for (auto &x : a) cin >> x;
    sort(a.begin(), a.end());
  
    int minIndex = a[0];
    int maxIndex = a[n - 1];

    // Phase 4: Invoking invariant checkers
    check_large_range_invariant(minIndex, maxIndex, n);
    check_sparse_distribution_invariant(minIndex, maxIndex, n);
    check_large_iteration_invariant(minIndex, maxIndex, n);

    int t = 0, d = 0;
    for (int i = minIndex; i <= maxIndex; i++) {
        if (i == a[t])
            t++;
        else
            d++;
    }
    cout << d << endl;
}
```

**Explanation:**

- **Check Placement:** The checks are placed after sorting the array, as this guarantees `minIndex` and `maxIndex` are correctly identified. This is before entering the loop that evaluates missing indices, ensuring minimal overhead in terms of performance, as they are outside the loop.
- **Invariant Implementation:** Each invariant check uses the conditions derived in Phase 2, aiming to capture potential performance issues based on the input characteristics.
- **Warnings and Aborts:** Each check outputs a warning and calls `abort()` to prevent the program from continuing, simulating a fuzzer's detection of these bottleneck conditions.
