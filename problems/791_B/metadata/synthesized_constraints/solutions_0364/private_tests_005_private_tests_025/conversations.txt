system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

Bear Limak examines a social network. Its main functionality is that two members can become friends (then they can talk with each other and share funny pictures).

There are n members, numbered 1 through n. m pairs of members are friends. Of course, a member can't be a friend with themselves.

Let A-B denote that members A and B are friends. Limak thinks that a network is reasonable if and only if the following condition is satisfied: For every three distinct members (X, Y, Z), if X-Y and Y-Z then also X-Z.

For example: if Alan and Bob are friends, and Bob and Ciri are friends, then Alan and Ciri should be friends as well.

Can you help Limak and check if the network is reasonable? Print "YES" or "NO" accordingly, without the quotes.

Input

The first line of the input contain two integers n and m (3 ≤ n ≤ 150 000, <image>) — the number of members and the number of pairs of members that are friends.

The i-th of the next m lines contains two distinct integers ai and bi (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n, ai ≠ bi). Members ai and bi are friends with each other. No pair of members will appear more than once in the input.

Output

If the given network is reasonable, print "YES" in a single line (without the quotes). Otherwise, print "NO" in a single line (without the quotes).

The answer is "NO" in the second sample because members (2, 3) are friends and members (3, 4) are friends, while members (2, 4) are not.

assistant: To diagnose the performance bottleneck in the given C program, we start by analyzing the provided hit counts from both the slow and fast inputs. Our goal is to understand why the slow input takes significantly more time despite having a similar structure to the fast input.

### Phase 1: Identifying Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Line-level Hit Count Analysis:**
   
   - The line `for (i = 1; i <= n; i++)` in the main loop is executed 150,001 times with the slow input, in contrast to just 4 times with the fast input.
   - The `dfs` function is called 150,000 times for the slow input and only 3 times for the fast input.
   - Inside the `dfs` function, the `while (!stack.empty())` loop runs 300,000 times for the slow input and 6 times for the fast input.

2. **Inference:**

   - The primary inefficiency arises from the repeated calls to the `dfs` function, especially given that each call involves a potentially extensive traversal due to the stack-based approach.
   - The slowdown primarily results from the scenario where there are no connections (friend pairs) between nodes, leading the algorithm to perform a depth-first search from each isolated node.

### Phase 2: Deriving Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the analysis, here are the performance-characterizing invariants describing conditions under which the code slows down:

1. **Invariant 1: High Node Count with No Connections**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "If the network has a high number of members but very few or no connections (friend pairs), the program may slow down significantly as it processes each node individually without benefit from grouping nodes into connected components."
   - **Rationale:** When `m` (the number of friend pairs) is zero or very low compared to `n` (the number of members), the program inefficiently executes a DFS for each node since there are no connections to reduce the number of components.

2. **Invariant 2: Repeated Isolated Node Processing**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "If many nodes in the network are isolated (having no friends), the depth-first search mechanism must process each of these nodes separately, leading to a performance bottleneck."
   - **Rationale:** Isolated nodes cause the DFS algorithm to restart for each node, rather than traversing connected subgraphs.

3. **Invariant 3: Inefficient Handling of Sparse Graphs**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "Sparse graphs, where the number of connections is much lower than the number of nodes, may cause the algorithm to behave inefficiently, handling each node as a separate subproblem instead of optimizing for connectivity."
   - **Rationale:** In a sparse graph, the program does extra work by checking each node independently rather than leveraging connectivity within larger components.

These invariants help understand the scenarios leading to a slowdown, particularly focusing on the structural properties of the input graph (friendship connections) rather than on specific numeric values. The program is optimized for processing connected components but performs poorly when nodes are largely isolated.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
Bear Limak examines a social network. Its main functionality is that two members can become friends (then they can talk with each other and share funny pictures).

There are n members, numbered 1 through n. m pairs of members are friends. Of course, a member can't be a friend with themselves.

Let A-B denote that members A and B are friends. Limak thinks that a network is reasonable if and only if the following condition is satisfied: For every three distinct members (X, Y, Z), if X-Y and Y-Z then also X-Z.

For example: if Alan and Bob are friends, and Bob and Ciri are friends, then Alan and Ciri should be friends as well.

Can you help Limak and check if the network is reasonable? Print "YES" or "NO" accordingly, without the quotes.

Input

The first line of the input contain two integers n and m (3 ≤ n ≤ 150 000, <image>) — the number of members and the number of pairs of members that are friends.

The i-th of the next m lines contains two distinct integers ai and bi (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n, ai ≠ bi). Members ai and bi are friends with each other. No pair of members will appear more than once in the input.

Output

If the given network is reasonable, print "YES" in a single line (without the quotes). Otherwise, print "NO" in a single line (without the quotes).

assistant: To implement the performance-characterizing invariants as runtime checks in the C++ program, I'll follow the given template and integrate these checks into the program. Here's the step-by-step procedure, consisting of two phases:

### Phase 3: Implementing the Invariants as Checker Code

1. **Invariant 1: High Node Count with No Connections**
   - **Code:**
   ```cpp
   void check_high_node_no_connection(bool condition) {
       if (condition) {
           cerr << "Warning: High node count with no connections!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Invariant 2: Repeated Isolated Node Processing**
   - **Code:**
   ```cpp
   void check_isolated_nodes(bool condition) {
       if (condition) {
           cerr << "Warning: Many isolated nodes leading to expensive DFS calls!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Invariant 3: Inefficient Handling of Sparse Graphs**
   - **Code:**
   ```cpp
   void check_sparse_graph(bool condition) {
       if (condition) {
           cerr << "Warning: Sparse graph causing inefficient processing!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Integrating the Checker Code into the Program

Now, we'll integrate these checks into the provided C++ solution. We'll place these checks at strategic points to avoid unnecessary overhead and ensure they catch the potential performance issues effectively.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Checker for high node count with no connections
void check_high_node_no_connection(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: High node count with no connections!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Checker for repeated isolated node processing
void check_isolated_nodes(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Many isolated nodes leading to expensive DFS calls!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Checker for inefficient handling of sparse graphs
void check_sparse_graph(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Sparse graph causing inefficient processing!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void dfs(map<int, vector<int>> &mp, int &s, vector<bool> &visited, long long int &c2, long long int &count) {
    stack<int> stack;
    stack.push(s);
    while (!stack.empty()) {
        s = stack.top();
        stack.pop();
        if (!visited[s]) {
            c2++;
            count += mp[s].size();
            visited[s] = true;
            for (int i = 0; i < mp[s].size(); i++) {
                if (!visited[mp[s][i]]) stack.push(mp[s][i]);
            }
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);
    cout.tie(NULL);
    int i, n, m, j, x, y;
    scanf("%d%d", &n, &m);
    map<int, vector<int>> mp;
  
    for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        scanf("%d%d", &x, &y);
        mp[x].push_back(y);
        mp[y].push_back(x);
    }

    // Check for high node count with no connections
    check_high_node_no_connection(n > 100000 && m == 0);
  
    // Check for sparse graph situation
    check_sparse_graph(n > 100000 && m < n / 10);

    int f = 0;
    vector<bool> visited(n + 1, false);
    for (i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        if (!visited[i]) {
            long long int c2 = 0, count = 0;
            dfs(mp, i, visited, c2, count);
            if (count != (c2 * (c2 - 1))) {
                puts("NO");
                f = 1;
                break;
            }
        }
    }
    if (f == 0) {
        puts("YES");
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

- **High Node Count with No Connections:** This check is placed after reading the input to immediately catch cases where the network is large but has no connections.
  
- **Sparse Graph Condition:** This check is also placed after input reading to identify when the graph is significantly sparse, leading to inefficient processing.

- **Isolated Node Processing:** This invariant is implicitly covered by the first two conditions since they capture scenarios that lead to isolated node processing.

Each checker uses a condition that reflects the invariant it's meant to detect, and the `abort()` function is called if the condition is triggered, thus aiding in identifying performance bottlenecks during testing or fuzzing.
