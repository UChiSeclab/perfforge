system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

If the girl doesn't go to Denis, then Denis will go to the girl. Using this rule, the young man left home, bought flowers and went to Nastya. 

On the way from Denis's house to the girl's house is a road of n lines. This road can't be always crossed in one green light. Foreseeing this, the good mayor decided to place safety islands in some parts of the road. Each safety island is located after a line, as well as at the beginning and at the end of the road. Pedestrians can relax on them, gain strength and wait for a green light.

Denis came to the edge of the road exactly at the moment when the green light turned on. The boy knows that the traffic light first lights up g seconds green, and then r seconds red, then again g seconds green and so on.

Formally, the road can be represented as a segment [0, n]. Initially, Denis is at point 0. His task is to get to point n in the shortest possible time.

He knows many different integers d_1, d_2, …, d_m, where 0 ≤ d_i ≤ n — are the coordinates of points, in which the safety islands are located. Only at one of these points, the boy can be at a time when the red light is on.

Unfortunately, Denis isn't always able to control himself because of the excitement, so some restrictions are imposed:

  * He must always move while the green light is on because it's difficult to stand when so beautiful girl is waiting for you. Denis can change his position by ± 1 in 1 second. While doing so, he must always stay inside the segment [0, n]. 
  * He can change his direction only on the safety islands (because it is safe). This means that if in the previous second the boy changed his position by +1 and he walked on a safety island, then he can change his position by ± 1. Otherwise, he can change his position only by +1. Similarly, if in the previous second he changed his position by -1, on a safety island he can change position by ± 1, and at any other point by -1. 
  * At the moment when the red light is on, the boy must be on one of the safety islands. He can continue moving in any direction when the green light is on. 



Denis has crossed the road as soon as his coordinate becomes equal to n.

This task was not so simple, because it's possible that it is impossible to cross the road. Since Denis has all thoughts about his love, he couldn't solve this problem and asked us to help him. Find the minimal possible time for which he can cross the road according to these rules, or find that it is impossible to do.

Input

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, 2 ≤ m ≤ min(n + 1, 10^4)) — road width and the number of safety islands.

The second line contains m distinct integers d_1, d_2, …, d_m (0 ≤ d_i ≤ n) — the points where the safety islands are located. It is guaranteed that there are 0 and n among them.

The third line contains two integers g, r (1 ≤ g, r ≤ 1000) — the time that the green light stays on and the time that the red light stays on.

Output

Output a single integer — the minimum time for which Denis can cross the road with obeying all the rules.

If it is impossible to cross the road output -1.

Examples

Input


15 5
0 3 7 14 15
11 11


Output


45

Input


13 4
0 3 7 13
9 9


Output


-1

Note

In the first test, the optimal route is: 

  * for the first green light, go to 7 and return to 3. In this case, we will change the direction of movement at the point 7, which is allowed, since there is a safety island at this point. In the end, we will be at the point of 3, where there is also a safety island. The next 11 seconds we have to wait for the red light. 
  * for the second green light reaches 14. Wait for the red light again. 
  * for 1 second go to 15. As a result, Denis is at the end of the road. 



In total, 45 seconds are obtained.

In the second test, it is impossible to cross the road according to all the rules.

assistant: To identify performance-characterizing invariants in the provided C code, let's analyze the slow and fast inputs, along with the line-level hit counts.

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

From the hit count data, we observe:

- **Lines 9, 30-50**: The loop that processes the queue and evaluates conditions is significantly more executed in the slow input compared to the fast input.
- **Function `check` (Lines 15-28)**: Called more frequently with the slow input. This function checks conditions related to the current position and updates the queue.
- **Lines 31-35**: Code handling the current position in the queue, specifically the search for the next point to process, is frequently executed in the slow input.
- **Line 26**: Represents where new positions are enqueued heavily in the slow scenario.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Given the analysis, the following invariants describe conditions under which the program is likely to enter a slow path:

1. **High Step Count to Reach Safety Island**:
   - **Invariant**: If Denis frequently approaches a safety island but has to turn back due to the red light, especially if the island count is sparse or distances between islands are large, the program experiences additional overhead.
   - **Description**: “When the distances between safety islands are large relative to `g`, Denis may reach maximum travel length without reaching an island, causing excessive turning and waiting.”

2. **Repetitive Queue Processing for Same Positions**:
   - **Invariant**: If the same positions or states are processed repeatedly, especially due to the need to revert or explore alternate paths frequently, this increases computational workload.
   - **Description**: “If Denis frequently revisits the same path positions due to lack of forward progress, excessive computation occurs. This is common when safety islands are poorly distributed or `g` is not optimal for the given distances.”

3. **Long Red Light Durations Relative to Path Dynamics**:
   - **Invariant**: Programs slow down significantly when the red light duration `r` causes repeated or prolonged waiting at safety islands, particularly if green light durations (`g`) do not allow Denis to make substantial progress towards the end.
   - **Description**: “Prolonged waiting periods occur when the red light duration `r` is much longer than the time it takes to reach the next safety island within `g` seconds, leading to compounded idle time.”

4. **Sparse Safety Islands with High `n`**:
   - **Invariant**: If the number of safety islands is low compared to the total road length `n`, Denis has fewer options to pause and change direction, which can lead to inefficient routes.
   - **Description**: “When safety islands are sparse across a wide road (large `n`), Denis may lack flexibility to optimize his path, leading to inefficiencies.”

These invariants highlight the scenarios where Denis's traversal is suboptimal due to constraints in safety island placement, green light duration, and excessive queue processing, thereby allowing for identification of bottlenecks without specific numeric reliance but adhering to problem constraints.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
If the girl doesn't go to Denis, then Denis will go to the girl. Using this rule, the young man left home, bought flowers and went to Nastya. 

On the way from Denis's house to the girl's house is a road of n lines. This road can't be always crossed in one green light. Foreseeing this, the good mayor decided to place safety islands in some parts of the road. Each safety island is located after a line, as well as at the beginning and at the end of the road. Pedestrians can relax on them, gain strength and wait for a green light.

Denis came to the edge of the road exactly at the moment when the green light turned on. The boy knows that the traffic light first lights up g seconds green, and then r seconds red, then again g seconds green and so on.

Formally, the road can be represented as a segment [0, n]. Initially, Denis is at point 0. His task is to get to point n in the shortest possible time.

He knows many different integers d_1, d_2, …, d_m, where 0 ≤ d_i ≤ n — are the coordinates of points, in which the safety islands are located. Only at one of these points, the boy can be at a time when the red light is on.

Unfortunately, Denis isn't always able to control himself because of the excitement, so some restrictions are imposed:

  * He must always move while the green light is on because it's difficult to stand when so beautiful girl is waiting for you. Denis can change his position by ± 1 in 1 second. While doing so, he must always stay inside the segment [0, n]. 
  * He can change his direction only on the safety islands (because it is safe). This means that if in the previous second the boy changed his position by +1 and he walked on a safety island, then he can change his position by ± 1. Otherwise, he can change his position only by +1. Similarly, if in the previous second he changed his position by -1, on a safety island he can change position by ± 1, and at any other point by -1. 
  * At the moment when the red light is on, the boy must be on one of the safety islands. He can continue moving in any direction when the green light is on. 



Denis has crossed the road as soon as his coordinate becomes equal to n.

This task was not so simple, because it's possible that it is impossible to cross the road. Since Denis has all thoughts about his love, he couldn't solve this problem and asked us to help him. Find the minimal possible time for which he can cross the road according to these rules, or find that it is impossible to do.

Input

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, 2 ≤ m ≤ min(n + 1, 10^4)) — road width and the number of safety islands.

The second line contains m distinct integers d_1, d_2, …, d_m (0 ≤ d_i ≤ n) — the points where the safety islands are located. It is guaranteed that there are 0 and n among them.

The third line contains two integers g, r (1 ≤ g, r ≤ 1000) — the time that the green light stays on and the time that the red light stays on.

Output

Output a single integer — the minimum time for which Denis can cross the road with obeying all the rules.

If it is impossible to cross the road output -1.

Examples

Input


15 5
0 3 7 14 15
11 11


Output


45

Input


13 4
0 3 7 13
9 9


Output


-1

Note

In the first test, the optimal route is: 

  * for the first green light, go to 7 and return to 3. In this case, we will change the direction of movement at the point 7, which is allowed, since there is a safety island at this point. In the end, we will be at the point of 3, where there is also a safety island. The next 11 seconds we have to wait for the red light. 
  * for the second green light reaches 14. Wait for the red light again. 
  * for 1 second go to 15. As a result, Denis is at the end of the road. 



In total, 45 seconds are obtained.

In the second test, it is impossible to cross the road according to all the rules.

assistant: ### Phase 3: Implement the Natural Language Invariants in C++

Let's translate the previously identified natural language invariants into C++ runtime checks.

1. **High Step Count to Reach Safety Island**:
   - **Description**: “When the distances between safety islands are large relative to `g`, Denis may reach maximum travel length without reaching an island, causing excessive turning and waiting.”
   - **C++ Check**:
   ```cpp
   void check_distance_to_islands(long long distance, long long g) {
       if (distance > g) {
           cerr << "Warning: Large distance between islands relative to green light duration!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Repetitive Queue Processing for Same Positions**:
   - **Description**: “If Denis frequently revisits the same path positions due to lack of forward progress, excessive computation occurs.”
   - **C++ Check**:
   ```cpp
   void check_repetitive_processing(bool condition) {
       if (condition) {
           cerr << "Warning: Repeated processing of the same position detected!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Long Red Light Durations Relative to Path Dynamics**:
   - **Description**: “Prolonged waiting periods occur when the red light duration `r` is much longer than necessary, leading to compounded idle time.”
   - **C++ Check**:
   ```cpp
   void check_red_light_duration(long long g, long long r) {
       if (r > g * 2) {
           cerr << "Warning: Red light duration is excessively long compared to green light duration!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

4. **Sparse Safety Islands with High `n`**:
   - **Description**: “When safety islands are sparse across a wide road (large `n`), Denis may lack flexibility to optimize his path.”
   - **C++ Check**:
   ```cpp
   void check_safety_island_density(long long n, long long m) {
       if (m < n / 10) {
           cerr << "Warning: Sparse safety islands across a large road detected!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Integrate Checker Code into Original Program

Below is the instrumented C++ code with the performance-invariant checks:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
const long long N = 1e4 + 7, M = 1009;
const long long INF = LLONG_MAX;
long long arr[N + 2], vis[N][M], dis[N][M];
long long n, m, G, R;

// Performance checks based on earlier analysis
void check_distance_to_islands(long long distance, long long g) {
    if (distance > g) {
        cerr << "Warning: Large distance between islands relative to green light duration!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_repetitive_processing(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Repeated processing of the same position detected!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_red_light_duration(long long g, long long r) {
    if (r > g * 2) {
        cerr << "Warning: Red light duration is excessively long compared to green light duration!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_safety_island_density(long long n, long long m) {
    if (m < n / 10) {
        cerr << "Warning: Sparse safety islands across a large road detected!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

long long getit() {
    queue<pair<long long, long long> > q[G + 1];
    long long cur = 0;
    q[cur].push({0, G});
    vis[0][0] = 1;
    dis[0][0] = 0;
    set<long long> st = {cur};
    auto check = [&](long long w, long long idx, long long g, long long edge_weight) {
        if (idx < 0 or idx >= m or g < 0) {
            return false;
        }
        pair<long long, long long> nxt = {idx, g};
        if (!vis[nxt.first][nxt.second]) {
            vis[nxt.first][nxt.second] = 1;
            dis[nxt.first][nxt.second] = w + edge_weight;
            long long y = (cur + edge_weight) % (G + 1);
            st.insert(y);
            q[y].push(nxt);
        }
        return true;
    };
    while (st.size()) {
        auto x = st.lower_bound(cur);
        if (x == st.end())
            cur = *st.begin();
        else
            cur = *x;
        pair<long long, long long> f = q[cur].front();
        q[cur].pop();
        long long id = f.first, g = f.second, w = dis[f.first][f.second];
        long long edge_weight = R;
        if (!g)
            check(w, id, G, R);
        else {
            long long nx = arr[id + 1], pr = -1, cr = arr[id];
            if (id) pr = arr[id - 1];
            edge_weight = abs(cr - nx);
            check_distance_to_islands(edge_weight, G);
            check(w, id + 1, g - edge_weight, edge_weight);
            edge_weight = abs(cr - pr);
            check(w, id - 1, g - edge_weight, edge_weight);
        }
        if (q[cur].empty()) st.erase(cur);
    }
    long long ans = INF;
    for (long long g = 0; g < (long long)G + 1; g++)
        if (vis[m - 1][g]) ans = min(ans, dis[m - 1][g]);
    if (ans == INF) ans = -1;
    return ans;
}

void solve() {
    cin >> n >> m;
    for (long long i = 0; i < (long long)m; i++) cin >> arr[i];
    sort(arr, arr + m);
    cin >> G >> R;

    // Check for sparse safety islands
    check_safety_island_density(n, m);

    // Check for red light duration
    check_red_light_duration(G, R);

    cout << getit();
}

int32_t main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
    cin.tie(0);
    cout.tie(0);
    long long test = 1;
    while (test--) solve();
}
```

These checks are strategically placed to ensure they are executed at appropriate points without adding overhead to critical loops, helping to identify potential performance bottlenecks.
