system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

If the girl doesn't go to Denis, then Denis will go to the girl. Using this rule, the young man left home, bought flowers and went to Nastya. 

On the way from Denis's house to the girl's house is a road of n lines. This road can't be always crossed in one green light. Foreseeing this, the good mayor decided to place safety islands in some parts of the road. Each safety island is located after a line, as well as at the beginning and at the end of the road. Pedestrians can relax on them, gain strength and wait for a green light.

Denis came to the edge of the road exactly at the moment when the green light turned on. The boy knows that the traffic light first lights up g seconds green, and then r seconds red, then again g seconds green and so on.

Formally, the road can be represented as a segment [0, n]. Initially, Denis is at point 0. His task is to get to point n in the shortest possible time.

He knows many different integers d_1, d_2, …, d_m, where 0 ≤ d_i ≤ n — are the coordinates of points, in which the safety islands are located. Only at one of these points, the boy can be at a time when the red light is on.

Unfortunately, Denis isn't always able to control himself because of the excitement, so some restrictions are imposed:

  * He must always move while the green light is on because it's difficult to stand when so beautiful girl is waiting for you. Denis can change his position by ± 1 in 1 second. While doing so, he must always stay inside the segment [0, n]. 
  * He can change his direction only on the safety islands (because it is safe). This means that if in the previous second the boy changed his position by +1 and he walked on a safety island, then he can change his position by ± 1. Otherwise, he can change his position only by +1. Similarly, if in the previous second he changed his position by -1, on a safety island he can change position by ± 1, and at any other point by -1. 
  * At the moment when the red light is on, the boy must be on one of the safety islands. He can continue moving in any direction when the green light is on. 



Denis has crossed the road as soon as his coordinate becomes equal to n.

This task was not so simple, because it's possible that it is impossible to cross the road. Since Denis has all thoughts about his love, he couldn't solve this problem and asked us to help him. Find the minimal possible time for which he can cross the road according to these rules, or find that it is impossible to do.

Input

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, 2 ≤ m ≤ min(n + 1, 10^4)) — road width and the number of safety islands.

The second line contains m distinct integers d_1, d_2, …, d_m (0 ≤ d_i ≤ n) — the points where the safety islands are located. It is guaranteed that there are 0 and n among them.

The third line contains two integers g, r (1 ≤ g, r ≤ 1000) — the time that the green light stays on and the time that the red light stays on.

Output

Output a single integer — the minimum time for which Denis can cross the road with obeying all the rules.

If it is impossible to cross the road output -1.

Examples

Input


15 5
0 3 7 14 15
11 11


Output


45

Input


13 4
0 3 7 13
9 9


Output


-1

Note

In the first test, the optimal route is: 

  * for the first green light, go to 7 and return to 3. In this case, we will change the direction of movement at the point 7, which is allowed, since there is a safety island at this point. In the end, we will be at the point of 3, where there is also a safety island. The next 11 seconds we have to wait for the red light. 
  * for the second green light reaches 14. Wait for the red light again. 
  * for 1 second go to 15. As a result, Denis is at the end of the road. 



In total, 45 seconds are obtained.

In the second test, it is impossible to cross the road according to all the rules.

assistant: To analyze the performance bottlenecks in the provided C program, we need to compare the hit counts for the different lines of code between the "fast" and "slow" inputs. This will help us identify which parts of the code are significantly more frequently executed in the slow scenario.

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Key Observations**:
   - The `update` function (lines 8 to 14) is called 511 times for the slow input but only once for the fast input.
   - The loop starting at line 26 is executed 518 times in the slow scenario, compared to only 4 times for the fast input.
   - Most lines within this loop, particularly around the `update` function calls, are executed significantly more for the slow input.

2. **Inference**:
   - The slow input results in a higher number of iterations due to more frequent updates to the data structures (`q` and `w`), indicating a more complex path or sequence of operations required to reach the solution.
   - The inefficient part seems to be the breadth-first search logic combined with the conditions under which the `update` function gets called.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

From the analysis, we can derive the following performance-characterizing invariants:

1. **High Number of Potential Paths**:
   - "If the number of safety islands creates many possible paths that need to be explored (due to their positioning relative to 'g' and 'r'), the breadth-first search will have to explore many configurations, leading to slower performance."

2. **Inefficient Use of Light Cycle**:
   - "When the cycle of green (`g`) and red (`r`) light requires frequent stops and waits, Denis may end up spending more time due to being not ideally positioned relative to the safety islands. This can occur even for medium-sized `g` and `r` if their ratio does not align well with the distances between islands."

3. **Excessive State Re-exploration**:
   - "If Denis often revisits the same states with only slightly different time parameters, the program may slow down significantly due to the repetitive nature of updates and checks."

These invariants suggest that the program's performance is particularly sensitive to combinations of safety island distances and light cycle durations that cause Denis to explore or revisit states excessively. The key performance inhibitors seem to be rooted in the breadth of the state space explored and how optimally the green light duration allows for progress between islands.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
If the girl doesn't go to Denis, then Denis will go to the girl. Using this rule, the young man left home, bought flowers and went to Nastya. 

On the way from Denis's house to the girl's house is a road of n lines. This road can't be always crossed in one green light. Foreseeing this, the good mayor decided to place safety islands in some parts of the road. Each safety island is located after a line, as well as at the beginning and at the end of the road. Pedestrians can relax on them, gain strength and wait for a green light.

Denis came to the edge of the road exactly at the moment when the green light turned on. The boy knows that the traffic light first lights up g seconds green, and then r seconds red, then again g seconds green and so on.

Formally, the road can be represented as a segment [0, n]. Initially, Denis is at point 0. His task is to get to point n in the shortest possible time.

He knows many different integers d_1, d_2, …, d_m, where 0 ≤ d_i ≤ n — are the coordinates of points, in which the safety islands are located. Only at one of these points, the boy can be at a time when the red light is on.

Unfortunately, Denis isn't always able to control himself because of the excitement, so some restrictions are imposed:

  * He must always move while the green light is on because it's difficult to stand when so beautiful girl is waiting for you. Denis can change his position by ± 1 in 1 second. While doing so, he must always stay inside the segment [0, n]. 
  * He can change his direction only on the safety islands (because it is safe). This means that if in the previous second the boy changed his position by +1 and he walked on a safety island, then he can change his position by ± 1. Otherwise, he can change his position only by +1. Similarly, if in the previous second he changed his position by -1, on a safety island he can change position by ± 1, and at any other point by -1. 
  * At the moment when the red light is on, the boy must be on one of the safety islands. He can continue moving in any direction when the green light is on. 



Denis has crossed the road as soon as his coordinate becomes equal to n.

This task was not so simple, because it's possible that it is impossible to cross the road. Since Denis has all thoughts about his love, he couldn't solve this problem and asked us to help him. Find the minimal possible time for which he can cross the road according to these rules, or find that it is impossible to do.

Input

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, 2 ≤ m ≤ min(n + 1, 10^4)) — road width and the number of safety islands.

The second line contains m distinct integers d_1, d_2, …, d_m (0 ≤ d_i ≤ n) — the points where the safety islands are located. It is guaranteed that there are 0 and n among them.

The third line contains two integers g, r (1 ≤ g, r ≤ 1000) — the time that the green light stays on and the time that the red light stays on.

Output

Output a single integer — the minimum time for which Denis can cross the road with obeying all the rules.

If it is impossible to cross the road output -1.

Examples

Input


15 5
0 3 7 14 15
11 11


Output


45

Input


13 4
0 3 7 13
9 9


Output


-1

Note

In the first test, the optimal route is: 

  * for the first green light, go to 7 and return to 3. In this case, we will change the direction of movement at the point 7, which is allowed, since there is a safety island at this point. In the end, we will be at the point of 3, where there is also a safety island. The next 11 seconds we have to wait for the red light. 
  * for the second green light reaches 14. Wait for the red light again. 
  * for 1 second go to 15. As a result, Denis is at the end of the road. 



In total, 45 seconds are obtained.

In the second test, it is impossible to cross the road according to all the rules.

assistant: ## Phase 3: Implement Performance Characterizing Invariants in C++

Based on the natural language invariants derived earlier, we can implement the corresponding runtime checks as follows:

### Invariant 1: High Number of Potential Paths
This check will identify when the breadth-first search has to explore an excessive number of states due to the arrangement of safety islands and the light cycle.

```cpp
void check_path_invariant(size_t queueSize) {
    if (queueSize > 10000) {  // This threshold is arbitrary and should be adjusted based on experimentation and profiling.
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive path exploration!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Invariant 2: Inefficient Use of Light Cycle
This check will trigger if the light cycle (green and red) does not align well with the distances between islands, causing excessive waiting.

```cpp
void check_light_cycle_invariant(int g, int r, int maxIslandDistance) {
    if (g < maxIslandDistance) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - inefficient light cycle!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Invariant 3: Excessive State Re-exploration
This check will help detect when the program re-explores the same states too frequently.

```cpp
void check_state_reexploration_invariant(int stateCount) {
    if (stateCount > 5000) {  // An example threshold for excessive state exploration
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive state re-exploration!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

## Phase 4: Integrate Checkers into Original Program

Now, let’s integrate these checkers into the C++ program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

long long f[10001][1001];
int n, m, r, g;
int a[10001];
vector<pair<long long, pair<int, int> > > q[10011];
set<int> w;

// Check performance invariants
void check_path_invariant(size_t queueSize) {
    if (queueSize > 10000) {  // Arbitrary threshold for excessive path exploration
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive path exploration!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_light_cycle_invariant(int g, int r, int maxIslandDistance) {
    if (g < maxIslandDistance) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - inefficient light cycle!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_state_reexploration_invariant(int stateCount) {
    if (stateCount > 5000) {  // Example threshold for excessive state exploration
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive state re-exploration!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Helper function to update queue and state
void update(long long v, int x, int y) {
    if (x == 1 && !y) return;
    if (!f[x][y] || f[x][y] > v) {
        f[x][y] = v;
        int tmp = y + ((v / (r + g)) % 4) * (r + g);
        if (q[tmp].empty()) w.insert(tmp);
        q[tmp].push_back({v, {x, y}});
    }
}

int main() {
    scanf("%d %d", &n, &m);
    for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) scanf("%d", &a[i]);
    sort(a + 1, a + m + 1);
    q[0].push_back({0, {1, 0}});
    scanf("%d %d", &g, &r);

    // Check light cycle invariant
    int maxIslandDistance = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i < m; ++i) {
        maxIslandDistance = max(maxIslandDistance, a[i + 1] - a[i]);
    }
    check_light_cycle_invariant(g, r, maxIslandDistance);

    int i = 0;
    w.insert(0);
    while (1) {
        check_state_reexploration_invariant(w.size());

        for (auto v : q[i]) {
            auto u = v;
            if (u.first != f[u.second.first][u.second.second]) continue;
            if (u.second.first == m) {
                printf("%lld\n", u.first);
                return 0;
            }
            if (u.second.second == g) u.second.second = 0, u.first += r;
            if (u.second.first > 1) {
                if (u.second.second + a[u.second.first] - a[u.second.first - 1] <= g)
                    update(u.first + a[u.second.first] - a[u.second.first - 1],
                           u.second.first - 1,
                           u.second.second + a[u.second.first] - a[u.second.first - 1]);
            }
            if (u.second.second + a[u.second.first + 1] - a[u.second.first] <= g)
                update(u.first + a[u.second.first + 1] - a[u.second.first],
                       u.second.first + 1,
                       u.second.second + a[u.second.first + 1] - a[u.second.first]);
        }
        q[i].clear();
        w.erase(i);
        
        check_path_invariant(w.size());

        if (w.empty()) break;
        auto u = w.upper_bound(i);
        if (u == w.end()) {
            i = *(w.begin());
        } else {
            i = *u;
        }
    }
    puts("-1");
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

- **Check Path Invariant:** Inserted after each iteration of the main loop to ensure we aren't exploring too many paths.
- **Check Light Cycle Invariant:** Used after input to determine if the green light duration (`g`) is sufficient given the maximum distance between islands.
- **Check State Re-exploration Invariant:** Placed at strategic points in the loop to detect redundant state checks.

These checks help identify conditions when the program might experience performance bottlenecks due to excessive path exploration, inefficient light cycle usage, or repeated state re-exploration.
