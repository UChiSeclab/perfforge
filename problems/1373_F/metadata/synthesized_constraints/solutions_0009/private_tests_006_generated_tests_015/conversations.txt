system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

The government of Berland decided to improve network coverage in his country. Berland has a unique structure: the capital in the center and n cities in a circle around the capital. The capital already has a good network coverage (so the government ignores it), but the i-th city contains a_i households that require a connection.

The government designed a plan to build n network stations between all pairs of neighboring cities which will maintain connections only for these cities. In other words, the i-th network station will provide service only for the i-th and the (i + 1)-th city (the n-th station is connected to the n-th and the 1-st city).

All network stations have capacities: the i-th station can provide the connection to at most b_i households.

Now the government asks you to check can the designed stations meet the needs of all cities or not — that is, is it possible to assign each household a network station so that each network station i provides the connection to at most b_i households.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains the single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) — the number of cities and stations.

The second line of each test case contains n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) — the number of households in the i-th city.

The third line of each test case contains n integers (1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9) — the capacities of the designed stations.

It's guaranteed that the sum of n over test cases doesn't exceed 10^6.

Output

For each test case, print YES, if the designed stations can meet the needs of all cities, or NO otherwise (case insensitive).

  * the second station can provide 2 connections to the second city and 1 connection to the third city; 
  * the third station can provide 3 connections to the third city. 



In the second test case: 

  * the 1-st station can provide 2 connections to the 1-st city; 
  * the 2-nd station can provide 3 connections to the 2-nd city; 
  * the 3-rd station can provide 3 connections to the 3-rd city and 1 connection to the 1-st station. 



In the third test case, the fourth city needs 5 connections, but the third and the fourth station has 4 connections in total.

assistant: To analyze the given C code and derive performance-characterizing invariants, let's go through the two phases as described in the task.

### Phase 1: Identifying Expensive and Inefficient Code Segments

The main focus here is on the hit counts and identifying bottlenecks in the code. 

1. **Comparing Line-Level Hit Counts:**
   - The key lines with significant hit count differences between slow and fast runs are primarily within the nested loops and conditional structures.
   - Lines within the `while(1)` and `for(s = 0; s < N; s++)` loops in particular see a high hit count during slow runs, indicating potential inefficiencies.

2. **Pinpointing Heavy-Hit Lines:**
   - **Line 19:** The `for (s = 0; s < N; s++)` loop has a significantly higher hit count in the slow input, suggesting that it is iterating many more times than in the fast input. This loop might be checking each city-station pair multiple times due to unmet conditions.
   - **Line 36:** The inner loop `for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)` also shows a high hit count. This indicates repeated processing of cities and stations, likely driven by unmet conditions causing the loop to reset and iterate again.

3. **Inference on Interaction with Data Structures:**
   - The interaction with arrays `a` and `b` (household needs and station capacities) suggests that the loops are attempting to redistribute connections across cities, but failing to converge quickly in the slow inputs due to constraints not being met.

### Phase 2: Deriving Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the analysis, the following invariants describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow execution path:

1. **When Household Needs Exceed Immediate Capacity:** 
   - "If the total household needs in a segment of cities consistently exceed the combined capacity of their neighboring network stations, the program may repeatedly attempt but fail to find a feasible distribution, causing slow performance."

2. **High Iteration Count Due to Unmet Conditions:**
   - "If the unmet conditions in the nested loops cause the iteration counters to reach high values, the program may enter a prolonged cycle of computation trying to resolve these conditions, leading to slowdown."

3. **Circular Dependency and Redistribution:**
   - "If cities form a circular dependency where redistributing household connections does not resolve excess demand (i.e., backtracking to handle unmet needs), execution time may increase significantly as the program cycles through potential solutions."

4. **Excessive Backtracking Due to Recurring Unbalance:**
   - "If adjustments in one city's connection lead to subsequent imbalances in neighboring cities, the program may slow down due to excessive backtracking and redistribution attempts."

### Suggested Code for Invariants (Illustrative):

```cpp
void check_high_need_invariant(int total_need, int total_capacity) {
    if (total_need > total_capacity) {
        cerr << "Warning: high_need_invariant triggered - unmet household needs exceed capacity" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_iteration_invariant(int iteration_count, int threshold) {
    if (iteration_count > threshold) {
        cerr << "Warning: iteration_invariant triggered - excessive loop iterations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Example placement in code
int total_need = accumulate(a, a + N, 0); // Sum of all household needs in current cycle
int total_capacity = accumulate(b, b + N, 0); // Sum of all station capacities in current cycle

check_high_need_invariant(total_need, total_capacity);

int iteration_threshold = 100; // Example threshold value
check_iteration_invariant(cnt, iteration_threshold);
```

### Important Considerations:
- These invariants abstract the specific conditions that lead to inefficient loop execution and redistribution logic.
- The threshold values used in the illustrations are hypothetical and should be tuned based on further profiling and testing.
- This analysis helps identify conditions that, when met, may cause the program to enter a slow path, allowing for targeted optimization or early exit strategies for such cases.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}

Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
The government of Berland decided to improve network coverage in his country. Berland has a unique structure: the capital in the center and n cities in a circle around the capital. The capital already has a good network coverage (so the government ignores it), but the i-th city contains a_i households that require a connection.

The government designed a plan to build n network stations between all pairs of neighboring cities which will maintain connections only for these cities. In other words, the i-th network station will provide service only for the i-th and the (i + 1)-th city (the n-th station is connected to the n-th and the 1-st city).

All network stations have capacities: the i-th station can provide the connection to at most b_i households.

Now the government asks you to check can the designed stations meet the needs of all cities or not — that is, is it possible to assign each household a network station so that each network station i provides the connection to at most b_i households.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains the single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) — the number of cities and stations.

The second line of each test case contains n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) — the number of households in the i-th city.

The third line of each test case contains n integers (1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9) — the capacities of the designed stations.

It's guaranteed that the sum of n over test cases doesn't exceed 10^6.

Output

For each test case, print YES, if the designed stations can meet the needs of all cities, or NO otherwise (case insensitive).

Note

In the first test case: 

  * the first network station can provide 2 connections to the first city and 1 connection to the second city; 
  * the second station can provide 2 connections to the second city and 1 connection to the third city; 
  * the third station can provide 3 connections to the third city. 



In the second test case: 

  * the 1-st station can provide 2 connections to the 1-st city; 
  * the 2-nd station can provide 3 connections to the 2-nd city; 
  * the 3-rd station can provide 3 connections to the 3-rd city and 1 connection to the 1-st station. 



In the third test case, the fourth city needs 5 connections, but the third and the fourth station has 4 connections in total.

assistant: ### Phase 3: Implementing the Invariants as C++ Checker Functions

Let's translate the natural language performance-characterizing invariants into C++ code to check these conditions at runtime.

#### Invariant 1: When Household Needs Exceed Immediate Capacity
```cpp
void check_high_need_invariant(int total_need, int total_capacity) {
    if (total_need > total_capacity) {
        cerr << "Warning: high_need_invariant triggered - unmet household needs exceed total network capacity" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

#### Invariant 2: High Iteration Count Due to Unmet Conditions
```cpp
void check_iteration_invariant(int iteration_count, int threshold) {
    if (iteration_count > threshold) {
        cerr << "Warning: iteration_invariant triggered - excessive loop iterations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

#### Invariant 3: Circular Dependency and Redistribution
```cpp
void check_circular_dependency_invariant(int redistribution_attempts, int threshold) {
    if (redistribution_attempts > threshold) {
        cerr << "Warning: circular_dependency_invariant triggered - excessive redistribution attempts" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrating Checker Functions into the Original Program

Now, integrate these checks into the provided C++ program at strategic points to avoid adding overhead in tight loops.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int T, N, a[1000001], b[1000001];
bool chk[1000001];

// Checker function implementations
void check_high_need_invariant(int total_need, int total_capacity) {
    if (total_need > total_capacity) {
        cerr << "Warning: high_need_invariant triggered - unmet household needs exceed total network capacity" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_iteration_invariant(int iteration_count, int threshold) {
    if (iteration_count > threshold) {
        cerr << "Warning: iteration_invariant triggered - excessive loop iterations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_circular_dependency_invariant(int redistribution_attempts, int threshold) {
    if (redistribution_attempts > threshold) {
        cerr << "Warning: circular_dependency_invariant triggered - excessive redistribution attempts" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);
    cin >> T;
    while (T--) {
        cin >> N;
        for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
            cin >> a[i];
            chk[i] = 0;
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) cin >> b[i];
        
        int s, prev = -1, cnt = 0;

        // Calculate total need and capacity before starting main logic
        int total_need = accumulate(a, a + N, 0);
        int total_capacity = accumulate(b, b + N, 0); 
        
        // Check if initial needs exceed capacities
        check_high_need_invariant(total_need, total_capacity);
        
        while (1) {
            int f = 0;
            for (s = 0; s < N; s++) {
                if (a[s] > b[s] && f == 0)
                    f = 1;
                else if (f == 1 && b[s] >= a[s])
                    break;
            }
            if (f == 0) {
                cout << "YES\n";
                break;
            } else if (s == N && a[0] > b[0]) {
                cout << "NO\n";
                break;
            }
            if (f == 1 && s == N) {
                s = 0;
            }
            chk[s] = 1;
            for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
                int now = (s + i) % N;
                int nxt = (now + 1) % N;
                if (b[now] < a[now]) continue;
                chk[nxt] = 0;
                int x = min(a[nxt], b[now] - a[now]);
                a[nxt] -= x;
                b[now] -= x;
            }
            cnt++;
            // Check iteration invariant after each complete redistribution attempt
            check_iteration_invariant(cnt, 100); // hypothetical threshold value
            if (cnt == 71) {
                cout << "NO\n";
                break;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
- **`check_high_need_invariant`:** Added before entering the main loop to ensure that the total needs do not initially exceed the total capacities.
- **`check_iteration_invariant`:** Added after each redistribution cycle to catch excessive iterations.
- **`check_circular_dependency_invariant` (represented by `check_iteration_invariant`):** Serves to detect when excessive redistribution attempts are made due to potential circular dependencies or unresolved distribution issues.
