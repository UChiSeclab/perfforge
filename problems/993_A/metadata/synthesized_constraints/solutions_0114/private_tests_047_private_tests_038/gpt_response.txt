### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

From the hit count analysis, we notice the following lines and functions with significant differences between the slow and fast inputs:

1. **Line 21 (Function `norm`)**:
   - Hit count: Slow input = 323,208; Fast input = 808.
   - This function is hit significantly more times in the slow input, indicating that it may be a bottleneck.

2. **Line 38 (Outer loop iterating over `i`)**:
   - Hit count: Slow input = 202; Fast input = 1.
   - This loop is executed more times for the slow input, which suggests that the outer iteration is a factor in performance.

3. **Line 39 (Inner loop iterating over `j`)**:
   - Hit count: Slow input = 40,602; Fast input = 101.
   - Like the outer loop, this inner loop is executed a significantly larger number of times in the slow input scenario.

4. **Line 44 and 51 (Loop over vectors `W1` and `W2`)**:
   - Hit counts: Slow input = 161,604 (each); Fast input = 404 (each).
   - These loops make calls to the `norm` function, contributing to the high execution count.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the analysis of line hit counts and the observed input constraints, we can derive the following performance-characterizing invariants:

1. **Invariant 1: Grid Search Overhead**
   - **Natural Language Description**: "If the algorithm performs a grid search over a large number of points (near the maximum range of coordinates from -100 to 100), the performance will degrade significantly due to the extensive iteration."
   - **Condition**: The loops at lines 38 and 39 iterate over a 201x201 grid. If both squares are positioned such that the algorithm must evaluate a large grid region, the performance will slow down.

2. **Invariant 2: High Frequency of `norm` Function Calls**
   - **Natural Language Description**: "If the `norm` function is invoked excessively due to overlapping or nearly overlapping configurations of the two squares, performance will degrade as this function is computationally intensive and called repeatedly."
   - **Condition**: The function is called within nested loops that iterate over all vectors and points, suggesting that when the squares are positioned such that they require extensive checks, the function becomes a bottleneck.

3. **Invariant 3: Extensive Vector Intersection Checks**
   - **Natural Language Description**: "When the algorithm must check the intersection of vectors formed by the square sides over a dense grid of points, especially when the squares are close together, performance may degrade due to the large number of intersection evaluations."
   - **Condition**: The loops involving vector intersection checks are executed a large number of times when the squares are aligned such that potential overlap regions are large.

By implementing these invariants, a fuzzer or a performance testing framework could detect and prevent scenarios that lead to inefficiency in the algorithm, ensuring more consistent performance across different input configurations.

### Phase 3: Implementing Invariants as Runtime Checks in C++

Let's translate the previously derived natural language invariants into C++ runtime checks:

1. **Grid Search Overhead Check**: This check will validate if the extensive grid search, iterating over a large number of points, is happening.

```cpp
void check_grid_search_invariant(int i_max, int j_max) {
    if (i_max > 200 && j_max > 200) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to large grid search!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

2. **High Frequency of `norm` Function Calls Check**: This check identifies if the `norm` function is being called excessively, indicating a potential performance bottleneck.

```cpp
static long long norm_call_count = 0;

void increment_norm_call_count() {
    norm_call_count++;
}

void check_norm_calls_invariant() {
    if (norm_call_count > 100000) { // Example threshold based on known expensive calls
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to excessive norm function calls!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

3. **Extensive Vector Intersection Checks**: This check will determine if vector intersection checks are being done extensively.

```cpp
void check_vector_intersection_invariant(int intersection_checks) {
    if (intersection_checks > 100000) { // Arbitrary threshold for extensive checks
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to extensive vector intersection checks!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrate Checks into the Original C++ Program

Integrate these checks into the original program, ensuring they are placed effectively to detect performance bottlenecks without adding overhead to inner loops.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
const long double eps = 0.0000001;
const long long inf = 1e15;

struct point {
  long long x, y;
  point() {}
  point(long long a, long long b) {
    x = a;
    y = b;
  }
};

struct vec {
  point st, fin;
  vec() {}
  vec(point a, point b) {
    st = a;
    fin = b;
  }
};

long long norm(vec q, point a) {
  increment_norm_call_count(); // Increment norm call counter
  long long x1 = q.fin.x - q.st.x, x2 = a.x - q.st.x;
  long long y1 = q.fin.y - q.st.y, y2 = a.y - q.st.y;
  if (x1 * y2 - x2 * y1 < 0) return 1;
  if (x1 * y2 - x2 * y1 == 0) return 0;
  return -1;
}

// Function to check grid search invariant
void check_grid_search_invariant(int i_max, int j_max) {
    if (i_max > 200 && j_max > 200) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to large grid search!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Function to check norm calls invariant
void check_norm_calls_invariant() {
    if (norm_call_count > 100000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to excessive norm function calls!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Function to check vector intersection invariant
void check_vector_intersection_invariant(int intersection_checks) {
    if (intersection_checks > 100000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to extensive vector intersection checks!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

signed main() {
  point A1, B1, C1, D1;
  point A2, B2, C2, D2;
  cin >> A1.x >> A1.y >> B1.x >> B1.y >> C1.x >> C1.y >> D1.x >> D1.y;
  cin >> A2.x >> A2.y >> B2.x >> B2.y >> C2.x >> C2.y >> D2.x >> D2.y;
  vec v11 = vec(A1, B1), v12 = vec(B1, C1), v13 = vec(C1, D1),
      v14 = vec(D1, A1);
  vec v21 = vec(A2, B2), v22 = vec(B2, C2), v23 = vec(C2, D2),
      v24 = vec(D2, A2);
  vector<vec> W1 = {v11, v12, v13, v14}, W2 = {v21, v22, v23, v24};

  // Check grid search invariant before loops
  check_grid_search_invariant(201, 201);

  for (long long i = -100; i < 101; ++i) {
    for (long long j = -100; j < 101; ++j) {
      point a = point(i, j);
      long long q1 = 0, q2 = 0;
      long long val1 = 0, val2 = 0;
      int intersection_checks = 0; // Counter for intersection checks

      for (auto u : W1) {
        long long b = norm(u, a);
        if (b == 0)
          q1++;
        else
          val1 += b;
        intersection_checks++; // Increment intersection check counter
      }

      for (auto u : W2) {
        long long b = norm(u, a);
        if (b == 0)
          q2++;
        else
          val2 += b;
        intersection_checks++; // Increment intersection check counter
      }

      // Check vector intersection invariant
      check_vector_intersection_invariant(intersection_checks);

      if (val1 < 0)
        val1 -= q1;
      else
        val1 += q1;
      if (val2 < 0)
        val2 -= q2;
      else
        val2 += q2;
      if (abs(val1) == 4 && abs(val2) == 4) {
        cout << "YES";
        return 0;
      }
    }
  }

  // Check norm calls invariant after loops
  check_norm_calls_invariant();

  cout << "NO";
  return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of Integration:

- **Grid Search Check**: Executed once before entering the main loops to ensure we don't iterate over an excessive number of points.
- **Norm Calls Check**: Accumulates the count of `norm` calls and checks after the loops.
- **Intersection Checks**: Counts the intersection evaluations per point and verifies within each iteration.
