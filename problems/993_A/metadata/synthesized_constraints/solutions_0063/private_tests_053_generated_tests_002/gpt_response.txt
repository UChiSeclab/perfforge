=== Invariants Response ===
Based on the provided C program, hit count information, and the problem statement, we can analyze the performance bottlenecks and derive performance-characterizing invariants:

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Hit Count Analysis**:
   - The `okn` function has significantly more hits on the slow input (405 hits) compared to the fast input (4 hits).
   - The `okm` function is called a staggering 18,816 times on the slow input, whereas it is only called 3 times on the fast input.
   - The nested loops on lines 48 and 49, which iterate over a large range of coordinate values, are heavily hit on the slow input, with the inner loop (line 49) executing 18,905 times.

2. **Data Structure and Loop Interaction**:
   - The nested iterations from -100 to 100 suggest an exhaustive check for intersections, indicating that the algorithm falls back on a brute-force approach when initial checks do not yield a result.
   - The sorting operations on lines 36 and 37 are consistently hit but are not the primary source of slowdown, given their limited execution.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **Invariant for Brute-Force Exhaustive Check**:
   - **Natural language description**: "The program enters a slow path when neither square's vertices are within the boundaries of the other, leading to a brute-force check over a wide coordinate range."
   - **Explanation**: When the initial checks in the `okn` and `okm` functions do not confirm an intersection, the program resorts to checking every point in a large area, which is expensive.

2. **Invariant for High Iteration in `okm` Function**:
   - **Natural language description**: "If the vertices of the square with sides at 45 degrees to the axes do not fall within the axis-aligned square, the program may perform excessive iterations over potential intersection points."
   - **Explanation**: This condition leads to the `okm` function being called numerous times without early termination, significantly slowing down the execution.

3. **Input Size and Complexity**:
   - **Natural language description**: "The program performance degrades when the squares are positioned such that they do not trivially intersect, necessitating an exhaustive search across their potential intersection space."
   - **Explanation**: If neither set of vertices falls within the other square, the exhaustive check over all possible intersection points is triggered.

These invariants highlight the performance challenges that arise when initial checks for intersection fail, leading to inefficient brute-force computation over a large coordinate space. The program could be optimized by improving the efficiency of the exhaustive search or implementing a more sophisticated intersection detection method that avoids such extensive iteration.

### Phase 3: Implement Checker Code for Performance Invariants

Here, we translate the identified invariants into runtime checks in C++.

1. **Checker for Brute-Force Exhaustive Check**:
   - **Invariant**: The program enters a slow path when neither square's vertices are within the boundaries of the other.
   - **Code**:
   ```cpp
   void check_exhaustive_search(bool condition) {
       if (condition) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - exhaustive search executed!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Checker for High Iteration in `okm` Function**:
   - **Invariant**: Excessive iterations occur when the vertices of the diagonal square do not intersect with the axis-aligned square.
   - **Code**:
   ```cpp
   void check_high_iteration(bool condition) {
       if (condition) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high iteration count in okm function!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Integrate Checker Code into the Original C++ Program

Here's how we can integrate these checkers in the provided program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

struct thing {
    int x;
    int y;
    bool operator<(const thing &th) const {
        if (y < th.y) return true;
        if (y == th.y && x < th.x) return true;
        return false;
    }
} m[5], n[5];

// Checker for exhaustive search
void check_exhaustive_search(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - exhaustive search executed!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Checker for high iteration count
void check_high_iteration(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high iteration count in okm function!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

bool okn(int x, int y) {
    if (x >= m[1].x)
        if (y >= m[1].y)
            if (x <= m[4].x)
                if (y <= m[4].y) return true;
    return false;
}

bool okm(int x, int y) {
    if (x + y >= n[1].x + n[1].y)
        if (x + y <= n[4].x + n[4].y)
            if (y - x >= n[1].y - n[1].x)
                if (y - x <= n[4].y - n[4].x) return true;
    return false;
}

int main() {
    for (int i = 1; i <= 4; i++) cin >> m[i].x >> m[i].y;
    for (int i = 1; i <= 4; i++) cin >> n[i].x >> n[i].y;
    sort(m + 1, m + 5);
    sort(n + 1, n + 5);

    // Check if neither square's vertices are in the other's bounds
    bool square_intersection = false;
    for (int i = 1; i <= 4; i++) {
        if (okn(n[i].x, n[i].y)) {
            square_intersection = true;
            break;
        }
    }
    for (int i = 1; i <= 4; i++) {
        if (okm(m[i].x, m[i].y)) {
            square_intersection = true;
            break;
        }
    }
    check_exhaustive_search(!square_intersection);

    // Check for high iteration in brute-force search
    bool high_iteration = false;
    for (int i = -100; i <= 100; i++) {
        for (int j = -100; j <= 100; j++) {
            if (okm(i, j) && okn(i, j)) {
                cout << "YES";
                return 0;
            }
        }
    }
    check_high_iteration(high_iteration);

    cout << "NO";
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of Integration

- **Checker Placement**: The `check_exhaustive_search` is placed after the initial vertex checks to ensure an exhaustive search is only done if those checks fail. The `check_high_iteration` is placed to guard against excessive looping in the brute-force search range.
- **Abort on Condition**: If either condition is met, a warning is issued and the program is aborted to prevent excessive computation. This helps identify input scenarios that trigger slow paths during testing.
