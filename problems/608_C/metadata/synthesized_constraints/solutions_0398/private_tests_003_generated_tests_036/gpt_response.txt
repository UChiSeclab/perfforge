### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

#### Analysis of Line-Level Hit Counts:
1. **Line 15**: `for (int i = 1; i < to + 1; i++)` is hit 1,000,002 times in the slow input versus 3 times in the fast input.
2. **Line 16**: `if (a[i] == -1)` is hit 1,000,001 times in the slow input versus 2 times in the fast input.
3. **Line 17**: `memo[i] = memo[i - 1];` is hit 1,000,000 times in the slow input versus 1 time in the fast input.
4. **Line 21**: `for (int i = 1; i < to + 1; i++)` is hit 1,000,002 times in the slow input versus 3 times in the fast input.
5. **Line 22**: `mx = max(mx, memo[i - 1] + 1);` is hit 1,000,001 times in the slow input versus 2 times in the fast input.

#### Inference:
- The slow run results in high hit counts because of the loops in lines 15 and 21, which iterate up to `to + 1`, where `to` is influenced by the position of the beacons. In the slow input, the position is near the maximum limit (1,000,000), leading to nearly maximum iteration counts.
- The memoization strategy (`memo[i] = memo[i - 1];`) in line 17 is hit frequently in the slow input, indicating that many elements are being processed in a linear fashion, which can be inefficient for large `to`.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

#### Performance Invariants:
1. **Loop Iteration Count**:
   - **Invariant**: "When the position of any beacon is close to the maximum allowed position (1,000,000), loops may iterate a very large number of times, leading to a slowdown."
   - **Explanation**: Given that `to` is determined by the maximum position of the beacons, when a beacon is positioned at or near the upper bound (1,000,000), it maximizes the iteration count for the subsequent loops, drastically increasing execution time.

2. **Sparse Array Access**:
   - **Invariant**: "When there are large gaps between the positions of beacons, the memoization array will be accessed inefficiently, as many positions will default to a placeholder value (e.g., -1), leading to linear time updates over a large range."
   - **Explanation**: If a large number of positions in the array `a` are default values, the loop frequently performs simple assignments that do not contribute useful computation, especially when iterating over a large range (`to`).

3. **Inefficient Memoization**:
   - **Invariant**: "When the power levels are large relative to the positioning of beacons, the memoization updates based on prior positions (e.g., `i - a[i] - 1`) may become inefficient, as they often fall back to defaults or do not affect a significant subset of beacons."
   - **Explanation**: If `bi` (the power level) is significant and the positions are widely spaced, the logic for updating memoization (`memo[(i - a[i] - 1 >= 0 ? i - a[i] - 1 : 0)] + 1`) may have minimal effect due to lack of overlapping influences, resulting in inefficient computational effort.

### Summary:
The performance issue arises primarily from high iteration counts due to beacon positions near their maximum limits and inefficient handling of sparse data in memoization. Efficient handling of large value ranges and optimizing loop bounds could mitigate these issues.

### Phase 3: Implement Performance-Characterizing Invariants in C++

Below are the C++ code snippets implementing the performance-characterizing invariants identified:

1. **Loop Iteration Count Invariant:**

   This invariant checks if the position of any beacon is close to the maximum allowed value, leading to potentially large loop iterations.

   ```cpp
   void check_loop_iteration_invariant(int max_position) {
       if (max_position >= 1000000) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive loop iterations due to max_position!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Sparse Array Access Invariant:**

   This invariant checks if there are large gaps between the positions of beacons, causing inefficient access patterns in memoization.

   ```cpp
   void check_sparse_array_invariant(int beacon_positions[], int size) {
       int gap_threshold = 1000; // Arbitrary threshold for large gaps
       for (int i = 1; i < size; ++i) {
           if (beacon_positions[i] - beacon_positions[i - 1] > gap_threshold) {
               cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large gaps between beacon positions!" << endl;
               abort();
           }
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Inefficient Memoization Invariant:**

   This invariant checks if the power levels are large relative to the positioning of beacons, resulting in inefficient memoization updates.

   ```cpp
   void check_memoization_invariant(int beacon_positions[], int power_levels[], int size) {
       for (int i = 0; i < size; ++i) {
           if (power_levels[i] > 100000 && beacon_positions[i] > 500000) { // Arbitrary thresholds
               cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - inefficient memoization due to large power levels!" << endl;
               abort();
           }
       }
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Integrate Checkers with the Original C++ Program

Now, let's integrate these checker functions into the original C++ solution. The checkers will be placed at logical points in the program to avoid adding overhead in tight loops.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int memo[(int)1e6 + 1000], a[(int)1e6 + 1000];

void check_loop_iteration_invariant(int max_position) {
    if (max_position >= 1000000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive loop iterations due to max_position!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_sparse_array_invariant(int beacon_positions[], int size) {
    int gap_threshold = 1000; // Arbitrary threshold for large gaps
    for (int i = 1; i < size; ++i) {
        if (beacon_positions[i] - beacon_positions[i - 1] > gap_threshold) {
            cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large gaps between beacon positions!" << endl;
            abort();
        }
    }
}

void check_memoization_invariant(int beacon_positions[], int power_levels[], int size) {
    for (int i = 0; i < size; ++i) {
        if (power_levels[i] > 100000 && beacon_positions[i] > 500000) { // Arbitrary thresholds
            cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - inefficient memoization due to large power levels!" << endl;
            abort();
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    int n, to = 0;
    cin >> n;
    vector<int> beacon_positions(n);
    vector<int> power_levels(n);
    memset(a, -1, sizeof a);

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        int tmp, power;
        cin >> tmp >> power;
        beacon_positions[i] = tmp;
        power_levels[i] = power;
        tmp++;
        a[tmp] = power;
        to = max(to, tmp);
    }

    // Insert checkers after reading inputs and computing `to`
    check_loop_iteration_invariant(to);
    check_sparse_array_invariant(beacon_positions.data(), n);
    check_memoization_invariant(beacon_positions.data(), power_levels.data(), n);

    for (int i = 1; i < to + 1; i++)
        if (a[i] == -1)
            memo[i] = memo[i - 1];
        else
            memo[i] = memo[(i - a[i] - 1 >= 0 ? i - a[i] - 1 : 0)] + 1;

    int mx = memo[to];
    for (int i = 1; i < to + 1; i++) {
        mx = max(mx, memo[i - 1] + 1);
    }
    cout << (mx == memo[to] ? n - mx : n + 1 - mx) << endl;
}
```

**Explanation of Checker Placement:**
- The check for loop iteration count is placed after determining the maximum position `to`, as it directly influences loop bounds.
- The sparse array access and memoization inefficiency checks are placed after reading and storing the beacon positions and power levels, ensuring that any problematic patterns are detected before proceeding to the main computation loop.
