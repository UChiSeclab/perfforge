system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

There are n beacons located at distinct positions on a number line. The i-th beacon has position ai and power level bi. When the i-th beacon is activated, it destroys all beacons to its left (direction of decreasing coordinates) within distance bi inclusive. The beacon itself is not destroyed however. Saitama will activate the beacons one at a time from right to left. If a beacon is destroyed, it cannot be activated.

Saitama wants Genos to add a beacon strictly to the right of all the existing beacons, with any position and any power level, such that the least possible number of beacons are destroyed. Note that Genos's placement of the beacon means it will be the first beacon activated. Help Genos by finding the minimum number of beacons that could be destroyed.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000) — the initial number of beacons.

The i-th of next n lines contains two integers ai and bi (0 ≤ ai ≤ 1 000 000, 1 ≤ bi ≤ 1 000 000) — the position and power level of the i-th beacon respectively. No two beacons will have the same position, so ai ≠ aj if i ≠ j.

Output

Print a single integer — the minimum number of beacons that could be destroyed if exactly one beacon is added.

For the second sample case, the minimum number of beacons destroyed is 3. One way to achieve this is to place a beacon at position 1337 with power level 42.

assistant: To diagnose the performance bottleneck in the provided C program and derive performance-characterizing invariants, we'll follow the specified phases.

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

Based on the hit count information, the following lines are executed significantly more times in the slow input compared to the fast input:

1. **Line 18 (`for (int i = 1; i <= maxi; i++)`)**: This loop runs `maxi + 1` times. For the slow input, `maxi` is very large (close to 1,000,000), causing the loop to have a large number of iterations.

2. **Line 19 (`if (t[i] == 0)`)** and **Line 20 (`dp[i] = dp[i - 1];`)**: These lines are executed 1,000,000 times for the slow input, indicating that most of the elements in `t` are zeroes. This leads to frequent accesses and updates in the `dp` array, which may not be necessary.

3. **Line 26 (`ans = max(ans, dp[i]);`)**: This line is executed 1,000,000 times as well, demonstrating a potential inefficiency in repeatedly calculating the maximum over a large range.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the above analysis, we can derive the following natural language performance invariants:

1. **Invariant 1: High Iteration Count Due to Large `maxi` Value**
   - Natural Language Description: "If `maxi` is very large, close to the allowed maximum of 1,000,000, the main loop will iterate a significant number of times, leading to performance degradation."
   - This invariant captures the condition where the range of iteration is excessively large, directly affecting the execution time.

2. **Invariant 2: Sparse `t` Array Leading to Unnecessary Computation**
   - Natural Language Description: "When the array `t` is mostly filled with zeroes, the program performs many redundant operations, which can cause inefficiencies."
   - This describes a scenario where the zero-check (`t[i] == 0`) results in frequent unnecessary operations due to a sparse distribution of non-zero values.

3. **Invariant 3: Frequent Maximum Calculation Over a Large Array**
   - Natural Language Description: "If the dynamic programming array `dp` is frequently updated with only incremental changes over a large range, the performance may degrade due to repeated unnecessary calculations."
   - This invariant highlights the inefficiency introduced by continuously updating the `ans` variable with minimal changes over a large dataset.

These invariants provide a broad understanding of potential performance issues in the program without relying on specific input values, and they help guide optimizations to avoid these slow paths. They are applicable to other potential inputs that fit these broad conditions.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
There are n beacons located at distinct positions on a number line. The i-th beacon has position ai and power level bi. When the i-th beacon is activated, it destroys all beacons to its left (direction of decreasing coordinates) within distance bi inclusive. The beacon itself is not destroyed however. Saitama will activate the beacons one at a time from right to left. If a beacon is destroyed, it cannot be activated.

Saitama wants Genos to add a beacon strictly to the right of all the existing beacons, with any position and any power level, such that the least possible number of beacons are destroyed. Note that Genos's placement of the beacon means it will be the first beacon activated. Help Genos by finding the minimum number of beacons that could be destroyed.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000) — the initial number of beacons.

The i-th of next n lines contains two integers ai and bi (0 ≤ ai ≤ 1 000 000, 1 ≤ bi ≤ 1 000 000) — the position and power level of the i-th beacon respectively. No two beacons will have the same position, so ai ≠ aj if i ≠ j.

Output

Print a single integer — the minimum number of beacons that could be destroyed if exactly one beacon is added.

assistant: ### Phase 3: Implementing the Natural Language Invariants in C++

Let's translate the previously derived natural language invariants into C++ checker code snippets:

1. **Invariant 1: High Iteration Count Due to Large `maxi` Value**
   - Checker Code: This will ensure that the main loop doesn't iterate more than a broad threshold that implies potential performance issues.
   
   ```cpp
   void check_maxi_invariant(int maxi) {
       if (maxi > 900000) { // Broad threshold for potential performance degradation
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to large maxi value!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Invariant 2: Sparse `t` Array Leading to Unnecessary Computation**
   - Checker Code: This will check if the `t` array has too many zeroes leading to redundant operations.
   
   ```cpp
   void check_sparse_t_invariant(int zeroCount, int maxi) {
       if (zeroCount > maxi * 0.9) { // More than 90% zeroes may indicate inefficiency
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to sparse t array!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Invariant 3: Frequent Maximum Calculation Over a Large Array**
   - Checker Code: This will ensure that the updates to the `dp` array do not cause excessive recalculation of `ans`.
   
   ```cpp
   void check_dp_update_invariant(int updateCount, int maxi) {
       if (updateCount > maxi * 0.8) { // Frequent updates may indicate inefficiency
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to excessive dp updates!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Integrating the Checks into the Original Program

Below is the modified program with the integrated checker functions:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
const int MAX_A = 1000 * 1000 + 10;
int dp[MAX_A], t[MAX_A];

// Checkers for performance bottlenecks
void check_maxi_invariant(int maxi) {
    if (maxi > 900000) { // Broad threshold for potential performance degradation
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to large maxi value!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_sparse_t_invariant(int zeroCount, int maxi) {
    if (zeroCount > maxi * 0.9) { // More than 90% zeroes may indicate inefficiency
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to sparse t array!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_dp_update_invariant(int updateCount, int maxi) {
    if (updateCount > maxi * 0.8) { // Frequent updates may indicate inefficiency
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to excessive dp updates!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    int n, ans = 0, maxi = 0, zeroCount = 0, updateCount = 0;
    cin >> n;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        int a, b;
        cin >> a >> b;
        t[a] = b;
        maxi = max(maxi, a);
    }

    // Insert the check for maxi value
    check_maxi_invariant(maxi);

    if (t[0] > 0) {
        dp[0] = 1;
        ans = 1;
    }
    for (int i = 1; i <= maxi; i++) {
        if (t[i] == 0) {
            dp[i] = dp[i - 1];
            zeroCount++; // count the number of zeros processed
        } else {
            int x = i - t[i] - 1;
            if (x >= 0) dp[i] = dp[x];
            dp[i]++;
            updateCount++; // count how many times dp[i] is updated
        }
        ans = max(ans, dp[i]);
    }

    // Insert check for sparse `t` array and excessive dp updates
    check_sparse_t_invariant(zeroCount, maxi);

### Explanation:

- **Checkers Integration**: The checkers are added after the input is processed and before the loops, ensuring they do not add overhead inside critical loops.
- **Broad Thresholds**: The thresholds are set broad enough to catch potential bottlenecks without being overly restrictive.
- **Abort on Warning**: Each warning triggers an abort to effectively signal performance issues, helping in automated detection using fuzzers.
