=== Invariants Response ===
To diagnose the performance bottleneck in the provided C program and derive performance-characterizing invariants, we'll follow the specified phases.

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

Based on the hit count information, the following lines are executed significantly more times in the slow input compared to the fast input:

1. **Line 18 (`for (int i = 1; i <= maxi; i++)`)**: This loop runs `maxi + 1` times. For the slow input, `maxi` is very large (close to 1,000,000), causing the loop to have a large number of iterations.

2. **Line 19 (`if (t[i] == 0)`)** and **Line 20 (`dp[i] = dp[i - 1];`)**: These lines are executed 1,000,000 times for the slow input, indicating that most of the elements in `t` are zeroes. This leads to frequent accesses and updates in the `dp` array, which may not be necessary.

3. **Line 26 (`ans = max(ans, dp[i]);`)**: This line is executed 1,000,000 times as well, demonstrating a potential inefficiency in repeatedly calculating the maximum over a large range.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the above analysis, we can derive the following natural language performance invariants:

1. **Invariant 1: High Iteration Count Due to Large `maxi` Value**
   - Natural Language Description: "If `maxi` is very large, close to the allowed maximum of 1,000,000, the main loop will iterate a significant number of times, leading to performance degradation."
   - This invariant captures the condition where the range of iteration is excessively large, directly affecting the execution time.

2. **Invariant 2: Sparse `t` Array Leading to Unnecessary Computation**
   - Natural Language Description: "When the array `t` is mostly filled with zeroes, the program performs many redundant operations, which can cause inefficiencies."
   - This describes a scenario where the zero-check (`t[i] == 0`) results in frequent unnecessary operations due to a sparse distribution of non-zero values.

3. **Invariant 3: Frequent Maximum Calculation Over a Large Array**
   - Natural Language Description: "If the dynamic programming array `dp` is frequently updated with only incremental changes over a large range, the performance may degrade due to repeated unnecessary calculations."
   - This invariant highlights the inefficiency introduced by continuously updating the `ans` variable with minimal changes over a large dataset.

These invariants provide a broad understanding of potential performance issues in the program without relying on specific input values, and they help guide optimizations to avoid these slow paths. They are applicable to other potential inputs that fit these broad conditions.

### Phase 3: Implementing the Natural Language Invariants in C++

Let's translate the previously derived natural language invariants into C++ checker code snippets:

1. **Invariant 1: High Iteration Count Due to Large `maxi` Value**
   - Checker Code: This will ensure that the main loop doesn't iterate more than a broad threshold that implies potential performance issues.
   
   ```cpp
   void check_maxi_invariant(int maxi) {
       if (maxi > 900000) { // Broad threshold for potential performance degradation
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to large maxi value!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Invariant 2: Sparse `t` Array Leading to Unnecessary Computation**
   - Checker Code: This will check if the `t` array has too many zeroes leading to redundant operations.
   
   ```cpp
   void check_sparse_t_invariant(int zeroCount, int maxi) {
       if (zeroCount > maxi * 0.9) { // More than 90% zeroes may indicate inefficiency
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to sparse t array!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Invariant 3: Frequent Maximum Calculation Over a Large Array**
   - Checker Code: This will ensure that the updates to the `dp` array do not cause excessive recalculation of `ans`.
   
   ```cpp
   void check_dp_update_invariant(int updateCount, int maxi) {
       if (updateCount > maxi * 0.8) { // Frequent updates may indicate inefficiency
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to excessive dp updates!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Integrating the Checks into the Original Program

Below is the modified program with the integrated checker functions:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
const int MAX_A = 1000 * 1000 + 10;
int dp[MAX_A], t[MAX_A];

// Checkers for performance bottlenecks
void check_maxi_invariant(int maxi) {
    if (maxi > 900000) { // Broad threshold for potential performance degradation
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to large maxi value!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_sparse_t_invariant(int zeroCount, int maxi) {
    if (zeroCount > maxi * 0.9) { // More than 90% zeroes may indicate inefficiency
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to sparse t array!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_dp_update_invariant(int updateCount, int maxi) {
    if (updateCount > maxi * 0.8) { // Frequent updates may indicate inefficiency
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to excessive dp updates!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    int n, ans = 0, maxi = 0, zeroCount = 0, updateCount = 0;
    cin >> n;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        int a, b;
        cin >> a >> b;
        t[a] = b;
        maxi = max(maxi, a);
    }

    // Insert the check for maxi value
    check_maxi_invariant(maxi);

    if (t[0] > 0) {
        dp[0] = 1;
        ans = 1;
    }
    for (int i = 1; i <= maxi; i++) {
        if (t[i] == 0) {
            dp[i] = dp[i - 1];
            zeroCount++; // count the number of zeros processed
        } else {
            int x = i - t[i] - 1;
            if (x >= 0) dp[i] = dp[x];
            dp[i]++;
            updateCount++; // count how many times dp[i] is updated
        }
        ans = max(ans, dp[i]);
    }

    // Insert check for sparse `t` array and excessive dp updates
    check_sparse_t_invariant(zeroCount, maxi);
    check_dp_update_invariant(updateCount, maxi);

    cout << n - ans << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:

- **Checkers Integration**: The checkers are added after the input is processed and before the loops, ensuring they do not add overhead inside critical loops.
- **Broad Thresholds**: The thresholds are set broad enough to catch potential bottlenecks without being overly restrictive.
- **Abort on Warning**: Each warning triggers an abort to effectively signal performance issues, helping in automated detection using fuzzers.
