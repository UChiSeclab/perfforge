### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Comparison of Hit Counts:**
   - The line `for (int i = 0; i < a[n - 1] + 1; i++)` is hit 1,000,002 times in the slow input and only 2 times in the fast input. This indicates that the loop is the main bottleneck for the slow input.
   - Line `if (m[i] != 0)` is executed 1,000,001 times for the slow input, while only once for the fast input, suggesting it is a frequent check that contributes to the loop's high execution count.
   - Line `dp[i] = i - 1 >= 0 ? dp[i - 1] : 0;` is executed 1,000,000 times on the slow input, but not at all on the fast input, showing that this operation within the loop is heavily repeated.

2. **Interaction with Data Structures:**
   - The loop iterates over a range from `0` to `a[n-1]`, which depends on the position of the furthest beacon (`a[n-1]`). In the slow input, this value is very large (1,000,000), causing the loop to execute many times.
   - The `dp` array is used to store results incrementally, and its size depends on the maximum position value of beacons (`a[n-1]`), leading to a significant increase in memory usage and iterations.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **Iteration Over Large Ranges:**
   - Natural language statement: "When the maximum position of beacons (a[n-1]) is very large, the number of iterations in the loop increases significantly, leading to a slow path."

2. **Dependency on Beacon Positions and Powers:**
   - Natural language statement: "Performance degrades when the power levels and positions of the beacons cause frequent, repetitive calculations, particularly when many positions up to the maximum beacon position must be checked."

3. **Inefficient Usage of Data Arrays:**
   - Natural language statement: "The program may slow down if large arrays are used for dynamic programming calculations that iterate over each possible position up to the highest value of beacon positions, consuming time and space."

### Concise Performance Invariants

1. **Iterating Over Large Position Ranges:**
   - If the maximum beacon position (`a[n-1]`) is close to the upper limit of 1,000,000, the loop iterates excessively, which is a major performance bottleneck.

2. **Extensive Dynamic Programming Calculations:**
   - When the input involves large power levels and position ranges, the resulting dynamic programming array becomes large, requiring extensive iterations and updates, which can slow down computation.

3. **Frequent Checks on Non-Zero Map Entries:**
   - The condition `if (m[i] != 0)` is checked repeatedly for large position ranges, which increases the processing time for large inputs with high power levels.

By recognizing these patterns, one can anticipate slow performance scenarios without directly relying on specific input values, focusing instead on structural properties of the input data that lead to inefficiencies.

### Phase 3: Implementing Performance-Characterizing Invariants in C++

Based on the natural language performance-characterizing invariants identified, we need to develop runtime checks that can detect these conditions in the program execution.

1. **Iterating Over Large Position Ranges:**
   - Natural language statement: "When the maximum position of beacons (a[n-1]) is very large, the number of iterations in the loop increases significantly, leading to a slow path."
   
   ```cpp
   void check_large_position_range(int maxPosition) {
       if (maxPosition > 100000) {  // Arbitrary threshold based on problem constraints
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large position range!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Extensive Dynamic Programming Calculations:**
   - Natural language statement: "Performance degrades when the power levels and positions of the beacons cause frequent, repetitive calculations."
   
   ```cpp
   void check_extensive_dp_calculations(int maxPosition, int n) {
       if (maxPosition > 100000 && n > 10000) {  // Thresholds based on problem constraints
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - extensive dynamic programming calculations!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Frequent Checks on Non-Zero Map Entries:**
   - Natural language statement: "The program may slow down if many positions up to the maximum beacon position must be checked repeatedly."
   
   ```cpp
   void check_frequent_nonzero_checks(int maxPosition) {
       if (maxPosition > 50000) {  // Arbitrary threshold to indicate frequent non-zero checks
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - frequent non-zero checks!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Integrating the Checker Code into the Original Program

Now, we'll integrate these checks into the original C++ program at effective points in the control flow.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Checker functions
void check_large_position_range(int maxPosition) {
    if (maxPosition > 100000) {  // Arbitrary threshold based on problem constraints
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large position range!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_extensive_dp_calculations(int maxPosition, int n) {
    if (maxPosition > 100000 && n > 10000) {  // Thresholds based on problem constraints
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - extensive dynamic programming calculations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_frequent_nonzero_checks(int maxPosition) {
    if (maxPosition > 50000) {  // Arbitrary threshold to indicate frequent non-zero checks
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - frequent non-zero checks!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    ios::sync_with_stdio(0);
    cin.tie(0);
    cout.tie(0);

    int n, ans = INT_MIN;
    cin >> n;
    int a[n];
    map<int, int> m;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        int x;
        cin >> a[i] >> x;
        m[a[i]] = x;
    }
    sort(a, a + n);

    // Integrate checkers with the maximum position of beacons
    int maxPosition = a[n - 1];
    check_large_position_range(maxPosition);
    check_extensive_dp_calculations(maxPosition, n);
    check_frequent_nonzero_checks(maxPosition);

    int dp[maxPosition + 1];
    for (int i = 0; i < maxPosition + 1; i++) {
        if (m[i] != 0) {
            if (i - m[i] - 1 >= 0)
                dp[i] = dp[i - m[i] - 1] + 1;
            else
                dp[i] = 1;
        } else
            dp[i] = i - 1 >= 0 ? dp[i - 1] : 0;
        ans = max(ans, dp[i]);
    }
    cout << n - ans << "\n";
}
```

### Explanation

- **Checker Placement:** Each checker function is called right after determining the maximum position of beacons. This ensures that the program detects performance bottleneck conditions early and avoids executing potentially expensive loops unnecessarily.
- **Effectiveness:** The checks are placed outside of tight loops to avoid introducing additional overhead during execution.
- **Utility for Fuzzing:** These checks serve as practical guards to warn of conditions that may lead to performance degradation, which is useful for stress testing the program with diverse inputs.
