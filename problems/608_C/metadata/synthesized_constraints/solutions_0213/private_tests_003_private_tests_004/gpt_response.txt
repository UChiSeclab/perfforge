=== Invariants Response ===
Based on the hit count analysis and the provided code, we can proceed through the tasks to identify potential performance bottlenecks and derive performance-characterizing invariants.

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Line-Level Hit Count Comparison**:
   - The slow run heavily hits the loop that iterates through beacon positions (lines 16-18 and lines 21-37) significantly more than the fast run. Specifically:
     - The loop at line 16 (iterating backward over all positions up to `max_right`) is executed 1,000,002 times for the slow input.
     - The loop at line 21 (iterating forward through positions) is executed 1,000,001 times for the slow input.

2. **Pinpointing Significant Hits**:
   - The backward loop (lines 16-18) is significantly hit due to the large value of `max_right` (1,000,000). This indicates iterating over a large search space.
   - The forward loop (lines 21-37) iterates over potential beacon positions, where most iterations involve checking and updating arrays.

3. **Interaction Analysis**:
   - The `power` array contains beacon power levels, and the nested update operations around `minimum_destroyed` and `no_of_ones_on_right` dictate the logic's complexity.
   - The bottleneck stems from iterating over a wide range (`max_right`), performing repeated checks and array updates.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the above analysis, we can derive the following natural language invariants that describe conditions under which the program may encounter slow performance:

1. **Invariant Related to Large Position Values**:
   - **Natural Language Description**: "If the maximum beacon position (`max_right`) is very large, the program may perform excessive iterations, leading to slow execution. This is particularly noticeable when `max_right` approaches the upper constraint."
   - **Threshold Consideration**: Since `max_right` can theoretically be up to 1,000,000 based on input constraints, consider a threshold where performance degrades significantly when `max_right` is close to this upper bound.

2. **Invariant Related to Dense Activation**:
   - **Natural Language Description**: "If a significant portion of beacons have non-zero power levels close to their positions, the algorithm may incur additional overhead in maintaining or updating state arrays, resulting in performance slowdown."
   - **Threshold Consideration**: Consider scenarios where a large proportion of the positions up to `max_right` have associated power levels (`power[i] > 0`), leading to repeated state maintenance.

3. **Invariant Related to Array Operations**:
   - **Natural Language Description**: "When the program needs to iterate over and update state arrays across a large range of positions, it might experience slowed performance due to the repeated computation and memory handling."
   - **Threshold Consideration**: Conditions where loops iterate over nearly the entire possible range of positions (close to `max_right`).

These invariants generalize the conditions under which the program may slow down, allowing for identification of potential performance issues without relying on specific input values. They focus on characteristics such as maximum position values and beacon density, which are key performance drivers in the provided C program.

### Phase 3: Implement the Natural Language Invariants in C++

For each of the performance-characterizing invariants derived previously, here is the corresponding C++ checker code:

1. **Invariant Related to Large Position Values**:
   ```cpp
   void check_large_position_invariant(long long int max_right) {
       if (max_right > 900000) { // Threshold chosen near the upper bound
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large maximum position value!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Invariant Related to Dense Activation**:
   ```cpp
   void check_dense_activation_invariant(long long int n_actual_beacons, long long int n_effective_beacons) {
       if (static_cast<double>(n_effective_beacons) / n_actual_beacons > 0.8) { // Threshold set to 80% active beacons
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - dense activation of beacons!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Invariant Related to Array Operations**:
   ```cpp
   void check_array_operation_invariant(long long int max_right) {
       if (max_right > 900000) { // Use similar threshold to large position invariant
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive array operations!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Integrate Checker Code into Original Program

Below is the instrumented C++ code with the checker code integrated at the appropriate points. The checks are placed to ensure they do not add overhead inside tight loops.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Checker for large maximum position value
void check_large_position_invariant(long long int max_right) {
    if (max_right > 900000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large maximum position value!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Checker for dense activation of beacons
void check_dense_activation_invariant(long long int n_actual_beacons, long long int n_effective_beacons) {
    if (static_cast<double>(n_effective_beacons) / n_actual_beacons > 0.8) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - dense activation of beacons!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Checker for excessive array operations
void check_array_operation_invariant(long long int max_right) {
    if (max_right > 900000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive array operations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

long long int no_of_ones_on_right[1000010];
long long int minimum_destroyed[1000010];
long long int power[1000010] = {0};

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    long long int n, a, b, max_right = 0, n_right, n_destroyed;
    cin >> n;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        cin >> a >> b;
        power[a] = b;
        max_right = max(max_right, a);
    }

    // Check the large position and array operation invariants after computing max_right
    check_large_position_invariant(max_right);
    check_array_operation_invariant(max_right);

    n_right = 0;
    long long int n_effective_beacons = 0;
    for (int i = max_right; i >= 0; i--) {
        no_of_ones_on_right[i] = n_right;
        if (power[i] > 0) {
            n_right++;
            n_effective_beacons++;
        }
    }

    // Check dense activation invariant after counting effective beacons
    check_dense_activation_invariant(n, n_effective_beacons);

    minimum_destroyed[0] = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= max_right; i++) {
        if (power[i] > 0) {
            if (i - power[i] - 1 < 0) {
                minimum_destroyed[i] = n_right - no_of_ones_on_right[i] - 1;
            } else {
                minimum_destroyed[i] = 
                    (no_of_ones_on_right[max(0LL, i - power[i] - 1)] - no_of_ones_on_right[i] - 1) +
                    minimum_destroyed[max(0LL, i - power[i] - 1)];
            }
        } else {
            minimum_destroyed[i] = minimum_destroyed[i - 1];
        }
    }

    long long int ans = LONG_MAX;
    for (int i = 0; i <= max_right; i++) {
        ans = min(ans, minimum_destroyed[i] + no_of_ones_on_right[i]);
    }
    cout << ans << '\n';
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation
- **Checker Placement**: Each checker is placed immediately after the computation that affects the corresponding invariant. This ensures the program catches potential bottlenecks without incurring unnecessary overhead during critical operations.
- **Thresholds**: The threshold values are chosen based on the constraints and probable performance degradation scenarios, ensuring the checks are both meaningful and not over-sensitive.
