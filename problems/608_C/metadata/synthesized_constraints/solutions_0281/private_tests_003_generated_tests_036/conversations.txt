system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

There are n beacons located at distinct positions on a number line. The i-th beacon has position ai and power level bi. When the i-th beacon is activated, it destroys all beacons to its left (direction of decreasing coordinates) within distance bi inclusive. The beacon itself is not destroyed however. Saitama will activate the beacons one at a time from right to left. If a beacon is destroyed, it cannot be activated.

Saitama wants Genos to add a beacon strictly to the right of all the existing beacons, with any position and any power level, such that the least possible number of beacons are destroyed. Note that Genos's placement of the beacon means it will be the first beacon activated. Help Genos by finding the minimum number of beacons that could be destroyed.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000) — the initial number of beacons.

The i-th of next n lines contains two integers ai and bi (0 ≤ ai ≤ 1 000 000, 1 ≤ bi ≤ 1 000 000) — the position and power level of the i-th beacon respectively. No two beacons will have the same position, so ai ≠ aj if i ≠ j.

Output

Print a single integer — the minimum number of beacons that could be destroyed if exactly one beacon is added.

Examples

Note

For the first sample case, the minimum number of beacons destroyed is 1. One way to achieve this is to place a beacon at position 9 with power level 2.

For the second sample case, the minimum number of beacons destroyed is 3. One way to achieve this is to place a beacon at position 1337 with power level 42.

assistant: ### Phase 1: Identifying Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

Upon comparing line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs, the following observations can be made:

1. **Initialization Loop (Lines 15-16)**:
   - The loop at line 15 iterates over `max_pos`, which becomes `1000002` in the slow input, causing `saved_to[i] = 0` (line 16) to be executed `1000002` times. For the fast input, it iterates only `4` times.
   - This indicates a potential bottleneck due to the large size of `max_pos`.

2. **Main Loop (Lines 22-34)**:
   - The loop at line 22 is executed `1000002` times for the slow input but only `3` times for the fast input.
   - Lines 23, 24, and 34 are executed `1000001` times for the slow input, indicating excessive checks for beacons in the map and updates to `max_saved`.

3. **Conditional Inside Main Loop (Line 32)**:
   - Line 32, which updates `saved_to[i]` when there's no beacon at position `i`, is executed `1000000` times in the slow input scenario. This suggests that the area of the number line being processed is vast, with many positions being checked for beacons unnecessarily.

### Phase 2: Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the analysis, here are the performance-characterizing invariants:

1. **Large Position Range Invariant**:
   - Natural Language Description: "When the maximum position of a beacon (`max_pos`) is significantly large relative to the number of beacons (`n`), the initialization and processing loops iterate excessively, leading to performance degradation."
   - This is particularly relevant when `max_pos` (maximum position + 1) approaches its theoretical maximum (1,000,001) with a small number of beacons (`n`), causing a vast number of unnecessary iterations over positions with no beacons.

2. **Sparse Beacon Distribution Invariant**:
   - Natural Language Description: "If beacons are sparsely distributed across a large range, the algorithm spends a lot of time processing empty positions on the number line, especially if the rightmost beacon is far from the majority of others."
   - This scenario occurs when there are few beacons with large gaps between them, causing excessive map lookups and updates for positions without beacons.

3. **Map Lookup Overhead Invariant**:
   - Natural Language Description: "When most positions on the number line have no beacon, frequent map lookups result in overhead, particularly in the loop that checks for existing beacons and updates saved states."
   - This is emphasized when the map's keys (positions with beacons) are sparse, leading to frequent negative checks in the loop, which slow down the computation.

These invariants highlight the critical conditions where the code's performance may degrade significantly, guiding optimization efforts or input management strategies for large test cases.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
There are n beacons located at distinct positions on a number line. The i-th beacon has position ai and power level bi. When the i-th beacon is activated, it destroys all beacons to its left (direction of decreasing coordinates) within distance bi inclusive. The beacon itself is not destroyed however. Saitama will activate the beacons one at a time from right to left. If a beacon is destroyed, it cannot be activated.

Saitama wants Genos to add a beacon strictly to the right of all the existing beacons, with any position and any power level, such that the least possible number of beacons are destroyed. Note that Genos's placement of the beacon means it will be the first beacon activated. Help Genos by finding the minimum number of beacons that could be destroyed.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000) — the initial number of beacons.

The i-th of next n lines contains two integers ai and bi (0 ≤ ai ≤ 1 000 000, 1 ≤ bi ≤ 1 000 000) — the position and power level of the i-th beacon respectively. No two beacons will have the same position, so ai ≠ aj if i ≠ j.

Output

Print a single integer — the minimum number of beacons that could be destroyed if exactly one beacon is added.

Examples

Input

1 9
3 1
6 1
7 4


Output

Input

7
1 1
2 1
3 1
4 1

7 1


Output

Note

For the first sample case, the minimum number of beacons destroyed is 1. One way to achieve this is to place a beacon at position 9 with power level 2.

For the second sample case, the minimum number of beacons destroyed is 3. One way to achieve this is to place a beacon at position 1337 with power level 42.

Solution (C++ code):
{solution}


assistant: ### Phase 3: Implementing the Natural Language Invariants in C++

Below are the checker functions derived from the previously identified natural language invariants:

```cpp
// Check if the maximum position is significantly large compared to the number of beacons
void check_large_position_range(int max_pos, int n) {
    if (max_pos > 100 * n) {  // Assumes a threshold where max_pos being 100 times n is large
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large position range compared to number of beacons!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Check if beacons are sparsely distributed
void check_sparse_distribution(int max_pos, int n) {
    if (n < 10 && max_pos > 1000000) {  // Assumes sparse distribution when beacon count is low relative to position range
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - sparse beacon distribution!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Check for excessive map lookups indicating performance overhead
void check_map_lookup_overhead(int max_pos, int n) {
    if (max_pos > 1000 * n) {  // Assumes excessive overhead if max_pos is significantly higher than n
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive map lookups!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrating the Checker Functions into the Original Program

Now, let's integrate these checks into the provided C++ program. We'll place the checks after input parsing and before the loops to avoid adding overhead within tight loops.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Checker functions for performance bottlenecks
void check_large_position_range(int max_pos, int n) {
    if (max_pos > 100 * n) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large position range compared to number of beacons!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_sparse_distribution(int max_pos, int n) {
    if (n < 10 && max_pos > 1000000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - sparse beacon distribution!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_map_lookup_overhead(int max_pos, int n) {
    if (max_pos > 1000 * n) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive map lookups!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

### Explanation:
- **Check Placement**: The checks are placed after reading inputs and determining `max_pos`, but before entering any loops, ensuring no additional overhead is introduced during the iteration.
- **Thresholds**: The thresholds used are arbitrary but reasonable given the problem constraints and the analysis from Phase 1. Adjustments can be made based on further profiling or domain knowledge.
- **Checks**: If any check triggers due to an extreme condition based on the invariants, it warns and aborts, helping identify potential performance bottlenecks during testing or fuzzing.
