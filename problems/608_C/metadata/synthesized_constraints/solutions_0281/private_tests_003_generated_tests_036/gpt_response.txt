### Phase 1: Identifying Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

Upon comparing line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs, the following observations can be made:

1. **Initialization Loop (Lines 15-16)**:
   - The loop at line 15 iterates over `max_pos`, which becomes `1000002` in the slow input, causing `saved_to[i] = 0` (line 16) to be executed `1000002` times. For the fast input, it iterates only `4` times.
   - This indicates a potential bottleneck due to the large size of `max_pos`.

2. **Main Loop (Lines 22-34)**:
   - The loop at line 22 is executed `1000002` times for the slow input but only `3` times for the fast input.
   - Lines 23, 24, and 34 are executed `1000001` times for the slow input, indicating excessive checks for beacons in the map and updates to `max_saved`.

3. **Conditional Inside Main Loop (Line 32)**:
   - Line 32, which updates `saved_to[i]` when there's no beacon at position `i`, is executed `1000000` times in the slow input scenario. This suggests that the area of the number line being processed is vast, with many positions being checked for beacons unnecessarily.

### Phase 2: Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the analysis, here are the performance-characterizing invariants:

1. **Large Position Range Invariant**:
   - Natural Language Description: "When the maximum position of a beacon (`max_pos`) is significantly large relative to the number of beacons (`n`), the initialization and processing loops iterate excessively, leading to performance degradation."
   - This is particularly relevant when `max_pos` (maximum position + 1) approaches its theoretical maximum (1,000,001) with a small number of beacons (`n`), causing a vast number of unnecessary iterations over positions with no beacons.

2. **Sparse Beacon Distribution Invariant**:
   - Natural Language Description: "If beacons are sparsely distributed across a large range, the algorithm spends a lot of time processing empty positions on the number line, especially if the rightmost beacon is far from the majority of others."
   - This scenario occurs when there are few beacons with large gaps between them, causing excessive map lookups and updates for positions without beacons.

3. **Map Lookup Overhead Invariant**:
   - Natural Language Description: "When most positions on the number line have no beacon, frequent map lookups result in overhead, particularly in the loop that checks for existing beacons and updates saved states."
   - This is emphasized when the map's keys (positions with beacons) are sparse, leading to frequent negative checks in the loop, which slow down the computation.

These invariants highlight the critical conditions where the code's performance may degrade significantly, guiding optimization efforts or input management strategies for large test cases.

=== Checker Response ===
### Phase 3: Implementing the Natural Language Invariants in C++

Below are the checker functions derived from the previously identified natural language invariants:

```cpp
// Check if the maximum position is significantly large compared to the number of beacons
void check_large_position_range(int max_pos, int n) {
    if (max_pos > 100 * n) {  // Assumes a threshold where max_pos being 100 times n is large
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large position range compared to number of beacons!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Check if beacons are sparsely distributed
void check_sparse_distribution(int max_pos, int n) {
    if (n < 10 && max_pos > 1000000) {  // Assumes sparse distribution when beacon count is low relative to position range
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - sparse beacon distribution!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Check for excessive map lookups indicating performance overhead
void check_map_lookup_overhead(int max_pos, int n) {
    if (max_pos > 1000 * n) {  // Assumes excessive overhead if max_pos is significantly higher than n
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive map lookups!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrating the Checker Functions into the Original Program

Now, let's integrate these checks into the provided C++ program. We'll place the checks after input parsing and before the loops to avoid adding overhead within tight loops.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Checker functions for performance bottlenecks
void check_large_position_range(int max_pos, int n) {
    if (max_pos > 100 * n) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large position range compared to number of beacons!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_sparse_distribution(int max_pos, int n) {
    if (n < 10 && max_pos > 1000000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - sparse beacon distribution!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_map_lookup_overhead(int max_pos, int n) {
    if (max_pos > 1000 * n) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive map lookups!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    map<int, int> positions_to_beacons;
    int max_pos = 0, n = 0;
    cin >> n;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        int position, power;
        cin >> position;
        cin >> power;
        positions_to_beacons.insert(make_pair(position, power));
        max_pos = max(max_pos, position + 1);
    }

    // Insert performance checks here
    check_large_position_range(max_pos, n);
    check_sparse_distribution(max_pos, n);
    check_map_lookup_overhead(max_pos, n);

    int *saved_to = new int[max_pos + 1];
    for (int i = 0; i <= max_pos; ++i) {
        saved_to[i] = 0;
    }
    if (positions_to_beacons.find(0) != positions_to_beacons.end()) {
        saved_to[0] = 1;
    }
    int max_saved = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= max_pos; i++) {
        auto beacon_pair = positions_to_beacons.find(i);
        if (beacon_pair != positions_to_beacons.end()) {
            int power = beacon_pair->second;
            if (power - i >= 0) {
                saved_to[i] = 1;
            } else {
                saved_to[i] = saved_to[i - power - 1] + 1;
            }
        } else {
            saved_to[i] = saved_to[i - 1];
        }
        max_saved = max(saved_to[i], max_saved);
    }
    int destroyed = n - max_saved;
    cout << destroyed << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Check Placement**: The checks are placed after reading inputs and determining `max_pos`, but before entering any loops, ensuring no additional overhead is introduced during the iteration.
- **Thresholds**: The thresholds used are arbitrary but reasonable given the problem constraints and the analysis from Phase 1. Adjustments can be made based on further profiling or domain knowledge.
- **Checks**: If any check triggers due to an extreme condition based on the invariants, it warns and aborts, helping identify potential performance bottlenecks during testing or fuzzing.
