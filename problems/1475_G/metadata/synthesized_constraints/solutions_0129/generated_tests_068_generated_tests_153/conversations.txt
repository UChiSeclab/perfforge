system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

Polycarp found on the street an array a of n elements.

Polycarp invented his criterion for the beauty of an array. He calls an array a beautiful if at least one of the following conditions must be met for each different pair of indices i ≠ j: 

  * a_i is divisible by a_j; 
  * or a_j is divisible by a_i. 



For example, if: 

  * n=5 and a=[7, 9, 3, 14, 63], then the a array is not beautiful (for i=4 and j=2, none of the conditions above is met); 
  * n=3 and a=[2, 14, 42], then the a array is beautiful; 
  * n=4 and a=[45, 9, 3, 18], then the a array is not beautiful (for i=1 and j=4 none of the conditions above is met); 



Ugly arrays upset Polycarp, so he wants to remove some elements from the array a so that it becomes beautiful. Help Polycarp determine the smallest number of elements to remove to make the array a beautiful.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10) — the number of test cases. Then t test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) — the length of the array a.

The second line of each test case contains n numbers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) — elements of the array a.

Output

For each test case output one integer — the minimum number of elements that must be removed to make the array a beautiful.

Example

Input


4
5
7 9 3 14 63
3
2 14 42
4
45 9 3 18
3
2 2 8


Output


2
0
1
0

Note

In the first test case, removing 7 and 14 will make array a beautiful.

In the second test case, the array a is already beautiful.

In the third test case, removing one of the elements 45 or 18 will make the array a beautiful.

In the fourth test case, the array a is beautiful.

assistant: ### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Line-Level Hit Count Analysis:**
   - **Line 27 (`For(i,1,200000)`):** This loop runs for every number from 1 to 200,000 regardless of n, which can be inefficient if n is small.
   - **Line 29 (`For(j,2,200000/i) f[i*j]=Max(f[i*j],f[i]+a[i*j]);`):** This inner loop computes a maximum value which depends on divisors. The high hit count indicates this loop is a significant contributor to execution time, as it involves multiple calculations for each i.

2. **Interaction with Data Structures:**
   - The array `f` is updated in nested loops with a range potentially as large as 200,000. This suggests a time complexity that heavily relies on the number of divisors for each i, leading to high computational overhead especially when i has many divisors.

3. **Specific Observations:**
   - The line `f[i*j]=Max(f[i*j],f[i]+a[i*j]);` has extremely high hit counts, suggesting that the loop is revisiting elements of `f` many times, leading to inefficiencies.
   - Line 24 and Line 26 are straightforward initializations but are hit frequently due to their large loop size.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **Invariant #1: Large Number of Divisors**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "When the array contains integers with a large number of divisors, the program's performance can degrade due to frequent updates and checks across a broad range of indices."
   - This happens because, for numbers with many divisors, the inner loop in Line 29 has to execute many times, leading to increased computational time.

2. **Invariant #2: High Range Initialization**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "Initialization loops that cover the entire possible number range can lead to performance issues, especially when the actual input size n is much smaller."
   - The repeated initialization of arrays `a` and `f` over a large fixed range (200,000) irrespective of n leads to unnecessary computations.

3. **Invariant #3: High Update Frequency on `f`**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "If the array `f` is updated frequently across many indices due to a dense set of input numbers, the cumulative effect can slow down the program significantly."
   - This reflects the repeated recalculation of maximum values in the nested loops, which becomes maximal when dense input numbers have many divisors.

### Recommendations for Optimization:

- Consider modifying loops to adapt based on actual input size n rather than fixed maximums.
- Optimize the inner loop to avoid redundant calculations, possibly by skipping unnecessary updates or reducing the number of divisor checks needed.
- Use data structures that efficiently track and compute necessary conditions only for indices relevant per input scenario.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
Polycarp found on the street an array a of n elements.

Polycarp invented his criterion for the beauty of an array. He calls an array a beautiful if at least one of the following conditions must be met for each different pair of indices i ≠ j: 

  * a_i is divisible by a_j; 
  * or a_j is divisible by a_i. 



For example, if: 

  * n=5 and a=[7, 9, 3, 14, 63], then the a array is not beautiful (for i=4 and j=2, none of the conditions above is met); 
  * n=3 and a=[2, 14, 42], then the a array is beautiful; 
  * n=4 and a=[45, 9, 3, 18], then the a array is not beautiful (for i=1 and j=4 none of the conditions above is met); 



Ugly arrays upset Polycarp, so he wants to remove some elements from the array a so that it becomes beautiful. Help Polycarp determine the smallest number of elements to remove to make the array a beautiful.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10) — the number of test cases. Then t test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) — the length of the array a.

The second line of each test case contains n numbers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) — elements of the array a.

Output

For each test case output one integer — the minimum number of elements that must be removed to make the array a beautiful.

Example

Input


4
5
7 9 3 14 63
3
2 14 42
4
45 9 3 18
3
2 2 8


Output


2
0
1
0

Note

In the first test case, removing 7 and 14 will make array a beautiful.

In the second test case, the array a is already beautiful.

In the third test case, removing one of the elements 45 or 18 will make the array a beautiful.

In the fourth test case, the array a is beautiful.

Solution (C++ code):
{solution}


assistant: ### Phase 3: Implementing Invariants as Checker Functions

Here, I will present C++ functions that check the conditions identified in the performance-characterizing invariants.

```cpp
// Check if a number has a large number of divisors
void check_divisor_invariant(int number, int divisorCountThreshold) {
    int divisorCount = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= sqrt(number); i++) {
        if (number % i == 0) {
            if (i * i == number) { // Perfect square
                divisorCount++;
            } else {
                divisorCount += 2; // Pair of divisors
            }
        }
    }
    if (divisorCount > divisorCountThreshold) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to high number of divisors!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Check for excessive range initialization
void check_initialization_invariant(int n, int rangeThreshold) {
    if (n < rangeThreshold) {
        cerr << "Warning: Inefficient initialization for small n!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Check for frequent updates of f array
void check_update_invariant(int updateCount, int updateThreshold) {
    if (updateCount > updateThreshold) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to frequent updates!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrating Checkers into the C++ Program

Now we will integrate these checks into the original C++ program at appropriate places to ensure they catch potential performance issues without adding overhead in tight loops.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define N 200005
#define Max(x, y) ((x) > (y) ? x : y)
#define For(i, x, y) for (i = x; i <= (y); i++)
int a[N], f[N];

int read() {
    int A;
    bool K;
    char C;
    C = A = K = 0;

### Comments on Integration:
- **Initialization Invariant:** Checked once per test case after reading `n`, ensuring that the full 200,000 range initialization isn't wasteful for very small `n`.
- **Divisor Invariant:** Checked inside the main loop to ensure no single number has too many divisors, causing excessive computation.
- **Update Invariant:** Checked during the frequent update loop to ensure no excessive calculations occur for any `f[i * j]`.

These checks will help a fuzzer identify slow performance triggers by detecting and stopping execution when the defined conditions are met.
