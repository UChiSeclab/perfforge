system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

Let's call a non-empty sequence of positive integers a1, a2... ak coprime if the greatest common divisor of all elements of this sequence is equal to 1.

Given an array a consisting of n positive integers, find the number of its coprime subsequences. Since the answer may be very large, print it modulo 109 + 7.

Note that two subsequences are considered different if chosen indices are different. For example, in the array [1, 1] there are 3 different subsequences: [1], [1] and [1, 1].

Input

The first line contains one integer number n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000).

The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2... an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 100000).

Output

Print the number of coprime subsequences of a modulo 109 + 7.

assistant: ### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

#### Analysis of Hit Counts

1. **Lines with High Hit Counts on Slow Input:**
   - **Line 19:** `for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++)` is hit 100,001 times on slow input, compared to only 2 times on fast input.
   - **Line 20:** `for (int j = 2 * i; j <= n; j += i)` is nested inside line 19 and is hit 1,166,750 times on slow input, compared to 1 time on fast input.
   - **Line 21:** `mu[j] -= mu[i];` is part of the nested loop, hit 1,066,750 times on slow input and 0 times on fast input.
   - **Line 25:** `for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++)` again hit 100,001 times on slow input, similar to line 19.
   - **Line 27:** `for (int j = i; j <= n; j += i)` nested inside line 25, hit 1,266,750 times on slow input, compared to 2 times on fast input.
   - **Line 28:** `c += cnt[j];` is part of the nested loop, hit 1,166,750 times on slow input and 1 time on fast input.
   - **Line 30:** `ans = ((ans + mu[i] * (P[c] - 1) % MOD) % MOD + MOD) % MOD;` is hit 100,000 times on slow input and 1 time on fast input.

#### Potential Causes of Slow Execution
- **Nested Loops:** The high hit counts indicate computationally expensive nested loops, particularly those iterating over divisors of `n`. For large values of `n`, these loops get executed extensively.
- **Calculation of Moebius Function (`mu`):** The loops that update the `mu` array suggest that the process of computing values for many divisors is expensive.
- **Frequency Counting Subprocess:** The repeated iteration over elements to sum counts in `cnt` and calculate power sets also contributes to inefficiency when `n` is large.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **High Number of Divisors:**
   - **Invariant:** "When the maximum element in the array `a` is large, and thus has many divisors, looping over all divisors to compute Mu values and subsequence counts can lead to significant slowdowns."

2. **Nested Loops with High Iteration Counts:**
   - **Invariant:** "If the loops that process divisors iterate excessively due to a large value `n`, this results in high computational overhead, especially when calculating cumulative count and powers of 2."

3. **Calculation of Powers of 2:**
   - **Invariant:** "When there are repeated calculations involving powers of 2 on large sets of divisors, it can be computationally intensive, particularly if the divisor count approaches the input size constraint."

These invariants collectively highlight that the program slows down significantly when dealing with large numbers having multiple divisors, leading to extensive nested loop executions. Additionally, the calculation of subsequence counts based on these divisors adds to the computational load.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
Let's call a non-empty sequence of positive integers a1, a2... ak coprime if the greatest common divisor of all elements of this sequence is equal to 1.

Given an array a consisting of n positive integers, find the number of its coprime subsequences. Since the answer may be very large, print it modulo 109 + 7.

Note that two subsequences are considered different if chosen indices are different. For example, in the array [1, 1] there are 3 different subsequences: [1], [1] and [1, 1].

Input

The first line contains one integer number n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000).

The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2... an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 100000).

Output

Print the number of coprime subsequences of a modulo 109 + 7.

assistant: ### Phase 3: Implementing Performance-Characterizing Invariants in C++

Let's translate the natural language invariants into runtime checks in C++.

#### Invariant 1: High Number of Divisors
```cpp
void check_divisors_invariant(int maxElement) {
    int divisorThreshold = 10000; // Arbitrary threshold for example
    if (maxElement > divisorThreshold) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to high number of divisors!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

#### Invariant 2: Nested Loops with High Iteration Counts
```cpp
void check_nested_loops_invariant(int n) {
    int nestedLoopThreshold = 50000; // Arbitrary threshold for example
    if (n > nestedLoopThreshold) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to excessive nested loop iterations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

#### Invariant 3: Calculation of Powers of 2
```cpp
void check_power_calculation_invariant(int maxElement) {
    int powerCalculationThreshold = 15000; // Arbitrary threshold for example
    if (maxElement > powerCalculationThreshold) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to large power calculations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrating Checks into the Original Program

Integrate these checks at strategic points in the program flow.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
const int maxn = 100000 + 9;
const int MOD = 1000000007;
int N, n = 1;
int w[maxn], mu[maxn], cnt[maxn], P[maxn];

// Checkers for performance-characterizing invariants
void check_divisors_invariant(int maxElement) {
    int divisorThreshold = 10000; // Threshold for high number of divisors
    if (maxElement > divisorThreshold) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to high number of divisors!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_nested_loops_invariant(int n) {
    int nestedLoopThreshold = 50000; // Threshold for nested loop iterations
    if (n > nestedLoopThreshold) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to excessive nested loop iterations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_power_calculation_invariant(int maxElement) {
    int powerCalculationThreshold = 15000; // Threshold for large power calculations
    if (maxElement > powerCalculationThreshold) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to large power calculations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    cin >> N;

        n = max(n, w[i]);
        cnt[w[i]]++;
        P[i + 1] = 2 * P[i] % MOD;
    }

    // Invoke checkers after inputs are processed

    memset(mu, 0, sizeof mu);
    mu[1] = 1;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {

            mu[j] -= mu[i];
        }
    }

    int ans = 0;

### Explanation:

- **`check_divisors_invariant`:** This check is called after calculating the `n` from the input array, to ensure the maximum element does not lead to an excessive number of divisors.
- **`check_nested_loops_invariant`:** This check ensures that the input size `N` does not lead to excessive nested loop iterations.
- **`check_power_calculation_invariant`:** This check is called to ensure that the calculations related to power of 2 do not lead to performance bottlenecks.

Each check is strategically placed after the input is processed and before the main computations begin, ensuring minimal performance impact of the checks themselves.
