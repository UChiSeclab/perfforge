system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

Let's call a non-empty sequence of positive integers a1, a2... ak coprime if the greatest common divisor of all elements of this sequence is equal to 1.

Given an array a consisting of n positive integers, find the number of its coprime subsequences. Since the answer may be very large, print it modulo 109 + 7.

Note that two subsequences are considered different if chosen indices are different. For example, in the array [1, 1] there are 3 different subsequences: [1], [1] and [1, 1].

Input

The first line contains one integer number n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000).

The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2... an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 100000).

Output

Print the number of coprime subsequences of a modulo 109 + 7.

assistant: ### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

**Comparison of Line-Level Hit Counts:**

1. **Function `faspow`:**
   - **Line 6-13:** Significant difference in hits with 100,000 hits for slow input vs. 2 hits for fast input.
   - **Observation:** The function is repeatedly invoked with large values, indicating potential inefficiency in exponentiation.

2. **Nested Loops:**
   - **Line 20:** First loop iterates 100,000 times for the slow input.
   - **Line 21:** Inner loop has 1,166,749 hits for slow input. This indicates a substantial number of iterations, leading to inefficiency.

3. **Second Nested Loop:**
   - **Line 24-27:** Shows numerous iterations for the slow input (99,999 iterations).
   - **Line 26:** The inner loop has a large number of hits (1,066,749), suggesting redundancy in subtractions.

**Inference on Interaction with Data Structures:**

- The program appears to be heavily reliant on counting factors and computing power/modulo for large values, which becomes computationally expensive when `s` (max element) is high due to the nested loop structure.
- The repeated calls to `faspow` within `count` and nested loop structures suggest that the program's performance is sensitive to the maximum value of elements in the input array, more so than the size of the array itself.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **Invariant for Large Maximum Element:**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "When the largest element in the input array is close to the upper constraint, the program's operations involving nested loops over divisors become computationally expensive. The program's performance is heavily impacted by the maximum value rather than just the number of elements."
   
2. **Invariant for Repeated Exponentiation:**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "If the program repeatedly performs exponentiation with large exponents within loops, it can result in significant performance degradation. This is particularly true when computations involve exponentiating with values derived from large inputs."

3. **Invariant for High Factor Count:**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "When processing inputs with large elements, the program may repeatedly calculate divisors and manipulate large counts, leading to inefficiencies. This is exacerbated when large elements have many divisors."

By characterizing the performance impacts based on these abstract conditions, you will be better able to understand why certain inputs slow down the execution and potentially improve the performance by focusing on these specific areas.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
Let's call a non-empty sequence of positive integers a1, a2... ak coprime if the greatest common divisor of all elements of this sequence is equal to 1.

Given an array a consisting of n positive integers, find the number of its coprime subsequences. Since the answer may be very large, print it modulo 109 + 7.

Note that two subsequences are considered different if chosen indices are different. For example, in the array [1, 1] there are 3 different subsequences: [1], [1] and [1, 1].

Input

The first line contains one integer number n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000).

The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2... an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 100000).

Output

Print the number of coprime subsequences of a modulo 109 + 7.

{solution}


assistant: Below are the steps to transform the performance-characterizing invariants into runtime checks in C++ (Phase 3), followed by integrating these checks into the original C++ program (Phase 4).

### Phase 3: Implementing Invariants as C++ Checkers

**Invariant 1: Large Maximum Element**
- **C++ Code:** Check if the maximum element `s` is near the constraint limit.
  
```cpp
void check_max_element_invariant(long long max_element) {
    if (max_element > 90000) {  // Threshold chosen to be close to the upper constraint
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered! Maximum element is too large." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

**Invariant 2: Repeated Exponentiation**
- **C++ Code:** Check if exponentiation in `faspow` is done with large exponents repeatedly.

```cpp
void check_exponentiation_invariant(int exponent_count) {
    if (exponent_count > 100000) {  // Assume a significant number of calls indicate inefficiency
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered! Excessive repeated exponentiation." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

**Invariant 3: High Factor Count**
- **C++ Code:** Check if the number of divisor operations is excessively high.

```cpp
void check_factor_count_invariant(int factor_count) {
    if (factor_count > 1000000) {  // Arbitrary large threshold to indicate inefficiency
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered! Excessive factor counting operations." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrating Checkers into Original Code

The following is the instrumented version of the original C++ code with the performance checks integrated.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
const long long mod = 1e9 + 7;
int n;
long long f[100010], g[100010], s, sum, a[100010], v[100010];

// Checker for maximum element size
void check_max_element_invariant(long long max_element) {
    if (max_element > 90000) {  // Threshold chosen to be close to the upper constraint
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered! Maximum element is too large." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Checker for repeated exponentiation calls
void check_exponentiation_invariant(int exponent_count) {
    if (exponent_count > 100000) {  // Assume a significant number of calls indicate inefficiency
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered! Excessive repeated exponentiation." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Checker for excessive factor counting
void check_factor_count_invariant(int factor_count) {
    if (factor_count > 1000000) {  // Arbitrary large threshold to indicate inefficiency
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered! Excessive factor counting operations." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

long long faspow(long long a, long long b) {
    long long tmp = 1;
    int exponent_count = 0; // Count the number of exponentiation operations
    while (b) {
        if (b & 1) tmp = tmp * a % mod;
        b >>= 1;
        a = a * a % mod;
        ++exponent_count;
    }
    check_exponentiation_invariant(exponent_count); // Check for excessive exponentiations
    return tmp;
}

long long count(long long k) { return faspow(2, k) - 1; }

int main() {
    cin >> n;
    int factor_count = 0; // Initialize factor count
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        scanf("%lld", &a[i]);
        v[a[i]]++;
        s = max(s, a[i]);
    }
    check_max_element_invariant(s); // Check for large maximum element

    for (int i = 2; i <= s; i++) {
        for (int j = 1; i * j <= s; j++) {
            g[i] += v[i * j];
            ++factor_count; // Count factor operations
        }
    }
    check_factor_count_invariant(factor_count); // Check for excessive factor counting

    f[s] = count(g[s]);

**Explanation of Integration:**
- **Maximum Element Check:** Added after reading inputs to ensure early detection if the largest element is too large.
- **Exponentiation Check:** Integrated inside `faspow` to monitor if repeated exponentiation is causing a bottleneck.
- **Factor Count Check:** Performed after divisor calculations to ensure the loop does not process an excessive number of operations.
