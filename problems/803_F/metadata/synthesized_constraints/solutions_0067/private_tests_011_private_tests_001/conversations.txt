system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

Let's call a non-empty sequence of positive integers a1, a2... ak coprime if the greatest common divisor of all elements of this sequence is equal to 1.

Given an array a consisting of n positive integers, find the number of its coprime subsequences. Since the answer may be very large, print it modulo 109 + 7.

Note that two subsequences are considered different if chosen indices are different. For example, in the array [1, 1] there are 3 different subsequences: [1], [1] and [1, 1].

Input

The first line contains one integer number n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000).

The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2... an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 100000).

Output

Print the number of coprime subsequences of a modulo 109 + 7.

assistant: ### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

Based on the hit count information, we identify the following lines of code that have significantly higher hit counts for the slow input compared to the fast input:

1. **Line 6: `mpow` function call** - The `mpow` function is called with a high frequency (100,000 times for the slow input) and involves a loop for exponentiation, which can be computationally expensive.
   
2. **Lines 54-61: Loop and Operations** - The loop iterating from `mx` down to `2` is executed 100,000 times. Within this loop:
   - **Line 56: Inner loop** - It performs a linear scan for every possible divisor, leading to a large number of operations (1,166,749 iterations).
   - **Lines 57-58: Increment operations** - Accumulating `cnt` and `sub` contributes to the high hit count.
   - **Line 60: Another call to `mpow`** - This is repeatedly called with `cnt` as argument, further adding to the computational load.
   
These segments indicate that the slow performance is due to both the frequential use of the `mpow` function and the nested loop structure, particularly for large values of input elements (`mx`).

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **Exponentiation of Large Numbers of Elements**:
   - Natural Language Invariant: "If the program calls the `mpow` function with a large exponent frequently (such as when there are many unique numbers approaching the input constraints), it may significantly slow down."
   
2. **High Number of Divisors Computation**:
   - Natural Language Invariant: "When the maximum element `mx` is large, the loops that iterate over its divisors can become a bottleneck, especially if many numbers in the array are multiples of large numbers."
   
3. **Expensive Nested Loops for Multiple Subcomputations**:
   - Natural Language Invariant: "The nested loops that compute and adjust the count of subsequences, particularly when the number of operations scales with higher values of `mx`, may result in performance degradation."

These invariants effectively capture the conditions leading to slow execution, emphasizing scenarios with large maximum values in the input array and extensive computations involving power functions and nested loops. These insights provide a basis to predict and diagnose potential slowdowns for similar inputs in the future.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
Let's call a non-empty sequence of positive integers a1, a2... ak coprime if the greatest common divisor of all elements of this sequence is equal to 1.

Given an array a consisting of n positive integers, find the number of its coprime subsequences. Since the answer may be very large, print it modulo 109 + 7.

Note that two subsequences are considered different if chosen indices are different. For example, in the array [1, 1] there are 3 different subsequences: [1], [1] and [1, 1].

Input

The first line contains one integer number n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000).

The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2... an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 100000).

Output

Print the number of coprime subsequences of a modulo 109 + 7.

Note

In the first example coprime subsequences are: 

  1. 1
  2. 1, 2
  3. 1, 3
  4. 1, 2, 3
  5. 2, 3



In the second example all subsequences are coprime.

assistant: ### Phase 3: Implement the Natural Language Invariants in C++

Let's implement the performance-characterizing invariants identified in Phase 2 as runtime checks.

#### Invariant 1: Exponentiation of Large Numbers of Elements

```cpp
void check_exponentiation_invariant(long long cnt) {
    if (cnt > 50) { // Arbitrary threshold for when the number of unique elements is large
        cerr << "Warning: Exponentiation invariant triggered - large exponent in mpow." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

#### Invariant 2: High Number of Divisors Computation

```cpp
void check_divisors_invariant(long long mx) {
    if (mx > 50000) { // Threshold for the maximum element value where divisor loops become significant
        cerr << "Warning: Divisors invariant triggered - high number of divisor computations." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

#### Invariant 3: Expensive Nested Loops for Multiple Subcomputations

```cpp
void check_nested_loops_invariant(long long mx) {
    if (mx > 50000) { // Threshold for sum of divisors indicating heavy nested loop usage
        cerr << "Warning: Nested loops invariant triggered - heavy computation in loops." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrate Checks into the Original Program

Now we incorporate these checks into the original program to ensure they are triggered at appropriate points.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
const long long int mod = 1e9 + 7;
const int MAXN = 1e5 + 5;
long long int spf[MAXN];

long long int mpow(long long int x, long long int y) {
    long long int res = 1;
    x = x % mod;
    while (y > 0) {
        if (y & 1) res = (res * x) % mod;
        y = y >> 1;
        x = (x * x) % mod;
    }
    return res;
}

void sieve() {
    spf[1] = 1;
    for (long long int i = 2; i < MAXN; i++) spf[i] = i;
    for (long long int i = 2; i * i < MAXN; i++) {
        if (spf[i] == i) {
            for (long long int j = i * i; j < MAXN; j += i)
                if (spf[j] == j) spf[j] = i;
        }
    }
}

// Checkers for performance invariants
void check_exponentiation_invariant(long long cnt) {
    if (cnt > 50) {
        cerr << "Warning: Exponentiation invariant triggered - large exponent in mpow." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_divisors_invariant(long long mx) {
    if (mx > 50000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Divisors invariant triggered - high number of divisor computations." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_nested_loops_invariant(long long mx) {
    if (mx > 50000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Nested loops invariant triggered - heavy computation in loops." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);
    cout.tie(NULL);
    long long int T = clock();
    long long int n;
    sieve();
    cin >> n;
    vector<long long int> a(n);
    long long int mx = 0;
    set<long long int> s;
    map<long long int, long long int> mpp;
    for (long long int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        cin >> a[i];
        mx = max(mx, a[i]);
        s.insert(a[i]);
        mpp[a[i]]++;
    }
    
    // Check for divisor-heavy operations
    check_divisors_invariant(mx);
    
    long long int ans = mpow(2, n) - 1;
    vector<long long int> f(100005);
    for (long long int i = mx; i >= 2; i--) {
        long long int cnt = 0, sub = 0;
        for (long long int j = i; j <= mx; j += i) {
            cnt += mpp[j];
            sub += f[j];
        }
        
        // Check for large exponentiations
        check_exponentiation_invariant(cnt);
        
        f[i] = (mpow(2, cnt) - 1 - sub + mod) % mod;
        ans = (ans - f[i] + mod) % mod;
    }

    // Check for high computational loops
    check_nested_loops_invariant(mx);
    
    cout << ans;
    cerr << "\n\nTIME: " << (double)(clock() - T) / CLOCKS_PER_SEC << " sec\n";
    T = clock();
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of Instrumented Code

- **Check for Large Exponentiation**: We check if `cnt` is too large before calling `mpow`, which could lead to slow performance due to frequent large exponentiations.
- **Check for Divisor Heavy Operations**: This check is placed after reading the inputs and determining `mx`, to ensure the program does not proceed with a very large number of divisor computations.
- **Check for Nested Loops**: This check is placed to detect heavy use of nested loops with `mx`, indicating potential performance bottlenecks. 

Each check triggers a warning and aborts execution if the potential performance bottleneck conditions are met, helping to prevent costly operations under defined conditions.
