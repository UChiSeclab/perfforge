=== Invariants Response ===
To diagnose the performance bottleneck and derive performance-characterizing invariants, let's break down the provided code and its behavior under the given inputs.

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

**Analysis of Hit Counts:**

- The main performance difference between the fast and slow inputs is apparent in the loop (lines 7-14). The loop executes 1,000,000 times for the slow input (1 1), but only once for the fast input (2 1).
- The conditions in the loop (lines 9 and 12) are often not satisfied for the slow input, leading to repeated iterations.

**Code Segment Interaction:**

- The code uses a loop to decrement `n` by `p` and checks two conditions involving the `__builtin_popcount` and a simple comparison. The loop continues if these conditions are not met.
- For the slow input, both conditions fail to break the loop early, resulting in near-maximum iterations.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the above analysis, let's derive natural language invariants that might describe conditions resulting in slow execution:

1. **Invariant Related to Loop Execution:**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "When the value of `n` is such that repeated subtraction of `p` rarely satisfies the count of set bits or the condition `n < i`, the loop may iterate many times, causing slow execution."
   - **Reasoning:** This invariant highlights the situation where the operations within each loop iteration do not progress towards a loop exit condition quickly enough, resulting in excessive iterations.

2. **Invariant Related to Input Constraints:**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "When `p` and `n` are such that even after reducing `n` by `p`, the Hamming weight (`popcount`) of `n` remains high relative to the number of iterations, the computation may become unnecessarily prolonged."
   - **Reasoning:** This condition focuses on the inefficiency caused by the relationship between `n`, `p`, and the loop variable `i`. If `n` adjusted by `p` retains too many set bits, the loop continues longer.

3. **Invariant Related to Possible Impossibility:**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "If the conditions for representing `n` using `p`-binary numbers are inherently unsatisfiable, the program may resort to performing many unnecessary operations before concluding it's impossible."
   - **Reasoning:** The loop's structure may lead to extended execution times when the combination of `n` and `p` leads to an unsolvable scenario where no valid decomposition exists.

These invariants aim to encapsulate the situations that lead to slow execution without relying on specific numerical values from the inputs but rather on the general structure and behavior of the code. By observing these patterns, one can anticipate potential performance issues under similar input conditions.

=== Checker Response ===
Let's proceed with implementing the performance-characterizing invariants derived earlier into the C++ code.

### Phase 3: Implement the Invariants as C++ Code Checks

Below are the C++ code snippets for the invariants described in Phase 2. These snippets will check the conditions that might lead to performance bottlenecks.

```cpp
void check_loop_execution_invariant(int64_t n, int64_t p, int64_t i) {
    if (__builtin_popcountll(n) > i && n >= i) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive loop iterations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_popcount_invariant(int64_t n, int64_t p, int64_t i) {
    if (__builtin_popcountll(n) > i) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high popcount relative to iteration!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_impossibility_invariant(int64_t n, int64_t p) {
    if (n < p) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - inherently unsatisfiable scenario!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrate the Checkers into Original Code

Now, we'll integrate these checks into the given C++ program. We'll place these checks strategically to avoid adding overhead in tight loops.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

void check_loop_execution_invariant(int64_t n, int64_t p, int64_t i) {
    if (__builtin_popcountll(n) > i && n >= i) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive loop iterations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_popcount_invariant(int64_t n, int64_t p, int64_t i) {
    if (__builtin_popcountll(n) > i) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high popcount relative to iteration!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_impossibility_invariant(int64_t n, int64_t p) {
    if (n < p) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - inherently unsatisfiable scenario!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int32_t main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    int64_t n, p;
    cin >> n >> p;
    
    // Check for impossible scenario early
    check_impossibility_invariant(n, p);
    
    for (int64_t i = 1; i < 1e6; ++i) {
        n -= p;
        
        // Check potential performance bottlenecks
        check_loop_execution_invariant(n, p, i);
        check_popcount_invariant(n, p, i);
        
        if (__builtin_popcountll(n) > i) {
            continue;
        }
        if (n < i) {
            continue;
        }
        cout << i;
        return 0;
    }
    cout << -1;
}
```

### Explanation

1. **`check_loop_execution_invariant`:** This check ensures that if the loop iterates excessively without satisfying the exit conditions, a warning is triggered.
   
2. **`check_popcount_invariant`:** This check ensures that if the popcount of `n` remains high relative to `i`, indicating potential inefficiency, a warning is triggered.

3. **`check_impossibility_invariant`:** This check is invoked before entering the loop to catch scenarios that are inherently unsatisfiable, preventing unnecessary iterations.

These checks are integrated at points before or during loop iterations to detect and abort on conditions that could cause significant performance degradation.
