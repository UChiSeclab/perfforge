system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

Vasya will fancy any number as long as it is an integer power of two. Petya, on the other hand, is very conservative and only likes a single integer p (which may be positive, negative, or zero). To combine their tastes, they invented p-binary numbers of the form 2^x + p, where x is a non-negative integer.

For example, some -9-binary ("minus nine" binary) numbers are: -8 (minus eight), 7 and 1015 (-8=2^0-9, 7=2^4-9, 1015=2^{10}-9).

The boys now use p-binary numbers to represent everything. They now face a problem: given a positive integer n, what's the smallest number of p-binary numbers (not necessarily distinct) they need to represent n as their sum? It may be possible that representation is impossible altogether. Help them solve this problem.

For example, if p=0 we can represent 7 as 2^0 + 2^1 + 2^2.

And if p=-9 we can represent 7 as one number (2^4-9).

Note that negative p-binary numbers are allowed to be in the sum (see the Notes section for an example).

Input

The only line contains two integers n and p (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, -1000 ≤ p ≤ 1000).

Output

If it is impossible to represent n as the sum of any number of p-binary numbers, print a single integer -1. Otherwise, print the smallest possible number of summands.

Note

0-binary numbers are just regular binary powers, thus in the first sample case we can represent 24 = (2^4 + 0) + (2^3 + 0).

In the second sample case, we can represent 24 = (2^4 + 1) + (2^2 + 1) + (2^0 + 1).

In the third sample case, we can represent 24 = (2^4 - 1) + (2^2 - 1) + (2^2 - 1) + (2^2 - 1). Note that repeated summands are allowed.

In the fourth sample case, we can represent 4 = (2^4 - 7) + (2^1 - 7). Note that the second summand is negative, which is allowed.

In the fifth sample case, no representation is possible.

assistant: To analyze the performance bottleneck for the given C program, we will take the following steps:

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Compare Line-Level Hit Counts**:
   - The loop starting at line 11 has a significant difference in hit counts between the slow and fast inputs. For the slow input, it is executed 5,000,001 times, whereas for the fast input, it is executed only once.
   - Lines 12 and 13 are executed 5,000,000 times for the slow input but only once for the fast input.
   - The `continue` statement at line 14 is hit 5,000,000 times on the slow input but never on the fast input.
   
2. **Pinpoint Lines with More Hits**:
   - The loop at line 11 is the critical performance bottleneck. It iterates 5,000,000 times for the slow input, indicating inefficient computation for this test case.

3. **Inference on Data Structures, Loops, etc.**:
   - The computation repeatedly checks if `left < 1`, where `left` is `n - p * i`. For the input `1 1`, this condition is true for every iteration because `left` becomes negative as soon as `i` exceeds 1.
   - Given that the program continues whenever `left < 1`, the condition on line 13 is crucial for skipping unnecessary computations.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the analysis, we can derive the following performance-characterizing invariants in natural language:

1. **Invariant on Large Iterations**:
   - **Natural Language Description**: "If the product of `p` and `i` quickly exceeds `n`, resulting in `left` being negative for most iterations, the loop will execute its maximum number of iterations without finding a solution, leading to substantial slowdown."
   - **Explanation**: When `p` is positive and `n` is small, the loop runs to its full extent without finding valid `p-binary` numbers, as `left` becomes negative early on.
   
2. **Invariant on Condition Skipping**:
   - **Natural Language Description**: "If the `n - p * i` calculation frequently results in a negative value, the program will continually skip iterations, which may unnecessarily prolong execution."
   - **Explanation**: If `left < 1` is true for a high number of iterations, it indicates an inefficient computation path as many potential solutions are ignored.

3. **Invariant on Input Constraints**:
   - **Natural Language Description**: "For small `n` and relatively large positive `p`, particularly when the ratio `n/p` is less than 1, the program may iterate excessively without reaching a solution, causing performance issues."
   - **Explanation**: When the positive `p` causes `n - p * i` to be negative early, the loop may not terminate quickly, leading to inefficiency for a wide range of iterations up to 5,000,000.

These invariants are designed to help identify scenarios in which the code runs inefficiently without relying on the specific slow input values. Instead, they focus on generic conditions that lead to performance degradation.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
Vasya will fancy any number as long as it is an integer power of two. Petya, on the other hand, is very conservative and only likes a single integer p (which may be positive, negative, or zero). To combine their tastes, they invented p-binary numbers of the form 2^x + p, where x is a non-negative integer.

For example, some -9-binary ("minus nine" binary) numbers are: -8 (minus eight), 7 and 1015 (-8=2^0-9, 7=2^4-9, 1015=2^{10}-9).

The boys now use p-binary numbers to represent everything. They now face a problem: given a positive integer n, what's the smallest number of p-binary numbers (not necessarily distinct) they need to represent n as their sum? It may be possible that representation is impossible altogether. Help them solve this problem.

For example, if p=0 we can represent 7 as 2^0 + 2^1 + 2^2.

And if p=-9 we can represent 7 as one number (2^4-9).

Note that negative p-binary numbers are allowed to be in the sum (see the Notes section for an example).

Input

The only line contains two integers n and p (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, -1000 ≤ p ≤ 1000).

Output

If it is impossible to represent n as the sum of any number of p-binary numbers, print a single integer -1. Otherwise, print the smallest possible number of summands.

Note

0-binary numbers are just regular binary powers, thus in the first sample case we can represent 24 = (2^4 + 0) + (2^3 + 0).

In the second sample case, we can represent 24 = (2^4 + 1) + (2^2 + 1) + (2^0 + 1).

In the third sample case, we can represent 24 = (2^4 - 1) + (2^2 - 1) + (2^2 - 1) + (2^2 - 1). Note that repeated summands are allowed.

In the fourth sample case, we can represent 4 = (2^4 - 7) + (2^1 - 7). Note that the second summand is negative, which is allowed.

In the fifth sample case, no representation is possible.

Solution (C++ code):
{solution}


assistant: To implement the performance-characterizing invariants derived earlier, we will first create C++ checker code snippets based on the invariants, and then integrate these checkers into the original C++ program.

### Phase 3: Implement the Natural Language Invariants in C++

Here's the C++ code to implement the invariants as runtime checks:

```cpp
// Checker function for the first invariant
void check_large_iterations_invariant(long long n, long long p, long long i) {
    if (p > 0 && (n - p * i < 1)) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - loop iterates excessively without useful computation!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Checker function for the second invariant
void check_condition_skipping_invariant(long long left) {
    if (left < 1) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - skipping iterations excessively!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Checker function for the third invariant
void check_input_constraints_invariant(long long n, long long p) {
    if (p > 0 && n <= p) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - n is smaller than or equal to p, causing excessive iterations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrate Conditional Checks into the Original Program

Now, let's integrate these checks into the original C++ program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Checker functions
void check_large_iterations_invariant(long long n, long long p, long long i) {
    if (p > 0 && (n - p * i < 1)) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - loop iterates excessively without useful computation!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_condition_skipping_invariant(long long left) {
    if (left < 1) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - skipping iterations excessively!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_input_constraints_invariant(long long n, long long p) {
    if (p > 0 && n <= p) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - n is smaller than or equal to p, causing excessive iterations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int32_t main() {
    ios::sync_with_stdio(0);
    cin.tie(0);
    cout.tie(0);

    long long n, p;
    cin >> n >> p;
    
    // Check input constraints
    check_input_constraints_invariant(n, p);
    
    long long ans = 5 * 5000000;
    for (long long i = 1; i <= 5000000; i++) {
        long long left = n - p * i;
        
        // Check for large iteration invariant
        check_large_iterations_invariant(n, p, i);
        
        if (left < 1) {
            // Check for condition skipping invariant
            check_condition_skipping_invariant(left);
            continue;
        } else {
            long long k = __builtin_popcount(left);
            if (k <= i and left >= i) {
                cout << i;
                return 0;
            }
        }
    }
    cout << -1;
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

- **Checkers Integration**: Each checker is strategically placed in the program to monitor the conditions described by the performance-characterizing invariants. 
  - The `check_input_constraints_invariant` runs right after input is read to ensure `n` is not less than or equal to `p` when `p` is positive.
  - Within the loop, `check_large_iterations_invariant` is used to detect if the loop is likely to run excessively without finding a valid result.
  - The `check_condition_skipping_invariant` ensures that the loop does not skip too many iterations due to `left` becoming negative frequently.

These integrations help in identifying the inefficient paths during execution and provide early alerts for potential performance bottlenecks.
