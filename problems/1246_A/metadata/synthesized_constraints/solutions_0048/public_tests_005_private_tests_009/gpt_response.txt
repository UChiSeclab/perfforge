=== Invariants Response ===
To analyze the performance bottleneck for the given C program, we will take the following steps:

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Compare Line-Level Hit Counts**:
   - The loop starting at line 11 has a significant difference in hit counts between the slow and fast inputs. For the slow input, it is executed 5,000,001 times, whereas for the fast input, it is executed only once.
   - Lines 12 and 13 are executed 5,000,000 times for the slow input but only once for the fast input.
   - The `continue` statement at line 14 is hit 5,000,000 times on the slow input but never on the fast input.
   
2. **Pinpoint Lines with More Hits**:
   - The loop at line 11 is the critical performance bottleneck. It iterates 5,000,000 times for the slow input, indicating inefficient computation for this test case.

3. **Inference on Data Structures, Loops, etc.**:
   - The computation repeatedly checks if `left < 1`, where `left` is `n - p * i`. For the input `1 1`, this condition is true for every iteration because `left` becomes negative as soon as `i` exceeds 1.
   - Given that the program continues whenever `left < 1`, the condition on line 13 is crucial for skipping unnecessary computations.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the analysis, we can derive the following performance-characterizing invariants in natural language:

1. **Invariant on Large Iterations**:
   - **Natural Language Description**: "If the product of `p` and `i` quickly exceeds `n`, resulting in `left` being negative for most iterations, the loop will execute its maximum number of iterations without finding a solution, leading to substantial slowdown."
   - **Explanation**: When `p` is positive and `n` is small, the loop runs to its full extent without finding valid `p-binary` numbers, as `left` becomes negative early on.
   
2. **Invariant on Condition Skipping**:
   - **Natural Language Description**: "If the `n - p * i` calculation frequently results in a negative value, the program will continually skip iterations, which may unnecessarily prolong execution."
   - **Explanation**: If `left < 1` is true for a high number of iterations, it indicates an inefficient computation path as many potential solutions are ignored.

3. **Invariant on Input Constraints**:
   - **Natural Language Description**: "For small `n` and relatively large positive `p`, particularly when the ratio `n/p` is less than 1, the program may iterate excessively without reaching a solution, causing performance issues."
   - **Explanation**: When the positive `p` causes `n - p * i` to be negative early, the loop may not terminate quickly, leading to inefficiency for a wide range of iterations up to 5,000,000.

These invariants are designed to help identify scenarios in which the code runs inefficiently without relying on the specific slow input values. Instead, they focus on generic conditions that lead to performance degradation.

=== Checker Response ===
To implement the performance-characterizing invariants derived earlier, we will first create C++ checker code snippets based on the invariants, and then integrate these checkers into the original C++ program.

### Phase 3: Implement the Natural Language Invariants in C++

Here's the C++ code to implement the invariants as runtime checks:

```cpp
// Checker function for the first invariant
void check_large_iterations_invariant(long long n, long long p, long long i) {
    if (p > 0 && (n - p * i < 1)) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - loop iterates excessively without useful computation!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Checker function for the second invariant
void check_condition_skipping_invariant(long long left) {
    if (left < 1) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - skipping iterations excessively!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Checker function for the third invariant
void check_input_constraints_invariant(long long n, long long p) {
    if (p > 0 && n <= p) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - n is smaller than or equal to p, causing excessive iterations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrate Conditional Checks into the Original Program

Now, let's integrate these checks into the original C++ program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Checker functions
void check_large_iterations_invariant(long long n, long long p, long long i) {
    if (p > 0 && (n - p * i < 1)) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - loop iterates excessively without useful computation!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_condition_skipping_invariant(long long left) {
    if (left < 1) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - skipping iterations excessively!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_input_constraints_invariant(long long n, long long p) {
    if (p > 0 && n <= p) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - n is smaller than or equal to p, causing excessive iterations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int32_t main() {
    ios::sync_with_stdio(0);
    cin.tie(0);
    cout.tie(0);

    long long n, p;
    cin >> n >> p;
    
    // Check input constraints
    check_input_constraints_invariant(n, p);
    
    long long ans = 5 * 5000000;
    for (long long i = 1; i <= 5000000; i++) {
        long long left = n - p * i;
        
        // Check for large iteration invariant
        check_large_iterations_invariant(n, p, i);
        
        if (left < 1) {
            // Check for condition skipping invariant
            check_condition_skipping_invariant(left);
            continue;
        } else {
            long long k = __builtin_popcount(left);
            if (k <= i and left >= i) {
                cout << i;
                return 0;
            }
        }
    }
    cout << -1;
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

- **Checkers Integration**: Each checker is strategically placed in the program to monitor the conditions described by the performance-characterizing invariants. 
  - The `check_input_constraints_invariant` runs right after input is read to ensure `n` is not less than or equal to `p` when `p` is positive.
  - Within the loop, `check_large_iterations_invariant` is used to detect if the loop is likely to run excessively without finding a valid result.
  - The `check_condition_skipping_invariant` ensures that the loop does not skip too many iterations due to `left` becoming negative frequently.

These integrations help in identifying the inefficient paths during execution and provide early alerts for potential performance bottlenecks.
