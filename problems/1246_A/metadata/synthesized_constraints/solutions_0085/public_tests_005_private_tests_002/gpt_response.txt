=== Invariants Response ===
To analyze the performance of the provided C program and identify conditions that lead to slower execution times, let's follow the tasks outlined in Phases 1 and 2. 

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

#### Analysis of Hit Counts:

1. **Outer Loop (Line 22):** 
   - **Slow Input:** Executes 2,000,001 times.
   - **Fast Input:** Executes only once.
   - **Significance:** The outer loop is a major contributor to the slow performance since it iterates a large number of times for the slow input.

2. **Inner Loop (Line 25):**
   - **Slow Input:** Executes 82,000,000 times.
   - **Fast Input:** Executes 41 times.
   - **Significance:** The inner loop, nested within the outer loop, significantly contributes to inefficiency by iterating over 40 bits of `m`, potentially contributing to quadratic complexity with respect to some conditions.

3. **Conditional Check (Line 28):**
   - **Slow Input:** Evaluated 2,000,000 times.
   - **Fast Input:** Evaluated once.
   - **Significance:** This condition fails to satisfy early for the slow input, leading to the maximum iterations in both loops.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the analysis, the following natural language invariants are derived to describe conditions likely causing slow execution:

1. **High Iteration Count in Outer Loop:**
   - **Invariant:** "If the condition to break out of the outer loop (i <= m) is rarely satisfied early in the loop iterations, the algorithm may enter a slow path. Specifically, when the decrement from `p * i` does not rapidly adjust `m` to meet the condition, excessive iterations occur."

2. **Significant Bit Manipulation:**
   - **Invariant:** "When `m` frequently maintains high bit values (leading to many `1s` in the binary representation), the inner loop iterates 40 times for each outer loop iteration. This results in excessive bit checking operations, slowing down the computation."

3. **Unfavorable Relationship Between `n`, `p`, and Loop Variables:**
   - **Invariant:** "If the combination of `n` and `p` results in an `m` value that remains large or negative for many iterations, the program is unable to meet the condition `(value <= i && i <= m)` early, leading to exhaustive execution up to 2,000,000 iterations."

### Conclusion

The condition for breaking the outer loop and the number of bits set in `m` are key determinants of performance. The slow input likely maintains an `m` that remains large or negative for far longer due to the interaction between `p` and the loop index `i`, causing the program to execute a vast number of unnecessary iterations.

These invariants provide insight into potential future inputs that could also trigger slowdowns, by maintaining these unfavorable conditions.

=== Checker Response ===
Let's proceed with implementing the performance-characteristic invariants as runtime checks in C++. 

### Phase 3: Implementing the Invariants as C++ Checks

1. **High Iteration Count in Outer Loop**  
   The outer loop executes up to 2,000,000 times. If `m` remains such that `i` rarely satisfies the condition `i <= m`, we can suspect a bottleneck.

   ```cpp
   void check_outer_loop_invariant(long long m, int i) {
       if (i > m) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition in outer loop - excessive iterations!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Significant Bit Manipulation**  
   When `m` has many bits set (1s in its binary representation), the inner loop iterates 40 times frequently. We should check if `m` has a high number of bits set often.

   ```cpp
   void check_inner_loop_bit_invariant(long long m) {
       int bitCount = 0;
       for (int j = 0; j < 40; ++j) {
           if ((m >> j) & 1) bitCount++;
       }
       // Assuming a threshold for "high" is more than 20
       if (bitCount > 20) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition in inner loop - high bit count in m!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Unfavorable Relationship Between `n`, `p`, and Loop Variables**  
   This checks whether the combination of `n`, `p`, and `i` results in an `m` that remains large or negative for many iterations.

   ```cpp
   void check_m_value_invariant(long long m, long long n, long long p, int i) {
       if (m < 0 || m > n) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to unfavorable m value!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Propagating and Integrating Checks into the Original Program

Now we will integrate these checks into the original C++ code, placing them strategically to avoid unnecessary overhead in tight loops.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

void check_outer_loop_invariant(long long m, int i) {
    if (i > m) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition in outer loop - excessive iterations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_inner_loop_bit_invariant(long long m) {
    int bitCount = 0;
    for (int j = 0; j < 40; ++j) {
        if ((m >> j) & 1) bitCount++;
    }
    if (bitCount > 20) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition in inner loop - high bit count in m!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_m_value_invariant(long long m, long long n, long long p, int i) {
    if (m < 0 || m > n) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to unfavorable m value!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

const int max_iterations = 2000000;

void solve() {
    long long n, p;
    cin >> n >> p;
    for (int i = 1; i <= max_iterations; i++) {
        long long m = n - p * i;
        
        // Insert checks before entering the inner loop
        check_outer_loop_invariant(m, i);
        check_m_value_invariant(m, n, p, i);

        long long value = 0;
        for (int j = 0; j < 40; j++) {
            if ((m >> j) & 1) value += 1;
        }

        // Insert check after calculating the bit value
        check_inner_loop_bit_invariant(m);

        if (value <= i && i <= m) {
            cout << i;
            return;
        }
    }
    cout << -1;
}

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
    cin.tie(nullptr);
    cout.tie(nullptr);
    solve();
}
```

### Explanation of Integration:

- Checks are placed strategically before and after significant computational steps to capture potential performance bottlenecks.
- This setup ensures that the checks are not within tight loops directly, thus minimizing the overhead while still providing effective performance warnings.
- Each check corresponds to a specific invariant identified in Phase 2, providing diagnostic output and aborting execution when a potential bottleneck is detected.
