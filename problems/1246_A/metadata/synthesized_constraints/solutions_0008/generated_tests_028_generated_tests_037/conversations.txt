system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

Vasya will fancy any number as long as it is an integer power of two. Petya, on the other hand, is very conservative and only likes a single integer p (which may be positive, negative, or zero). To combine their tastes, they invented p-binary numbers of the form 2^x + p, where x is a non-negative integer.

For example, some -9-binary ("minus nine" binary) numbers are: -8 (minus eight), 7 and 1015 (-8=2^0-9, 7=2^4-9, 1015=2^{10}-9).

The boys now use p-binary numbers to represent everything. They now face a problem: given a positive integer n, what's the smallest number of p-binary numbers (not necessarily distinct) they need to represent n as their sum? It may be possible that representation is impossible altogether. Help them solve this problem.

For example, if p=0 we can represent 7 as 2^0 + 2^1 + 2^2.

And if p=-9 we can represent 7 as one number (2^4-9).

Note that negative p-binary numbers are allowed to be in the sum (see the Notes section for an example).

Input

The only line contains two integers n and p (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, -1000 ≤ p ≤ 1000).

Output

If it is impossible to represent n as the sum of any number of p-binary numbers, print a single integer -1. Otherwise, print the smallest possible number of summands.

Note

0-binary numbers are just regular binary powers, thus in the first sample case we can represent 24 = (2^4 + 0) + (2^3 + 0).

In the second sample case, we can represent 24 = (2^4 + 1) + (2^2 + 1) + (2^0 + 1).

In the third sample case, we can represent 24 = (2^4 - 1) + (2^2 - 1) + (2^2 - 1) + (2^2 - 1). Note that repeated summands are allowed.

In the fourth sample case, we can represent 4 = (2^4 - 7) + (2^1 - 7). Note that the second summand is negative, which is allowed.

In the fifth sample case, no representation is possible.

(F) Program Solving the Problem Statement

#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int n, p;
  scanf("%d%d", &n, &p);
  for (int i = 0; i <= 1000000; i++) {
    int tmp = n - p * i;
    int cnt = 0;
    while (tmp) {
      cnt += tmp % 2;
      tmp /= 2;
    }
    if (cnt <= i && i <= n - p * i) {
      printf("%d\n", i);
      return 0;
    }
  }
  printf("-1\n");
  return 0;
}

} /* line 20 slow_hit_count: 0, fast_hit_count: 0 */


assistant: ### Phase 1: Analysis of Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Loop Iteration Comparison**: The main loop (line 6) executes 1,000,002 times for the slow input versus only 3 times for the fast input. This suggests the loop's termination condition isn't met quickly for the slow input.
   
2. **Binary Conversion While Loop**: The `while (tmp)` loop (lines 9-11) is hit approximately 21,951,426 times for the slow input compared to just 14 times for the fast input. This indicates heavy processing within this loop when `n` and `p` result in conditions that are not quickly satisfied.

3. **Conditions for Main Loop Exit**: The condition `(cnt <= i && i <= n - p * i)` (line 13) seems to be where the fast input quickly finds a valid `i` value, while the slow input iterates much more before reaching a conclusion, if at all.

### Phase 2: Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **Invariant on Large `i` Iterations**:
   - **Natural Language**: "When the coefficient `p` in the problem description is equal to or larger than the number `n`, the main loop may iterate over many values without finding a quick solution, leading to significant slowdown."
   - **Threshold Consideration**: This invariant considers scenarios where `p` impacts the calculation `n - p * i` such that `i` must grow large to satisfy any valid condition.

2. **Invariant on Binary Conversion**:
   - **Natural Language**: "If the temporary variable `tmp` derived from the expression `n - p * i` remains large across many iterations, the binary digit counting process (`while` loop) will execute significantly more times, slowing down the computation."
   - **Threshold Consideration**: This checks for situations where `tmp` does not reduce quickly, thus the `while` loop continues to engage more heavily due to higher binary value reductions.

3. **Invariant on Solution Impossibility**:
   - **Natural Language**: "For certain combinations of `n` and `p`, especially when `p` is positive and close to `n`, no representation as a sum of `p`-binary numbers is feasible, resulting in the program exploring a vast range of invalid solutions before concluding it's impossible."
   - **Threshold Consideration**: This invariant captures scenarios where the condition `(cnt <= i && i <= n - p * i)` cannot be satisfied due to the inherent properties of `n` and `p`, leading to exhaustive loop iterations.

### Conclusion

These invariants abstract the conditions under which the code exhibits slow performance, using patterns and thresholds derived from the logic of the program and the input constraints. They avoid relying on specific input values but rather describe the problematic input scenarios in a general form, aligning with the constraint \( n \leq 10^9 \) and \( -1000 \leq p \leq 1000 \). This abstraction helps in identifying potential future slow scenarios based on input patterns.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
Vasya will fancy any number as long as it is an integer power of two. Petya, on the other hand, is very conservative and only likes a single integer p (which may be positive, negative, or zero). To combine their tastes, they invented p-binary numbers of the form 2^x + p, where x is a non-negative integer.

For example, some -9-binary ("minus nine" binary) numbers are: -8 (minus eight), 7 and 1015 (-8=2^0-9, 7=2^4-9, 1015=2^{10}-9).

The boys now use p-binary numbers to represent everything. They now face a problem: given a positive integer n, what's the smallest number of p-binary numbers (not necessarily distinct) they need to represent n as their sum? It may be possible that representation is impossible altogether. Help them solve this problem.

For example, if p=0 we can represent 7 as 2^0 + 2^1 + 2^2.

And if p=-9 we can represent 7 as one number (2^4-9).

Note that negative p-binary numbers are allowed to be in the sum (see the Notes section for an example).

Input

The only line contains two integers n and p (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, -1000 ≤ p ≤ 1000).

Output

If it is impossible to represent n as the sum of any number of p-binary numbers, print a single integer -1. Otherwise, print the smallest possible number of summands.

In the second sample case, we can represent 24 = (2^4 + 1) + (2^2 + 1) + (2^0 + 1).

In the third sample case, we can represent 24 = (2^4 - 1) + (2^2 - 1) + (2^2 - 1) + (2^2 - 1). Note that repeated summands are allowed.

In the fourth sample case, we can represent 4 = (2^4 - 7) + (2^1 - 7). Note that the second summand is negative, which is allowed.

In the fifth sample case, no representation is possible.

Solution (C++ code):
{solution}


assistant: ### Phase 3: Implementing Natural Language Invariants in C++

Let's implement the performance-characterizing invariants described in natural language as C++ runtime checks.

#### Invariant 1: Large `i` Iterations

```cpp
void check_large_i_invariant(int i, int n, int p) {
    if (p > 0 && i > n / p) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large i due to n being close to or smaller than p!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

#### Invariant 2: Binary Conversion

```cpp
void check_large_tmp_invariant(int tmp) {
    if (tmp > (1 << 20)) {  // Example threshold; adjust based on understanding of tmp's potential size
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large tmp leading to excessive binary conversion!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

#### Invariant 3: Impossibility Check

```cpp
void check_impossible_condition(int cnt, int i, int tmp, int n, int p) {
    if (i >= n && cnt > i && tmp < 0) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - impossible conditions due to high p!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrating Checkers into the Original C++ Code

Now, we integrate these checks into the given program. We'll place them strategically to avoid adding overhead in tight loops.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Checker functions for performance bottlenecks
void check_large_i_invariant(int i, int n, int p) {
    if (p > 0 && i > n / p) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large i due to n being close to or smaller than p!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_large_tmp_invariant(int tmp) {
    if (tmp > (1 << 20)) {  // Example threshold; adjust based on understanding of tmp's potential size
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large tmp leading to excessive binary conversion!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_impossible_condition(int cnt, int i, int tmp, int n, int p) {
    if (i >= n && cnt > i && tmp < 0) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - impossible conditions due to high p!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    int n, p;
    scanf("%d%d", &n, &p);

    for (int i = 0; i <= 1000000; i++) {
        check_large_i_invariant(i, n, p);  // Check for the large `i` invariant

        int tmp = n - p * i;
        check_large_tmp_invariant(tmp);  // Check for large `tmp` invariant

        int cnt = 0;
        while (tmp) {
            cnt += tmp % 2;
            tmp /= 2;
        }

        check_impossible_condition(cnt, i, tmp, n, p);  // Check for impossible condition

        if (cnt <= i && i <= n - p * i) {
            printf("%d\n", i);
            return 0;
        }
    }
    printf("-1\n");
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

- **`check_large_i_invariant`:** This function checks if `i` has grown too large relative to `n` and `p`, which might indicate a bottleneck due to excessive loop iterations.
  
- **`check_large_tmp_invariant`:** This function checks if `tmp` becomes excessively large, which might cause performance issues due to the binary conversion loop.

- **`check_impossible_condition`:** This function ensures that the program aborts when the conditions imply that a solution is impossible, preventing unnecessary iterations.

Each check is added outside tight loops to minimize performance impact, particularly before entering loops or after significant calculations. This approach helps in catching performance bottlenecks without introducing significant overhead.
