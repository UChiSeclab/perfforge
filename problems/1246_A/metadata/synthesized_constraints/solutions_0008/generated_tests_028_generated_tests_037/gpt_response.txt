### Phase 1: Analysis of Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Loop Iteration Comparison**: The main loop (line 6) executes 1,000,002 times for the slow input versus only 3 times for the fast input. This suggests the loop's termination condition isn't met quickly for the slow input.
   
2. **Binary Conversion While Loop**: The `while (tmp)` loop (lines 9-11) is hit approximately 21,951,426 times for the slow input compared to just 14 times for the fast input. This indicates heavy processing within this loop when `n` and `p` result in conditions that are not quickly satisfied.

3. **Conditions for Main Loop Exit**: The condition `(cnt <= i && i <= n - p * i)` (line 13) seems to be where the fast input quickly finds a valid `i` value, while the slow input iterates much more before reaching a conclusion, if at all.

### Phase 2: Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **Invariant on Large `i` Iterations**:
   - **Natural Language**: "When the coefficient `p` in the problem description is equal to or larger than the number `n`, the main loop may iterate over many values without finding a quick solution, leading to significant slowdown."
   - **Threshold Consideration**: This invariant considers scenarios where `p` impacts the calculation `n - p * i` such that `i` must grow large to satisfy any valid condition.

2. **Invariant on Binary Conversion**:
   - **Natural Language**: "If the temporary variable `tmp` derived from the expression `n - p * i` remains large across many iterations, the binary digit counting process (`while` loop) will execute significantly more times, slowing down the computation."
   - **Threshold Consideration**: This checks for situations where `tmp` does not reduce quickly, thus the `while` loop continues to engage more heavily due to higher binary value reductions.

3. **Invariant on Solution Impossibility**:
   - **Natural Language**: "For certain combinations of `n` and `p`, especially when `p` is positive and close to `n`, no representation as a sum of `p`-binary numbers is feasible, resulting in the program exploring a vast range of invalid solutions before concluding it's impossible."
   - **Threshold Consideration**: This invariant captures scenarios where the condition `(cnt <= i && i <= n - p * i)` cannot be satisfied due to the inherent properties of `n` and `p`, leading to exhaustive loop iterations.

### Conclusion

These invariants abstract the conditions under which the code exhibits slow performance, using patterns and thresholds derived from the logic of the program and the input constraints. They avoid relying on specific input values but rather describe the problematic input scenarios in a general form, aligning with the constraint \( n \leq 10^9 \) and \( -1000 \leq p \leq 1000 \). This abstraction helps in identifying potential future slow scenarios based on input patterns.

### Phase 3: Implementing Natural Language Invariants in C++

Let's implement the performance-characterizing invariants described in natural language as C++ runtime checks.

#### Invariant 1: Large `i` Iterations

```cpp
void check_large_i_invariant(int i, int n, int p) {
    if (p > 0 && i > n / p) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large i due to n being close to or smaller than p!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

#### Invariant 2: Binary Conversion

```cpp
void check_large_tmp_invariant(int tmp) {
    if (tmp > (1 << 20)) {  // Example threshold; adjust based on understanding of tmp's potential size
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large tmp leading to excessive binary conversion!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

#### Invariant 3: Impossibility Check

```cpp
void check_impossible_condition(int cnt, int i, int tmp, int n, int p) {
    if (i >= n && cnt > i && tmp < 0) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - impossible conditions due to high p!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrating Checkers into the Original C++ Code

Now, we integrate these checks into the given program. We'll place them strategically to avoid adding overhead in tight loops.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Checker functions for performance bottlenecks
void check_large_i_invariant(int i, int n, int p) {
    if (p > 0 && i > n / p) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large i due to n being close to or smaller than p!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_large_tmp_invariant(int tmp) {
    if (tmp > (1 << 20)) {  // Example threshold; adjust based on understanding of tmp's potential size
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large tmp leading to excessive binary conversion!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_impossible_condition(int cnt, int i, int tmp, int n, int p) {
    if (i >= n && cnt > i && tmp < 0) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - impossible conditions due to high p!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    int n, p;
    scanf("%d%d", &n, &p);

    for (int i = 0; i <= 1000000; i++) {
        check_large_i_invariant(i, n, p);  // Check for the large `i` invariant

        int tmp = n - p * i;
        check_large_tmp_invariant(tmp);  // Check for large `tmp` invariant

        int cnt = 0;
        while (tmp) {
            cnt += tmp % 2;
            tmp /= 2;
        }

        check_impossible_condition(cnt, i, tmp, n, p);  // Check for impossible condition

        if (cnt <= i && i <= n - p * i) {
            printf("%d\n", i);
            return 0;
        }
    }
    printf("-1\n");
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

- **`check_large_i_invariant`:** This function checks if `i` has grown too large relative to `n` and `p`, which might indicate a bottleneck due to excessive loop iterations.
  
- **`check_large_tmp_invariant`:** This function checks if `tmp` becomes excessively large, which might cause performance issues due to the binary conversion loop.

- **`check_impossible_condition`:** This function ensures that the program aborts when the conditions imply that a solution is impossible, preventing unnecessary iterations.

Each check is added outside tight loops to minimize performance impact, particularly before entering loops or after significant calculations. This approach helps in catching performance bottlenecks without introducing significant overhead.
