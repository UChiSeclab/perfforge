### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Analyze Hit Counts:**
   - The loop starting at line 17 (`for (int x = 1; x < 5000000; ++x)`) is executed 5,000,000 times in the slow input case, compared to just once in the fast input. This indicates that the loop condition is not satisfied until the very end for the slow input.
   - The line `long long m = n - p * x;` (line 18) and the conditional check `if (m >= x && count_bit(m) <= x)` (line 19) are both executed 4,999,999 times for the slow input, suggesting that the condition is rarely true in this scenario.
   - The function `count_bit` is called frequently during the fast input but not at all during the slow input, indicating its role is less critical to the slowdown.

2. **Inference on Data Structure and Operations:**
   - The loop's dependence on the variable `x`, which ranges up to 5,000,000, suggests the performance issue may stem from having to iterate excessively before finding a valid `x` that satisfies the condition.
   - The operations involving `n`, `p`, and `x` in calculating `m` and checking the conditions are likely computational bottlenecks, especially given the range of `x` and the dynamic nature of `n` and `p`.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **Invariant: Large Coefficient on `p` with Small `n`**
   - Natural Language Description: “If `p` is significantly larger than `n`, especially when `n` is small, the loop iteration count may become excessive, causing performance degradation. This is because the expression `m = n - p * x` remains negative or fails the condition for a large range of `x`.”
   - This captures scenarios where a small `n` and a relatively large `p` result in many iterations without satisfying the condition `m >= x`.

2. **Invariant: Loop Exceeds Practical Limits**
   - Natural Language Description: “When the loop count approaches its upper limit without finding a suitable `x`, the computation may slow down considerably. This is exacerbated when `p` influences `m` to remain less than `x` for many values.”
   - This invariant reflects the inefficiency when the loop's end condition (`x < 5000000`) is approached, indicating an impractical search space for the given conditions.

3. **Invariant: Insufficient Power Combinations**
   - Natural Language Description: “If combinations of `2^x + p` are insufficient to construct `n` through valid sums, the loop struggles to find satisfactory values, leading to increased execution time.”
   - This highlights the challenge when the mathematical formulation of `p-binary` numbers does not lend itself to easily forming `n`.

These invariants aim to capture the essence of the slow conditions by abstracting the specific values into broader categories that could cause similar performance issues in comparable scenarios.

### Phase 3: Implement the Natural Language Invariants in C++

Based on the natural language invariants derived previously, here are the C++ runtime checks to detect potential performance bottlenecks:

```cpp
void check_large_p_small_n(long long n, long long p) {
    // Invariant: Large Coefficient on `p` with Small `n`
    if (p > n) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large p with small n!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_loop_exceeds_limit(int x) {
    // Invariant: Loop Exceeds Practical Limits
    if (x >= 5000000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - loop count very high!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_insufficient_power_combinations(long long n, long long p, int x) {
    // Invariant: Insufficient Power Combinations
    long long m = n - p * x;
    if (x == 5000000 && !(m >= x && __builtin_popcountll(m) <= x)) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - insufficient power combinations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrate the Checker Code into the Original Program

Integrate the checks at appropriate locations in the control flow to avoid unnecessary overhead, ensuring that these checks help identify conditions leading to performance degradation without significantly affecting overall performance:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int count_bit(long long x) {
    if (x < 0) {
        return -1;
    }
    int ans = 0;
    while (x) {
        ans += (x & 1);
        x >>= 1;
    }
    return ans;
}

void check_large_p_small_n(long long n, long long p) {
    if (p > n) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large p with small n!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_loop_exceeds_limit(int x) {
    if (x >= 5000000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - loop count very high!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_insufficient_power_combinations(long long n, long long p, int x) {
    long long m = n - p * x;
    if (x == 5000000 && !(m >= x && __builtin_popcountll(m) <= x)) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - insufficient power combinations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    long long n, p;
    cin >> n >> p;
    
    // Insert check to detect large p with small n
    check_large_p_small_n(n, p);
    
    for (int x = 1; x < 5000000; ++x) {
        long long m = n - p * x;
        
        // Insert check to detect loop exceeding practical limits
        check_loop_exceeds_limit(x);
        
        if (m >= x && count_bit(m) <= x) {
            cout << x << endl;
            return 0;
        }
    }
    
    // Insert check to detect insufficient power combinations at loop's limit
    check_insufficient_power_combinations(n, p, 5000000);
    
    cout << -1 << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of Checker Integration

- **`check_large_p_small_n`:** Placed immediately after reading inputs to preemptively halt execution if `p` is significantly larger than `n`, which could lead to performance issues.
  
- **`check_loop_exceeds_limit`:** Placed inside the loop to trigger if iterations approach the upper limit without finding a solution, indicating inefficiency.

- **`check_insufficient_power_combinations`:** Placed after the loop, if it reaches the maximum without finding a solution, to warn about insufficient power combinations for given `n` and `p`. 

These checks are designed to help detect problematic input scenarios or loop behavior that could lead to performance bottlenecks.
