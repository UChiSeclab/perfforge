### Analysis and Performance Invariants

**Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments**

1. **Line-Level Hit Count Comparison:**
   - The function `calc` (lines 34-36) and the priority queue operations (lines 53-58) show significantly higher hit counts for the slow input compared to the fast input.
   - Specifically, the `calc` function has 431,132 hits for the slow input and only 17,124 for the fast input.
   - The loop in lines 54-58 iterates 21,212 times for the slow input compared to 844 times for the fast input.

2. **Inference on Code Interaction with Data Structures:**
   - The `calc` function is a computation-heavy operation used to determine the contribution of splitting a carrot into a specific number of pieces.
   - The priority queue is used to manage and iteratively optimize the distribution of carrot pieces among rabbits to minimize eating time.
   - The significant increase in hit counts for these segments under slow input suggests that more operations and checks are being performed due to the larger value of `k - n`.

**Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants**

1. **Invariant: High Number of Rabbits Relative to Carrots**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "When the number of rabbits is significantly higher than the number of carrots, the process of splitting carrots becomes computationally more expensive. This is particularly true when the difference (`k - n`) is large, as it leads to multiple iterations of distributing carrot pieces and frequently recalculating the optimal distribution."

2. **Invariant: Large Carrots Requiring Multiple Splits**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "If carrots are large and need to be divided into many pieces to accommodate the rabbits, the computational cost increases. This is especially costly when the priority queue is heavily utilized to balance large initial carrot sizes across more pieces than there are carrots."

3. **Invariant: Frequent Priority Queue Operations**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "Frequent operations on the priority queue, such as pushing and popping elements, can slow down the performance. These operations are intensified when the difference between `k` and `n` is large, requiring repeated adjustments to carrot allocations."

**Important Considerations**
- These invariants are designed to abstract conditions that lead to performance issues without relying on specific numerical values from the test inputs.
- The focus is on broad conditions that can be triggered by different input combinations within the problem's constraints.
- These statements help identify potential slow paths in the code and guide further optimizations or input handling strategies.

### Phase 3: Implementing the Invariants as C++ Checkers

Let's translate each of the performance-characterizing invariants derived in Phase 2 into C++ code for runtime checks.

1. **Invariant: High Number of Rabbits Relative to Carrots**
   ```cpp
   void check_rabbits_carrots_invariant(long long n, long long k) {
       if (k > 10 * n) {  // Example threshold: number of rabbits is more than 10 times the number of carrots
           cerr << "Warning: Potential performance bottleneck - number of rabbits significantly exceeds number of carrots!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Invariant: Large Carrots Requiring Multiple Splits**
   ```cpp
   void check_large_carrots_invariant(const vector<long long>& carrots) {
       for (auto length : carrots) {
           if (length > 100000) {  // Example threshold: carrot length needing excessive splits
               cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck - large carrot sizes requiring multiple splits!" << endl;
               abort();
           }
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Invariant: Frequent Priority Queue Operations**
   ```cpp
   void check_priority_queue_invariant(long long k, long long n) {
       if (k - n > 10000) {  // Example threshold: number of extra pieces required leading to many priority queue operations
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck - excessive priority queue operations due to large k - n!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Integrating Checkers into the Original C++ Program

Now, let's integrate these runtime checks into the given C++ program at appropriate locations to avoid adding unnecessary overhead.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#pragma GCC optimize("Ofast")
using namespace std;

// Checkers for performance bottlenecks
void check_rabbits_carrots_invariant(long long n, long long k) {
    if (k > 10 * n) {  // Example threshold
        cerr << "Warning: Potential performance bottleneck - number of rabbits significantly exceeds number of carrots!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_large_carrots_invariant(const vector<long long>& carrots) {
    for (auto length : carrots) {
        if (length > 100000) {  // Example threshold
            cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck - large carrot sizes requiring multiple splits!" << endl;
            abort();
        }
    }
}

void check_priority_queue_invariant(long long k, long long n) {
    if (k - n > 10000) {  // Example threshold
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck - excessive priority queue operations due to large k - n!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

inline long long calc(long long l, long long p) {
    long long b = l / p, t = l % p;
    return b * b * (p - t) + (b + 1) * (b + 1) * t;
}

struct cmp {
    bool operator()(const pair<long long, long long> &a,
                    const pair<long long, long long> &b) {
        return calc(a.first, a.second) - calc(a.first, a.second + 1) <
               calc(b.first, b.second) - calc(b.first, b.second + 1);
    }
};

void solve() {
    long long n, k;
    cin >> n >> k;

    // Insert checker for the number of rabbits relative to carrots
    check_rabbits_carrots_invariant(n, k);

    vector<long long> v(n);
    cin >> v;

    // Insert checker for large carrots requiring multiple splits
    check_large_carrots_invariant(v);

    // Insert checker for excessive priority queue operations
    check_priority_queue_invariant(k, n);

    priority_queue<pair<long long, long long>, vector<pair<long long, long long>>, cmp> pq;
    for (auto x : v) pq.push({x, 1});
    for (int i = 0; i < k - n; i++) {
        auto tp = pq.top();
        pq.pop();
        pq.push({tp.first, tp.second + 1});
    }

    long long ans = 0;
    while (!pq.empty()) {
        auto tp = pq.top();
        pq.pop();
        ans += calc(tp.first, tp.second);
    }
    cout << ans << '\n';
}

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(nullptr);
    long long T = 1;
    while (T--) {
        solve();
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of Integration Points:

- **After Reading Inputs:** The first two checkers are placed after reading the inputs to capture any potential performance bottlenecks early, such as when `k` is much larger than `n` or when carrot sizes are excessively large.
- **Before Priority Queue Loop:** The last checker is inserted before the loop that performs priority queue operations, ensuring we catch conditions that could lead to excessive operations due to the large difference between `k` and `n`. This avoids performance degradation by catching problematic scenarios early in the process flow.
