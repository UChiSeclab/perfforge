system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

There are some rabbits in Singapore Zoo. To feed them, Zookeeper bought n carrots with lengths a_1, a_2, a_3, …, a_n. However, rabbits are very fertile and multiply very quickly. Zookeeper now has k rabbits and does not have enough carrots to feed all of them. To solve this problem, Zookeeper decided to cut the carrots into k pieces. For some reason, all resulting carrot lengths must be positive integers.

Big carrots are very difficult for rabbits to handle and eat, so the time needed to eat a carrot of size x is x^2.

Help Zookeeper split his carrots while minimizing the sum of time taken for rabbits to eat the carrots.

Input

The first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ k ≤ 10^5): the initial number of carrots and the number of rabbits.

The next line contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6): lengths of carrots.

It is guaranteed that the sum of a_i is at least k.

Output

Output one integer: the minimum sum of time taken for rabbits to eat carrots.

Note

For the first test, the optimal sizes of carrots are \{1,1,1,2,2,2\}. The time taken is 1^2+1^2+1^2+2^2+2^2+2^2=15

For the second test, the optimal sizes of carrots are \{4,5,5,5\}. The time taken is 4^2+5^2+5^2+5^2=91.

assistant: ### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

After examining the hit counts, the following observations can be made:

1. **Function `f`:** This function has significant hit counts, with `f` being called 431,132 times in the slow run compared to 17,124 in the fast run. The key lines within this function, particularly lines 54-57, are hit frequently due to repeated calculations for each carrot piece. This is likely because this function computes the time taken for a rabbit to eat a carrot piece, which involves squaring operations and conditional checks.

2. **Priority Queue Operations:** The while loop that operates until `k != n` (lines 85-90) is executed 21,212 times in the slow case, compared to only 844 times in the fast case. This loop increases `n` to match `k` by adjusting carrot sizes efficiently, but the priority queue operations become costly when `k` is significantly larger than `n`.

3. **Comparison Function `cmp2`:** The function `cmp2` is used as a custom comparator for the priority queue and shows hit counts of 107,780 in the slow case and 4,278 in the fast case. This indicates the heavy use of this comparison logic when rearranging the queue.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the insights gained from the analysis, here are the potential performance-characterizing invariants:

1. **When `k` is significantly larger than `n`:**
   - *Condition:* The number of rabbits `k` greatly exceeds the number of initial carrots `n`.
   - *Natural Language Invariant:* "If the number of rabbits `k` is much larger than the number of carrots `n`, the repeated operations to balance carrot sizes among more rabbits can lead to increased computational overhead."

2. **High Frequency of Priority Queue Adjustments:**
   - *Condition:* The process of incrementally adjusting carrot piece sizes involves numerous operations on the priority queue structure.
   - *Natural Language Invariant:* "If the priority queue needs to be adjusted frequently because of a large difference between `n` and `k`, the program may experience slowdown due to extensive queue operations."

3. **Heavy Use of the `f` Function:**
   - *Condition:* The function `f` is invoked repetitively to calculate the time for each carrot piece, especially when `k` is large.
   - *Natural Language Invariant:* "If the function calculating time for eating each carrot piece is called repeatedly due to many small carrot pieces being created, the time complexity increases, resulting in slower execution."

4. **Comparator Complexity:**
   - *Condition:* The custom comparator for the priority queue is called extensively when rearranging the queue.
   - *Natural Language Invariant:* "Frequent comparisons to determine optimal carrot splitting can cause performance issues, especially when the number of operations in the priority queue increases."

These invariants abstractly capture conditions that lead to performance degradation without relying on specific data values from the inputs, focusing instead on the relationships and operations that exacerbate computational complexity.

2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
There are some rabbits in Singapore Zoo. To feed them, Zookeeper bought n carrots with lengths a_1, a_2, a_3, …, a_n. However, rabbits are very fertile and multiply very quickly. Zookeeper now has k rabbits and does not have enough carrots to feed all of them. To solve this problem, Zookeeper decided to cut the carrots into k pieces. For some reason, all resulting carrot lengths must be positive integers.

Big carrots are very difficult for rabbits to handle and eat, so the time needed to eat a carrot of size x is x^2.

Help Zookeeper split his carrots while minimizing the sum of time taken for rabbits to eat the carrots.

Input

The first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ k ≤ 10^5): the initial number of carrots and the number of rabbits.

The next line contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6): lengths of carrots.

It is guaranteed that the sum of a_i is at least k.

Output

Output one integer: the minimum sum of time taken for rabbits to eat carrots.

Examples

Input


3 6
5 3 1


Output


15


Input


1 4
19


Output


91

Note

For the first test, the optimal sizes of carrots are \{1,1,1,2,2,2\}. The time taken is 1^2+1^2+1^2+2^2+2^2+2^2=15

For the second test, the optimal sizes of carrots are \{4,5,5,5\}. The time taken is 4^2+5^2+5^2+5^2=91.

Solution (C++ code):
{solution}


assistant: ### Phase 3: Implementing Natural Language Invariants in C++

Here are the C++ code snippets to check each performance-characterizing invariant that we derived earlier.

#### Invariant 1: `k` is significantly larger than `n`

```cpp
void check_rabbits_carrots_ratio(long long n, long long k) {
    if (k > 10 * n) { // Arbitrary threshold to indicate significant disparity
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered! Too many rabbits for the number of carrots." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

#### Invariant 2: High frequency of priority queue adjustments

```cpp
void check_priority_queue_operations(long long numAdjustments) {
    if (numAdjustments > 10000) { // Threshold indicating excessive operations
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered! Excessive priority queue operations." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

#### Invariant 3: Heavy use of the `f` function

```cpp
void check_function_f_usage(long long functionCalls) {
    if (functionCalls > 100000) { // Threshold for excessive function calls
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered! Excessive calls to function f." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrating Runtime Checks into the Original Program

Now let's integrate the above checks into the original C++ code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

void mycode();
const long long int infLL = (1LL << 62);
const long long int mod = 998244353;

long long int ceil(long long int a, long long int b) { return (a + b - 1) / b; }
long long int min(long long int a, long long int b) {
  if (a > b)
    return b;
  else
    return a;
}

bool bit_check(long long int a, int i) {
  if ((a & (1LL << i))) return 1;
  return 0;
}

long long int bit_toggle(long long int a, int i) { return (a ^ (1LL << i)); }
long long int bit_sum(long long int a, int i) { return a + (1LL << i); }
long long int bit_sub(long long int a, int i) { return a - (1LL << i); }

long long int mod_power(long long int x, long long int y) {
  long long int p = mod;
  long long int res = 1;
  x = x % p;
  while (y > 0) {
    if (y & 1) res = (res * x) % p;
    y = y >> 1;
    x = (x * x) % p;
  }
  return res;
}

long long int power_of(long long int a, int b) {
  if (a == 0) return -1;
  return 1 + power_of(a / b, b);
}

long long power(long long int a, long long int b) {
  if (a == 1) return 1;
  long long int res = 1;
  while (b > 0) {
    if (b & 1) res = res * a;
    a = a * a;
    b >>= 1;
  }
  return res;
}

// Checker Functions
void check_rabbits_carrots_ratio(long long n, long long k) {
    if (k > 10 * n) { // Arbitrary threshold to indicate significant disparity
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered! Too many rabbits for the number of carrots." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_priority_queue_operations(long long numAdjustments) {
    if (numAdjustments > 10000) { // Threshold indicating excessive operations
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered! Excessive priority queue operations." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_function_f_usage(long long functionCalls) {
    if (functionCalls > 100000) { // Threshold for excessive function calls
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered! Excessive calls to function f." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(0);
  cout.tie(0);
  
  mycode();
  return 0;
}

long long int f(long long int v, long long int a) {
  if (v % a == 0)
    return (v / a) * v;
  else
    return (v % a) * ceil(v, a) * ceil(v, a) + (a - v % a) * (v / a) * (v / a);
}

bool cmp2(pair<long long int, long long int> a,
          pair<long long int, long long int> b) {
  if (a.first == b.first && a.second == b.second)
    return 0;
  else {
    long long int p1 = f(a.second, a.first), p2 = f(b.second, b.first);
    for (int i = 1; i < 5; i++)
      return (p1 - f(a.second, a.first + i)) < (p2 - f(b.second, b.first + i));
    return 0;
  }
}

void mycode() {
  long long int n, k, x;
  cin >> n >> k;

  // Check initial rabbits and carrots ratio
  check_rabbits_carrots_ratio(n, k);

  auto cmp = [](pair<long long int, long long int> left,
                pair<long long int, long long int> right) {
    return cmp2(left, right);
  };

  priority_queue<pair<long long int, long long int>,
                 vector<pair<long long int, long long int> >, decltype(cmp)>
      q(cmp);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> x;
    q.push({1, x});
  }

  unsigned long long int ans = 0, aa, bb, cc, a, b;
  long long numAdjustments = 0; // Counter for pq operations
  long long functionCalls = 0; // Counter for function f calls

  while (k != n) {
    n++;
    bb = q.top().first;
    cc = q.top().second;
    q.pop();
    q.push({bb + 1, cc});
    numAdjustments++;

    // Check priority queue operations
    check_priority_queue_operations(numAdjustments);
  }

  while (!q.empty()) {
    bb = q.top().first;
    cc = q.top().second;
    ans += f(cc, bb);
    functionCalls++;
    q.pop();
  }

  // Check function f usage
  check_function_f_usage(functionCalls);

  cout << ans << '\n';
}
```

### Explanation

- **Checker Functions:** Each performance invariant now has a corresponding function (`check_rabbits_carrots_ratio`, `check_priority_queue_operations`, and `check_function_f_usage`) that ensures the invariant is not violated at runtime. These functions issue a warning and terminate the program if a potential bottleneck is detected.

- **Placement:** The checks are placed strategically:
  - **After input reading:** For ratio checks between `n` and `k`.
  - **Inside/After relevant loops:** For tracking priority queue operations and function calls, ensuring they are frequently checked without causing significant performance overhead themselves.

This instrumented code will help detect conditions that might lead to performance degradation and could be useful for fuzzing or testing purposes.
