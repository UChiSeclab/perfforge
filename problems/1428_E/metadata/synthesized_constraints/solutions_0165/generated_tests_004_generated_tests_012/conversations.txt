system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

There are some rabbits in Singapore Zoo. To feed them, Zookeeper bought n carrots with lengths a_1, a_2, a_3, …, a_n. However, rabbits are very fertile and multiply very quickly. Zookeeper now has k rabbits and does not have enough carrots to feed all of them. To solve this problem, Zookeeper decided to cut the carrots into k pieces. For some reason, all resulting carrot lengths must be positive integers.

Big carrots are very difficult for rabbits to handle and eat, so the time needed to eat a carrot of size x is x^2.

Help Zookeeper split his carrots while minimizing the sum of time taken for rabbits to eat the carrots.

Input

The first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ k ≤ 10^5): the initial number of carrots and the number of rabbits.

The next line contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6): lengths of carrots.

It is guaranteed that the sum of a_i is at least k.

Output

Output one integer: the minimum sum of time taken for rabbits to eat carrots.

Note

For the first test, the optimal sizes of carrots are \{1,1,1,2,2,2\}. The time taken is 1^2+1^2+1^2+2^2+2^2+2^2=15

For the second test, the optimal sizes of carrots are \{4,5,5,5\}. The time taken is 4^2+5^2+5^2+5^2=91.

assistant: ## Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

### Analysis of Hit Counts

1. **Function `chk` and Line 27**:
   - The loop starting at line 27 is hit 702,092 times for the slow input, compared to only 31,445 for the fast input.
   - This loop is directly related to the number of iterations required to distribute the carrot pieces among the rabbits.

2. **Priority Queue Operations (Lines 28-34)**:
   - Lines 28-34, which involve priority queue operations, are executed a significantly higher number of times in the slow input. Specifically, `q.top()` and `q.pop()` are called 702,074 times in the slow run.
   - The expensive nature of these operations lies in repeatedly recalculating weights for the carrot pieces and adjusting the priority queue.

3. **Function `calc` (Lines 14-16)**:
   - Called 1,405,180 times for the slow input compared to 63,886 times for the fast input.
   - This function calculates the "eating time" for a carrot piece divided into `d` parts, which suggests the carrot division logic is critical to performance.

4. **Operator Overload (Line 10)**:
   - The overload for the `<` operator is hit 3,564,291 times in the slow input.
   - This indicates frequent comparisons for maintaining the priority order in the queue, which is exacerbated in the slow run.

### Inference
The primary source of inefficiency is the repeated manipulation of the priority queue in the function `chk`. The large difference in iterations between the slow and fast runs indicates that the conditions governing these operations are critical in determining the performance.

## Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

### Invariant #1: High Priority Queue Operations
- **Condition**: "When the number of additional pieces needed (`k - n`) is large relative to the number of carrots (`n`), leading to excessive priority queue operations."
- **Explanation**: The program slows down significantly when the difference between the number of rabbits and the number of carrots is large, resulting in many additional divisions and rearrangements in the priority queue. This leads to repeated recalculations and comparisons.

### Invariant #2: Repeated Weight Calculations
- **Condition**: "When the carrot lengths require frequent recalculations of potential division costs, especially when the lengths are such that division decisions frequently change."
- **Explanation**: The recalculation of weights (eating times) for carrot pieces drives performance degradation. If carrot lengths are such that small changes in division result in large swings in calculated time, the priority queue operations can become costly.

### Invariant #3: Large Recursion in Carrot Division Strategy
- **Condition**: "If the strategy for dividing carrots involves deep recursion or heavy iterative processing for each carrot."
- **Explanation**: A recursive or heavily iterative approach to determine optimal carrot length divisions results in high computational costs, especially when carrot lengths and their divisibility lead to complex decision trees.

### Conclusion
These invariants suggest that performance issues arise not just from the size of inputs but from the structure and divisibility of the carrot lengths relative to the number of rabbits. The priority queue operations become costly when these conditions push the algorithm into a state of frequent re-evaluation and adjustment.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
There are some rabbits in Singapore Zoo. To feed them, Zookeeper bought n carrots with lengths a_1, a_2, a_3, …, a_n. However, rabbits are very fertile and multiply very quickly. Zookeeper now has k rabbits and does not have enough carrots to feed all of them. To solve this problem, Zookeeper decided to cut the carrots into k pieces. For some reason, all resulting carrot lengths must be positive integers.

Big carrots are very difficult for rabbits to handle and eat, so the time needed to eat a carrot of size x is x^2.

Help Zookeeper split his carrots while minimizing the sum of time taken for rabbits to eat the carrots.

The first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ k ≤ 10^5): the initial number of carrots and the number of rabbits.

The next line contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6): lengths of carrots.

It is guaranteed that the sum of a_i is at least k.

Output

Output one integer: the minimum sum of time taken for rabbits to eat carrots.

Examples

Input


3 6
5 3 1


Output


15


Input


1 4
19


Output


91

Note

For the first test, the optimal sizes of carrots are \{1,1,1,2,2,2\}. The time taken is 1^2+1^2+1^2+2^2+2^2+2^2=15

For the second test, the optimal sizes of carrots are \{4,5,5,5\}. The time taken is 4^2+5^2+5^2+5^2=91.

assistant: ## Phase 3: Implement the Natural Language Invariants in C++

Below are the C++ code snippets implementing the performance-characterizing invariants derived earlier.

### Invariant #1: High Priority Queue Operations

```cpp
void check_priority_queue_operations(long long n, long long k) {
    if ((k - n) > 10000) { // Assuming a threshold based on typical usage patterns
        cerr << "Warning: High number of priority queue operations due to large k - n!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Invariant #2: Repeated Weight Calculations

```cpp
void check_repeated_weight_calculations(long long currentCalcCalls, long long threshold) {
    if (currentCalcCalls > threshold) {
        cerr << "Warning: Excessive recalculations of carrot division weights!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Invariant #3: Large Recursion in Carrot Division Strategy

```cpp
void check_deep_recursion(long long depth, long long maxAllowedDepth) {
    if (depth > maxAllowedDepth) {
        cerr << "Warning: Recursion depth too high in carrot division strategy!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

## Phase 4: Integrate the Checker Code with the Original Program

Now, let's integrate these checks into the original C++ code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
const int maxn = 233333;
long long n, k, sum;
long long a[maxn];

struct DD {
    DD() {}
    DD(long long _d, long long _l, long long _w) { d = _d, l = _l, w = _w; }
    long long d, l, w;
    bool operator<(const DD& b) const { return w < b.w; }
    void output() { printf("len: %lld d: %lld w: %lld\n", l, d, w); }
};

inline long long sqr(long long x) { return x * x; }

inline long long calc(long long l, long long d) {
    long long r = l % d, q = l / d;
    return r * sqr(q + 1) + (d - r) * sqr(q);
}

void check_priority_queue_operations(long long n, long long k) {
    if ((k - n) > 10000) { // Assuming a threshold based on typical usage patterns
        cerr << "Warning: High number of priority queue operations due to large k - n!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

bool chk(long long mid) {
    long long m = sum - mid;
    if (m <= 0) return true;
    priority_queue<DD> q;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        q.push(DD(1, a[i], calc(a[i], 1) - calc(a[i], 2)));
    }
    long long sz = k - n;
    check_priority_queue_operations(n, k); // Check for high priority queue operations

    DD cur;
    for (long long i = 1; i <= sz; ++i) {
        cur = q.top();
        q.pop();
        m -= cur.w;
        ++cur.d;
        cur.w = calc(cur.l, cur.d) - calc(cur.l, cur.d + 1);
        if (m <= 0) return true;
        q.push(cur);
    }
    return false;
}

int main() {
    cin >> n >> k;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        scanf("%lld", &a[i]);
    }
    sum = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        sum += a[i] * a[i];
    }
    long long le = 0, ri = 1e18;
    long long mid = (le + ri) >> 1;
    while (le < ri) {
        if (chk(mid)) {
            ri = mid;
        } else {
            le = mid + 1;
        }
        mid = (le + ri) >> 1;
    }
    printf("%lld\n", mid);
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Check for High Priority Queue Operations**: Added a check right after reading the input and calculating `sz = k - n` to ensure that if this difference is too large, it alerts the user and aborts the computation.
- The other invariants described potential inefficiencies that might arise in deeper recursions and repeated weight calculations, but these were less straightforward to implement given how the current algorithm is structured iteratively with priority queues. If the recursion depth becomes a concern, an additional check would be necessary when implementing a recursive version or deeper iteration strategy.
