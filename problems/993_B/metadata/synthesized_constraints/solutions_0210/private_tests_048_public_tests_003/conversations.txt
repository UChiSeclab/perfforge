system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

Two participants are each given a pair of distinct numbers from 1 to 9 such that there's exactly one number that is present in both pairs. They want to figure out the number that matches by using a communication channel you have access to without revealing it to you.

Both participants communicated to each other a set of pairs of numbers, that includes the pair given to them. Each pair in the communicated sets comprises two different numbers.

Determine if you can with certainty deduce the common number, or if you can determine with certainty that both participants know the number but you do not.

Input

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 12) — the number of pairs the first participant communicated to the second and vice versa.

The second line contains n pairs of integers, each between 1 and 9, — pairs of numbers communicated from first participant to the second.

The third line contains m pairs of integers, each between 1 and 9, — pairs of numbers communicated from the second participant to the first.

All pairs within each set are distinct (in particular, if there is a pair (1,2), there will be no pair (2,1) within the same set), and no pair contains the same number twice.

It is guaranteed that the two sets do not contradict the statements, in other words, there is pair from the first set and a pair from the second set that share exactly one number.

Output

If you can deduce the shared number with certainty, print that number.

If you can with certainty deduce that both participants know the shared number, but you do not know it, print 0.

Otherwise print -1.

1 2 4 5
1 2 1 3 2 3


Output

Note

In the first example the first participant communicated pairs (1,2) and (3,4), and the second communicated (1,5), (3,4). Since we know that the actual pairs they received share exactly one number, it can't be that they both have (3,4). Thus, the first participant has (1,2) and the second has (1,5), and at this point you already know the shared number is 1.

In the second example either the first participant has (1,2) and the second has (1,5), or the first has (3,4) and the second has (6,4). In the first case both of them know the shared number is 1, in the second case both of them know the shared number is 4. You don't have enough information to tell 1 and 4 apart.

In the third case if the first participant was given (1,2), they don't know what the shared number is, since from their perspective the second participant might have been given either (1,3), in which case the shared number is 1, or (2,3), in which case the shared number is 2. While the second participant does know the number with certainty, neither you nor the first participant do, so the output is -1.

assistant: ## Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

### Analysis of Hit Counts

By comparing the hit counts between the fast and slow inputs, we can pinpoint certain lines that are heavily hit during the slow input:

1. **Function `both`:** 
   - Lines 33 to 45 are executed 432 times on the slow input but only 12 times on the fast input.
   - Particularly, line 35 (the loop over `r`) is executed 4752 times on the slow input compared to 132 times on the fast input. This indicates that the function is being called in a nested manner multiple times.

2. **Function `solve`:** 
   - The loop in line 49 and its inner loop in line 51 are executed significantly more times on the slow input (13 and 156 hits respectively) than on the fast input (3 and 6 hits respectively). Similarly, the loop in line 62 and its inner loop in line 64 mirror this behavior.
   - This suggests that the nested loops over the pairs are a bottleneck, especially with higher input sizes.

### Inference

The slow performance can be attributed to the nested loops iterating over the pairs of numbers. Each combination of pairs from both participants is being checked in the `both` function, which itself contains a loop over possible numbers (0 to 9). This results in a significant number of operations, especially when `n` and `m` are large.

## Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

### Natural Language Performance Invariants

1. **Nested Loop Invariant:**
   - "When both participants communicate a large number of pairs, the program may slow significantly due to the high number of iterations needed to compare each pair combination."
   - **Threshold Suggestion:**
     - The slow path is likely when both `n` and `m` are near their upper limit (12), as the number of comparisons grows quadratically.

2. **Frequent Function Invocation:**
   - "The `both` function is called repeatedly for each pair combination, and each call iterates over a fixed range of numbers. If the number of pairs is large, this can lead to a bottleneck."
   - **Threshold Suggestion:**
     - The program encounters significant slowdowns when the product of `n` and `m` approaches the upper bound (e.g., when `n * m > 100`).

3. **Data Processing Complexity:**
   - "If the sets of pairs are such that there are many potential matches, the logic within loops may trigger frequently, causing slow performance."
   - **Threshold Suggestion:**
     - Performance may degrade when the input leads to multiple potential shared numbers, increasing the complexity of determining certainty in results.

By understanding these invariants, one can predict scenarios where the program might slow down and take action to either optimize the loops or reduce the number of unnecessary checks.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
Two participants are each given a pair of distinct numbers from 1 to 9 such that there's exactly one number that is present in both pairs. They want to figure out the number that matches by using a communication channel you have access to without revealing it to you.

Both participants communicated to each other a set of pairs of numbers, that includes the pair given to them. Each pair in the communicated sets comprises two different numbers.

Determine if you can with certainty deduce the common number, or if you can determine with certainty that both participants know the number but you do not.

Input

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 12) — the number of pairs the first participant communicated to the second and vice versa.

The second line contains n pairs of integers, each between 1 and 9, — pairs of numbers communicated from first participant to the second.

The third line contains m pairs of integers, each between 1 and 9, — pairs of numbers communicated from the second participant to the first.

All pairs within each set are distinct (in particular, if there is a pair (1,2), there will be no pair (2,1) within the same set), and no pair contains the same number twice.

It is guaranteed that the two sets do not contradict the statements, in other words, there is pair from the first set and a pair from the second set that share exactly one number.

Output

If you can deduce the shared number with certainty, print that number.

If you can with certainty deduce that both participants know the shared number, but you do not know it, print 0.

Otherwise print -1.

Examples

Input

2 2
1 2 3 4
1 5 3 4


Output

1


Input

2 2
1 2 3 4
1 5 6 4


Output

0


Input

2 3
1 2 4 5
1 2 1 3 2 3


Output

-1

Note

In the first example the first participant communicated pairs (1,2) and (3,4), and the second communicated (1,5), (3,4). Since we know that the actual pairs they received share exactly one number, it can't be that they both have (3,4). Thus, the first participant has (1,2) and the second has (1,5), and at this point you already know the shared number is 1.

In the second example either the first participant has (1,2) and the second has (1,5), or the first has (3,4) and the second has (6,4). In the first case both of them know the shared number is 1, in the second case both of them know the shared number is 4. You don't have enough information to tell 1 and 4 apart.

In the third case if the first participant was given (1,2), they don't know what the shared number is, since from their perspective the second participant might have been given either (1,3), in which case the shared number is 1, or (2,3), in which case the shared number is 2. While the second participant does know the number with certainty, neither you nor the first participant do, so the output is -1.

Solution (C++ code):

assistant: ## Phase 3: Implementing Performance-Characterizing Invariants in C++

Let's translate the previously derived natural language invariants into C++ runtime checks.

### Invariant Checks

1. **Nested Loop Invariant:**
   - Checker for when both `n` and `m` are large, leading to high loop iterations.
   
```cpp
void check_nested_loop_invariant(int n, int m) {
    if (n > 10 && m > 10) { // Considering upper bounds close to the maximum constraints
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to large n and m values!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

2. **Frequent Function Invocation:**
   - Checker for when `both` function is called excessively.

```cpp
void check_frequent_function_calls(int n, int m) {
    if (n * m > 100) { // Product of n and m suggesting excessive function calls
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to excessive function calls!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

3. **Data Processing Complexity:**
   - Checker for complex input leading to multiple potential shared numbers.

```cpp
void check_data_processing_complexity(const set<int>& oks) {
    if (oks.size() > 2) { // More potential shared numbers indicating complexity
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to input complexity!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

## Phase 4: Integrating Checkers into the Original Program

Now, let's integrate the checker snippets into the original C++ program at appropriate points to ensure they capture performance bottlenecks without adding significant overhead.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
using ll = long long;
using vi = vector<int>;
using vll = vector<ll>;
using vvi = vector<vi>;
using pii = pair<int, int>;

void check_nested_loop_invariant(int n, int m) {
    if (n > 10 && m > 10) { // Considering upper bounds close to the maximum constraints
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to large n and m values!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_frequent_function_calls(int n, int m) {
    if (n * m > 100) { // Product of n and m suggesting excessive function calls
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to excessive function calls!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_data_processing_complexity(const set<int>& oks) {
    if (oks.size() > 2) { // More potential shared numbers indicating complexity
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to input complexity!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

pii readp() {
    int a, b;
    cin >> a >> b;
    if (a > b) {
        swap(a, b);
    }
    return make_pair(a, b);
}

vector<pii> a;
vector<pii> b;

bool read() {
    int n, m;
    if (!(cin >> n >> m)) {
        return 0;
    }

    // Check for potential nested loop bottleneck before resizing arrays
    check_nested_loop_invariant(n, m);

    a.resize(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < int(n); ++i) {
        a[i] = readp();
    }
    b.resize(m);
    for (int i = 0; i < int(m); ++i) {
        b[i] = readp();
    }
    return 1;
}

int both(const pii& x, const pii& y) {
    vi ok;
    for (int r = 0; r < int(10); ++r) {
        int xx = (x.first == r) + (x.second == r);
        int yy = (y.first == r) + (y.second == r);
        if (xx == 1 && yy == 1) {
            ok.push_back(r);
        }
    }
    if (int((ok).size()) == 1) {
        return ok.front();
    }
    return -1;
}

int solve() {
    // Check for excessive function calls in solve logic
    check_frequent_function_calls(a.size(), b.size());

    bool a_know = 1;
    for (int i = 0; i < int(int((a).size())); ++i) {
        set<int> oks;
        for (int j = 0; j < int(int((b).size())); ++j) {
            int cur = both(a[i], b[j]);
            if (cur != -1) {
                oks.insert(cur);
            }
        }
        if (int((oks).size()) > 1) {
            a_know = 0;
        }
    }
    bool b_know = 1;
    for (int i = 0; i < int(int((b).size())); ++i) {
        set<int> oks;
        for (int j = 0; j < int(int((a).size())); ++j) {
            int cur = both(b[i], a[j]);
            if (cur != -1) {
                oks.insert(cur);
            }
        }
        if (int((oks).size()) > 1) {
            b_know = 0;
        }
    }
    set<int> oks;
    for (int i = 0; i < int(int((a).size())); ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < int(int((b).size())); ++j) {
            int cur = both(a[i], b[j]);
            if (cur != -1) {
                oks.insert(cur);
            }
        }
    }

    // Check for input complexity in final determination
    check_data_processing_complexity(oks);

    bool i_know = int((oks).size()) == 1;
    assert(!oks.empty());
    if (i_know) {
        return *oks.begin();
    }
    if (a_know && b_know) {
        return 0;
    }
    return -1;
}

int main() {
    cin.tie(0);
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cout.tie(0);
    while (read()) {
        cout << solve() << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:

- **Nested Loop Invariant Check:** Added right after reading the input to flag potential issues before processing heavy loops.
- **Frequent Function Calls Check:** Added at the start of the `solve` function to catch scenarios with excessive calls.
- **Data Processing Complexity Check:** Added at the end of `solve` before returning results to catch complex input cases. 

These checks are strategically placed to avoid adding unnecessary overhead to tight loops, ensuring effective detection of performance bottlenecks.
