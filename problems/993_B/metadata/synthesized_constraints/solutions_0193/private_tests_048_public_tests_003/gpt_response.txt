### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Comparison of Hit Counts**:
   - Lines 54 to 59 have significantly higher hit counts in the slow input compared to the fast input. Specifically:
     - **Line 54**: Iterates over pairs from the second participant's set. The hit count is notably higher in the slow input (1200 vs 40).
     - **Line 55-56**: Constructs `dwa` and `to_samo`, hit counts are also higher (2304 vs 64).
     - **Lines 57-59**: Contains nested loops iterating over elements in `jed` and `dwa`, with very high hit counts on the slow input (6912 vs 192).

2. **Inference on Interactions**:
   - The nested loops (`for` loops on lines 57 and 58) are expensive when both `z[0]` and `z[1]` have many pairs. The program performs a quadratic number of comparisons between pairs from the two participants, which is exacerbated in the slow input.

3. **Data Structure Interaction**:
   - The use of sets and repeated insertion operations (lines 44, 45, 62, 63) likely interact with these loops to amplify the slowdown. 

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Here are the natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down:

1. **Invariant for Pair Comparison**:
   - **Description**: "If both participants communicate a large number of pairs, the algorithm's nested loops will significantly increase comparisons, leading to a slowdown."
   - **Explanation**: The slow path is triggered when both `n` and `m` are large, near the upper constraint limit of 12, causing extensive iteration over their respective pairs.

2. **Invariant for Intersection Calculation**:
   - **Description**: "When each participant's communicated pairs contain many numbers in common, the intersection checks become extensive, slowing down the computation."
   - **Explanation**: The loops checking for intersections (`to_samo`) become a bottleneck if there are many potential shared numbers across the participant's pairs.

3. **Invariant for Redundant Insertion**:
   - **Description**: "Frequent insertion of elements into the `dobre` and `jdob` sets during nested loop execution can degrade performance significantly."
   - **Explanation**: High hit counts indicate that if many intersections are found (but contain different numbers), redundant insertions increase computational load.

4. **Invariant for Ambiguity Resolution**:
   - **Description**: "If the size of the intersection set `jdob` consistently exceeds one, indicating ambiguity, the code will spend excessive time resolving this ambiguity without reaching a valid output."
   - **Explanation**: This situation increases unnecessary iterations, especially when both participants have many ambiguous overlapping numbers.

These invariants capture the main scenarios that could lead to slow performance, focusing on the quadratic scaling with the number of pairs and the intensification of operations when the sets of pairs have many overlaps or are large.

### Phase 3: Implementing the Natural Language Invariants in C++

Below are C++ code snippets implementing runtime checks based on the previously derived performance-characterizing invariants:

```cpp
void check_large_pairs(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large number of pairs!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_common_elements(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - many common elements!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_ambiguity_resolution(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - resolving ambiguity!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrating the Checker Code into the Original Program

Here's how to integrate the checker functions into the original C++ program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#pragma GCC optimize("O3")
using namespace std;

void check_large_pairs(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large number of pairs!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_common_elements(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - many common elements!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_ambiguity_resolution(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - resolving ambiguity!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
    cin.tie(0);
    set<pair<int, int>> z[2];
    int roz[2];
    for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++) cin >> roz[i];
    
    // Check invariant for large pairs
    check_large_pairs(roz[0] > 10 && roz[1] > 10); // Check if both sets have a large number of pairs

    for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
        while (roz[i]--) {
            int a, b;
            cin >> a >> b;
            z[i].insert(make_pair(a, b));
            z[i].insert(make_pair(b, a));
        }
    }
    set<int> dobre;
    bool zle = false;
    for (int h = 0; h < 2; h++) {
        for (auto& it : z[h]) {
            vector<int> jed = {it.first, it.second};
            set<int> jdob;
            for (auto& it2 : z[h ^ 1]) {
                vector<int> dwa = {it2.first, it2.second};
                set<int> to_samo;
                for (int j : jed)
                    for (int d : dwa)
                        if (j == d) to_samo.insert(d);
                
                // Check for excessive common elements
                check_common_elements(to_samo.size() > 5); // Check if many common elements are found

                if ((int)to_samo.size() == 1) {
                    const int x = *to_samo.begin();
                    dobre.insert(x);
                    jdob.insert(x);
                }
            }
            // Check ambiguity resolution
            check_ambiguity_resolution(jdob.size() > 3); // Check if resolving ambiguity becomes extensive

            if ((int)jdob.size() > 1) {
                zle = true;
            }
        }
    }
    if ((int)dobre.size() == 1)
        cout << *dobre.begin() << endl;
    else if (zle)
        cout << -1 << endl;
    else
        cout << 0 << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of Integration

1. **`check_large_pairs`**: Integrated after reading the number of pairs. It checks if both `n` and `m` are large, indicating the potential for a large number of pair comparisons.

2. **`check_common_elements`**: Integrated within the nested loop. It checks if the number of common elements exceeds a threshold, indicating potential performance issues due to excessive intersection checks.

3. **`check_ambiguity_resolution`**: Integrated after checking intersections. It evaluates if the size of `jdob` indicates resolving ambiguity might be costly, which would suggest a bottleneck in performance.
