=== Invariants Response ===
To address the performance bottlenecks in the provided C program, let's go through the two phases:

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Line 5-9 (`isPrime` function):** The `isPrime` function is called 1,000,000 times during the slow input run. This function checks for primality by iterating up to the square root of the number (`x`), which means it performs many checks, particularly for large numbers.

2. **Line 19-23 (Prime count calculation):** The loop from `a` to `b` runs 1,000,001 times, and within this loop, the `isPrime` function is called. This results in a significant number of operations, especially when the range is large (like 1 to 1,000,000 in the slow input).

3. **High Iteration Count in `isPrime` (Line 7-8):** These lines inside the `isPrime` function have very high hit counts (67,818,902 and 67,740,404, respectively), indicating that a substantial amount of time is spent in this loop, checking for divisors.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the above insights, we can generate natural language performance invariants to describe conditions that lead to the slow path:

1. **Prime Checking Overhead:**
   - Natural language description: "When the range from `a` to `b` is large, and the number of prime checks is substantial, the program performs excessive calculations, leading to slow execution."
   - This invariant captures the idea that the primality test becomes a bottleneck due to its frequent execution over a large range.

2. **Large Ranges and Computational Complexity:**
   - Natural language description: "If the difference `b - a` approaches its maximum allowable value under input constraints, the program may experience significant slowdowns due to repeated iterations in prime calculations."
   - This reflects the scenario where the loop iterates over a large range, increasing computational demands.

3. **High Density of Prime Numbers:**
   - Natural language description: "When the required number of primes `k` is very high relative to the range size, and there is a dense concentration of primes, the program may perform extensive calculations to find valid segments, potentially slowing performance."
   - This invariant is based on the idea that high `k` values relative to the possible prime numbers in a range can lead to increased checking and computation.

These invariants are broad enough to capture potential slowdowns and suggest threshold conditions for triggering slow code paths, given the problem's constraints.

### Phase 3: Implementing the Natural Language Invariants in C++

Based on the performance-characterizing invariants derived earlier, here are the C++ snippets to check each condition:

1. **Prime Checking Overhead**
   - Natural language description: "When the range from `a` to `b` is large, and the number of prime checks is substantial, the program performs excessive calculations, leading to slow execution."

   ```cpp
   void check_prime_range_invariant(int a, int b) {
       if (b - a > 100000) { // Arbitrary threshold indicating a large range
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck triggered due to a large range of numbers being checked for primality!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Large Ranges and Computational Complexity**
   - Natural language description: "If the difference `b - a` approaches its maximum allowable value under input constraints, the program may experience significant slowdowns due to repeated iterations in prime calculations."

   ```cpp
   void check_large_range_invariant(int a, int b) {
       if (b - a == 1000000) { // Maximum allowable range in constraints
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck triggered due to maximum allowable range!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **High Density of Prime Numbers**
   - Natural language description: "When the required number of primes `k` is very high relative to the range size, and there is a dense concentration of primes, the program may perform extensive calculations to find valid segments, potentially slowing performance."

   ```cpp
   void check_high_prime_density_invariant(int k, int primeCount) {
       if (k > primeCount / 10) { // Arbitrary condition signifying a high density
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck triggered due to high requirement of prime numbers!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Integrating Checker Code into the Original Program

Now, we will integrate these checker functions into the existing C++ solution, ensuring they are placed appropriately to detect performance bottlenecks without adding significant overhead to the main loops.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int a, b, k;
int sum[1000050];

// Prime check function
bool isPrime(int x) {
    if (x < 2) return 0;
    for (int i = 2; i * i <= x; i++)
        if (x % i == 0) return 0;
    return 1;
}

// Checker functions
void check_prime_range_invariant(int a, int b) {
    if (b - a > 100000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck triggered due to a large range of numbers being checked for primality!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_large_range_invariant(int a, int b) {
    if (b - a == 1000000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck triggered due to maximum allowable range!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_high_prime_density_invariant(int k, int primeCount) {
    if (k > primeCount / 10) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck triggered due to high requirement of prime numbers!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

bool check(int x) {
    for (int i = a + x - 1; i <= b; i++)
        if (sum[i] - sum[i - x] < k) return 0;
    return 1;
}

int main() {
    scanf("%d%d%d", &a, &b, &k);

    // Insert invariant checks after input
    check_prime_range_invariant(a, b);
    check_large_range_invariant(a, b);

    sum[a - 1] = 0;
    for (int i = a; i <= b; i++) {
        if (isPrime(i))
            sum[i] = sum[i - 1] + 1;
        else
            sum[i] = sum[i - 1];
    }

    // Check for prime density after counting primes
    check_high_prime_density_invariant(k, sum[b] - sum[a - 1]);

    if (sum[b] - sum[a - 1] < k) {
        printf("-1\n");
        return 0;
    }

    int l = 0, r = b - a + 1, m;
    while (r - l > 1) {
        m = (l + r) >> 1;
        if (check(m))
            r = m;
        else
            l = m;
    }

    printf("%d\n", r);
    return 0;
}
```

**Explanations for Checker Placement:**

- **`check_prime_range_invariant` and `check_large_range_invariant`** are placed right after reading input values to immediately catch problematic ranges.
- **`check_high_prime_density_invariant`** is placed after calculating the prime counts to ensure it checks conditions based on derived data (total number of primes in the range).
