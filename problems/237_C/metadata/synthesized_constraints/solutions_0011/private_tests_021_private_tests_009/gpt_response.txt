### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Prime Sieve Loop (Lines 8-11):**  
   - The loop starting at line 8 continues until `i * i > 2 * b`. For slow input, this loop iterates many times (`707` times on the slow input vs `1` time on the fast input).
   - Line 11 involves marking non-prime numbers, which is costly when `b` is large. The sieve of Eratosthenes is implemented poorly as it operates up to `2*b`, which is unnecessary for this problem.

2. **Prime Counting Loop (Lines 16-29):**  
   - The nested loop structure starting at line 16 iterates over a large range (`2 * b`), making it hit counts of `2,000,002` on the slow input.
   - Within this loop, there is a costly checking mechanism for primes leading to `cnt` updates and adjustments, which are inefficient.

3. **Result Computing Loop (Lines 33-37 and 40-42):**  
   - The loops at lines 33 and 40 iterate over the range `[a, b]`, hitting lines `1,000,001` times for the slow input. 
   - These loops perform checks and updates that cumulatively add to the execution time.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **Prime Sieve Inefficiency:**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "If the algorithm attempts to sieve primes up to a number much larger than necessary, especially twice the maximum range `b` of interest, performance degrades significantly."
   - **Implementation Suggestion:** The sieve should be limited to just `b`, not `2*b`, as the problem only requires primes up to `b`.

2. **Repeated Large Range Checks:**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "If the range `[a, b]` is large, exceeding a critical threshold, and the code performs repeated prime checks over this large range, this can lead to a significant slowdown."
   - **Implementation Suggestion:** Optimizing the range over which checks are performed could reduce unnecessary operations.

3. **High Prime Count Requirement:**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "If the required number of primes `k` is very high relative to the size of the range `[a, b]`, the program might enter a slow path due to extensive iteration and checks."
   - **Implementation Suggestion:** Early exits or shortcuts might be used when `k` is proportionally large compared to `b - a + 1` to handle cases where the solution is clearly not possible.

4. **Inefficient Prime Counting:**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "When the algorithm processes potential prime numbers inefficiently due to excessive conditional checks and updates, especially within large loops, it can cause performance degradation."
   - **Implementation Suggestion:** Streamlining or restructuring these checks could significantly improve execution times.

By understanding these patterns and applying appropriate thresholds or constraints, programmers can detect and preemptively handle potential slowdowns without over-relying on specific input values.

### Phase 3: Implementing the Natural Language Invariants as C++ Checkers

Below are the implementations of the performance-characterizing invariants using C++ code.

1. **Prime Sieve Inefficiency:**
   ```cpp
   void check_prime_sieve_invariant(int b) {
       if (b > 500000) { // Arbitrary threshold, assuming performance degrades for high b
           cerr << "Warning: prime_sieve_invariant triggered - unnecessary sieving range!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Repeated Large Range Checks:**
   ```cpp
   void check_large_range_invariant(int a, int b) {
       if (b - a > 800000) { // Arbitrary threshold, assumes slowdown for large range
           cerr << "Warning: large_range_invariant triggered - large range processing!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **High Prime Count Requirement:**
   ```cpp
   void check_high_prime_count_invariant(int a, int b, int k) {
       if (k > (b - a) / 2) { // Assumes slowdown when k is disproportionately large
           cerr << "Warning: high_prime_count_invariant triggered - high k relative to range!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

4. **Inefficient Prime Counting:**
   ```cpp
   void check_prime_counting_invariant(int a, int b) {
       if (b - a > 800000) { // Similar threshold to capture inefficient counting range
           cerr << "Warning: prime_counting_invariant triggered - inefficient range processing!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Integrating the Checkers into the Original Program

Here is the instrumented version of the C++ code with the checks integrated at effective points:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>

int A[2000009], B[2000009], C[2000009];
int a, b, k, i, j, max, last, res, cnt;

// Checker functions to monitor potential bottlenecks
void check_prime_sieve_invariant(int b) {
    if (b > 500000) {
        cerr << "Warning: prime_sieve_invariant triggered - unnecessary sieving range!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_large_range_invariant(int a, int b) {
    if (b - a > 800000) {
        cerr << "Warning: large_range_invariant triggered - large range processing!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_high_prime_count_invariant(int a, int b, int k) {
    if (k > (b - a) / 2) {
        cerr << "Warning: high_prime_count_invariant triggered - high k relative to range!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_prime_counting_invariant(int a, int b) {
    if (b - a > 800000) {
        cerr << "Warning: prime_counting_invariant triggered - inefficient range processing!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    while (scanf("%d %d %d", &a, &b, &k) == 3) {
        // Apply checkers after input has been read
        check_prime_sieve_invariant(b);
        check_large_range_invariant(a, b);
        check_high_prime_count_invariant(a, b, k);
        check_prime_counting_invariant(a, b);

        A[0] = 1;
        A[1] = 1;
        for (i = 3;; i = i + 2) {
            if (i * i > 2 * b) break;
            if (A[i] == 0)
                for (j = i * i; j <= 2 * b; j = j + i + i) A[j] = 1;
        }
        for (i = 2 * b; i >= 0; i--) B[i] = 0;
        cnt = 0;
        last = 2 * b;
        for (i = 2 * b; i >= 0; i--) {
            if ((i % 2 != 0 && A[i] == 0) || i == 2) {
                if (cnt == 0) last = i;
                cnt++;
            }
            if (cnt > k) {
                cnt--;
                for (j = last - 1;; j--)
                    if ((j % 2 != 0 && A[j] == 0) || j == 2) {
                        last = j;
                        break;
                    }
            }
            if (cnt >= k) B[i] = last;
        }
        for (i = a; i <= b; i++) C[i] = 0;
        max = -1;
        for (i = a; i <= b; i++) {
            if (B[i] != 0) {
                if (max == -1 || B[i] - i > max) max = B[i] - i;
            }
            C[i] = max;
        }
        res = -1;
        for (i = 1; i <= b - a + 1; i++) {
            if (b - i + 1 >= a) {
                if (C[b - i + 1] != -1 && C[b - i + 1] < i) {
                    res = i;
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
        printf("%d\n", res);
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

- **Checker Functions:** Are defined at the beginning of the program before `main()` to ensure they are easily accessible and maintainable.
- **Check Integration:** The checkers are called right after input is parsed to ensure that they evaluate the conditions based on the input constraints. This placement avoids adding overhead within critical loops.
