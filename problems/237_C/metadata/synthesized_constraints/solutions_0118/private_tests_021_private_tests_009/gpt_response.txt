### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Seive Function:**
   - The `seive` function, particularly the nested loops at lines 25-27, has significantly higher hit counts during the slow input run. Notably, line 26 and line 27 are executed 5,986,516 and 5,985,517 times, respectively.
   - This indicates the prime number sieve is computationally expensive, especially when dealing with the range from 1 to 1,000,000.

2. **Prime Count Calculation:**
   - The loop from line 31 to 32 is executed 1,000,001 times during the slow input run. This loop updates the cumulative prime counts for the range, and it is not hit significantly during the fast input due to the smaller input size.

3. **Overall Complexity:**
   - The complexity of the sieve algorithm is roughly O(n log log n), but given the input constraints (a ≤ b ≤ 10^6), it becomes a bottleneck for large ranges.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **Prime Number Sieve Complexity:**
   - Natural Language Invariant: "When the range between a and b is large, the sieve of Eratosthenes becomes computationally intensive, slowing down the program due to the increased number of operations required to calculate prime numbers."

2. **Prime Count Computation:**
   - Natural Language Invariant: "If the difference between b and a approaches the upper limit of the input constraint, the cumulative calculation of prime counts across this range is repeated many times, contributing to the slowdown."

3. **Overall Input Size Impact:**
   - Natural Language Invariant: "The program's performance degrades significantly when the input range is vast, close to the maximum constraint, leading to extensive memory usage and increased computational effort for both prime sieving and prime count calculations."

### Summary

The primary performance bottleneck in the program is the computational intensity of the sieve function and the subsequent prime counting mechanism when the range between `a` and `b` is large. This results in massive hit counts in the nested loops of the sieve function. The inefficiency is amplified when `b - a` approaches 10^6, leading to slow execution due to the lengthy operations required to process such a range.

### Phase 3: Implementing Checker Code in C++

Based on the performance-characterizing invariants we identified, here's the C++ checker code for each invariant:

1. **Prime Number Sieve Complexity Checker:**
   ```cpp
   void check_sieve_invariant(int a, int b, int threshold) {
       if (b - a > threshold) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large range for sieve!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Prime Count Calculation Checker:**
   ```cpp
   void check_prime_count_invariant(int a, int b, int threshold) {
       if (b - a > threshold) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive prime count calculation!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Overall Input Size Impact Checker:**
   ```cpp
   void check_input_size_invariant(int a, int b, int maxLimit) {
       if (b - a + 1 > maxLimit) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - input size too large!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Integrating Checker Code into the Original Program

Here is the original C++ solution with the newly added checker functions:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

vector<bool> primes;
vector<int> primesCnt;

void check_sieve_invariant(int a, int b, int threshold) {
    if (b - a > threshold) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large range for sieve!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_prime_count_invariant(int a, int b, int threshold) {
    if (b - a > threshold) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive prime count calculation!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_input_size_invariant(int a, int b, int maxLimit) {
    if (b - a + 1 > maxLimit) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - input size too large!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void seive(int a, int b) {
    primes = vector<bool>(b + 1, true);
    primesCnt = vector<int>(b, true);
    primes[0] = primes[1] = false;
    for (int i = 2; i * i <= b; i++) {
        for (int j = i; j * i <= b; j++) {
            primes[i * j] = false;
        }
    }
    primesCnt[0] = 0;
    for (decltype(b + 1)(i) = (1); (i) < (b + 1); (i)++) {
        primesCnt[i] = primesCnt[i - 1] + primes[i];
    }
}

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(nullptr);

    int a, b, k, ans = -1;
    cin >> a >> b >> k;

    // Checker invocations
    check_sieve_invariant(a, b, 500000); // Checking sieve complexity
    check_prime_count_invariant(a, b, 500000); // Checking prime count calculation complexity
    check_input_size_invariant(a, b, 1000000); // Checking overall input size

    seive(a, b);
    if (primesCnt[b] - primesCnt[a - 1] < k) {
        cout << ans;
        return 0;
    }

    int left = 0, right = b - a + 1, med;
    while (right > left + 1) {
        med = (right + left) / 2;
        bool can = true;
        int j = a + med - 1;
        while (j <= b) {
            if (primesCnt[j] - primesCnt[j - med] < k) {
                can = false;
                break;
            }
            j++;
        }
        if (can)
            right = med;
        else
            left = med;
    }
    cout << right;
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of Inserted Checks

- **check_sieve_invariant**: Before executing the sieve logic, this check ensures that the range is not too large, which would slow down the sieve operation.
- **check_prime_count_invariant**: This check is placed to ensure the subsequent prime counting calculations are not performed on excessively large ranges.
- **check_input_size_invariant**: This is a general safeguard to ensure the inputs do not exceed size constraints that would lead to performance issues. 

These checks help identify the conditions under which the program might slow down significantly, thereby aiding in performance tuning and debugging.
