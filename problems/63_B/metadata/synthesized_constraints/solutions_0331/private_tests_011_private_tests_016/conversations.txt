system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

In a strategic computer game "Settlers II" one has to build defense structures to expand and protect the territory. Let's take one of these buildings. At the moment the defense structure accommodates exactly n soldiers. Within this task we can assume that the number of soldiers in the defense structure won't either increase or decrease.

Every soldier has a rank — some natural number from 1 to k. 1 stands for a private and k stands for a general. The higher the rank of the soldier is, the better he fights. Therefore, the player profits from having the soldiers of the highest possible rank.

To increase the ranks of soldiers they need to train. But the soldiers won't train for free, and each training session requires one golden coin. On each training session all the n soldiers are present.

At the end of each training session the soldiers' ranks increase as follows. First all the soldiers are divided into groups with the same rank, so that the least possible number of groups is formed. Then, within each of the groups where the soldiers below the rank k are present, exactly one soldier increases his rank by one.

You know the ranks of all n soldiers at the moment. Determine the number of golden coins that are needed to increase the ranks of all the soldiers to the rank k.

Input

The first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 100). They represent the number of soldiers and the number of different ranks correspondingly. The second line contains n numbers in the non-decreasing order. The i-th of them, ai, represents the rank of the i-th soldier in the defense building (1 ≤ i ≤ n, 1 ≤ ai ≤ k).

Output

Print a single integer — the number of golden coins needed to raise all the soldiers to the maximal rank.

Examples

Input

4 4
1 2 2 3


Output

4

Input

4 3
1 1 1 1


Output

5

Note

In the first example the ranks will be raised in the following manner:

1 2 2 3 →  2 2 3 4 →  2 3 4 4 →  3 4 4 4 →  4 4 4 4

Thus totals to 4 training sessions that require 4 golden coins.

(F) Program Solving the Problem Statement

int main() {
  int n, m;
  cin >> n >> m;
  int t[n];
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {

    cout << m - t[0];
    return 0;
  }

        st.insert(t[i]);
        t[i]++;
      }

assistant: ### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Comparison of Hit Counts**:
   - Lines within the outer loop (`for (int k = 0; k < n * n * n; k++)`) are executed significantly more times in the slow input. Particularly, lines 17, 18, and 23 are hit around 100 million times.
   - This loop runs `n^3` times due to the condition `k < n * n * n`, resulting in excessive iteration and redundancy.

2. **Pinpointing Inefficiencies**:
   - The outer loop iterating `n^3` times is a performance bottleneck, specifically for larger values of `n` like 100.
   - The inner loop iterates over `n` elements and increments soldiers' ranks. This inner loop, combined with the high hit counts, suggests inefficiency related to excessive repetition.

3. **Data Structure Interaction**:
   - The set `st` is used to track unique ranks that were increased. The inefficiency is exacerbated by the set operations within the nested loops.
   - Data updates and rank comparisons are repeatedly performed for large inputs, leading to unnecessary operations and slowing down the execution.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **Natural Language Invariants**:
   - **Invariant 1**: "The code exhibits significant slowdowns when the number of soldiers `n` is large and their initial ranks are uniformly low, causing excessive iterations in nested loops."
   - **Invariant 2**: "If the number of soldiers `n` approaches the upper constraint and their ranks start off as the minimal possible rank, redundant set operations and data updates amplify the program’s execution time."
   - **Invariant 3**: "Performance is adversely impacted when all soldiers require maximum rank upgrades, leading to a cubic number of iterations due to nested looping based on `n`."

2. **Thresholds and Conditions**:
   - **Thresholds**: The inefficiency is primarily triggered when `n` is large, close to its constraint of 100. This, combined with all soldiers starting at the lowest rank, `1`, causes the nested loops to iterate maximally.
   - **Conditions**: Focus on scenarios where a high uniformity in initial ranks combined with high `n` triggers constant rank increments, resulting in a high number of cycle iterations.

3. **Abstract and Broad Statements**:
   - The slow path can be abstracted as being driven by high input uniformity in soldier ranks, coupled with maximum soldier count, causing the algorithm to run unnecessary iterations.
   - Future scenarios with similar initial conditions (e.g., all ranks starting at 1 when `n` is near 100) would likely replicate the slow execution pattern.

### Summary

The code slows significantly under conditions of high uniformity in initial ranks and maximum soldier count due to inefficient nested loop iteration over `n^3`. The execution becomes unnecessarily repetitive due to constant rank increments, resulting in excessive set operations and data updates. The slow performance is triggered by these conditions, which push the algorithm into a cubic time complexity regime, overwhelming the program’s efficiency.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
In a strategic computer game "Settlers II" one has to build defense structures to expand and protect the territory. Let's take one of these buildings. At the moment the defense structure accommodates exactly n soldiers. Within this task we can assume that the number of soldiers in the defense structure won't either increase or decrease.

Every soldier has a rank — some natural number from 1 to k. 1 stands for a private and k stands for a general. The higher the rank of the soldier is, the better he fights. Therefore, the player profits from having the soldiers of the highest possible rank.

To increase the ranks of soldiers they need to train. But the soldiers won't train for free, and each training session requires one golden coin. On each training session all the n soldiers are present.

At the end of each training session the soldiers' ranks increase as follows. First all the soldiers are divided into groups with the same rank, so that the least possible number of groups is formed. Then, within each of the groups where the soldiers below the rank k are present, exactly one soldier increases his rank by one.

You know the ranks of all n soldiers at the moment. Determine the number of golden coins that are needed to increase the ranks of all the soldiers to the rank k.

Input

The first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 100). They represent the number of soldiers and the number of different ranks correspondingly. The second line contains n numbers in the non-decreasing order. The i-th of them, ai, represents the rank of the i-th soldier in the defense building (1 ≤ i ≤ n, 1 ≤ ai ≤ k).

Output

Print a single integer — the number of golden coins needed to raise all the soldiers to the maximal rank.

Examples

Input

4 4
1 2 2 3


Output

4

Input

4 3
1 1 1 1


Output

Note

In the first example the ranks will be raised in the following manner:

1 2 2 3 →  2 2 3 4 →  2 3 4 4 →  3 4 4 4 →  4 4 4 4

Thus totals to 4 training sessions that require 4 golden coins.

Solution (C++ code):
{solution}


assistant: ### Phase 3: Implement the Natural Language Invariants in C++

Let's transform the identified performance-characterizing invariants into runtime checks in C++.

1. **Invariant 1**: "The code exhibits significant slowdowns when the number of soldiers `n` is large and their initial ranks are uniformly low, causing excessive iterations in nested loops."

```cpp
void check_uniform_low_ranks_invariant(int n, const vector<int>& ranks, int k) {
    if (n == 100 && ranks.front() == 1 && ranks.back() < k) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - uniform low ranks with large n." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

2. **Invariant 2**: "If the number of soldiers `n` approaches the upper constraint and their ranks start off as the minimal possible rank, redundant set operations and data updates amplify the program’s execution time."

```cpp
void check_minimal_ranks_with_large_n_invariant(int n, const vector<int>& ranks) {
    int uniqueRanks = std::set<int>(ranks.begin(), ranks.end()).size();
    if (n == 100 && uniqueRanks == 1 && ranks.front() == 1) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - minimal ranks with maximum soldiers." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

3. **Invariant 3**: "Performance is adversely impacted when all soldiers require maximum rank upgrades, leading to a cubic number of iterations due to nested looping based on `n`."

```cpp
void check_maximum_upgrades_needed_invariant(int n, const vector<int>& ranks, int k) {
    if (n == 100 && std::all_of(ranks.begin(), ranks.end(), [&](int rank) { return rank == 1; })) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - all soldiers require maximum upgrades." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrate the Checks into the Original Program

Now, let's integrate these runtime checks into the original C++ program.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Phase 3: Add the helper functions for invariants
void check_uniform_low_ranks_invariant(int n, const vector<int>& ranks, int k) {
    if (n == 100 && ranks.front() == 1 && ranks.back() < k) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - uniform low ranks with large n." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_minimal_ranks_with_large_n_invariant(int n, const vector<int>& ranks) {
    int uniqueRanks = std::set<int>(ranks.begin(), ranks.end()).size();
    if (n == 100 && uniqueRanks == 1 && ranks.front() == 1) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - minimal ranks with maximum soldiers." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_maximum_upgrades_needed_invariant(int n, const vector<int>& ranks, int k) {
    if (n == 100 && std::all_of(ranks.begin(), ranks.end(), [&](int rank) { return rank == 1; })) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - all soldiers require maximum upgrades." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    int n, m;
    cin >> n >> m;
    vector<int> t(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        cin >> t[i];
    }

    // Phase 4: Insert checks after reading input
    check_uniform_low_ranks_invariant(n, t, m);
    check_minimal_ranks_with_large_n_invariant(n, t);
    check_maximum_upgrades_needed_invariant(n, t, m);

    if (n == 1) {
        cout << m - t[0];

### Summary

- We converted the performance-characterizing invariants into checks with helper functions.
- These checks are integrated just after the input is read to catch potential performance issues before the main computation begins.
- Each check is designed to trigger if the conditions leading to slow execution paths are met, providing a warning and aborting execution.
