system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

In a strategic computer game "Settlers II" one has to build defense structures to expand and protect the territory. Let's take one of these buildings. At the moment the defense structure accommodates exactly n soldiers. Within this task we can assume that the number of soldiers in the defense structure won't either increase or decrease.

Every soldier has a rank — some natural number from 1 to k. 1 stands for a private and k stands for a general. The higher the rank of the soldier is, the better he fights. Therefore, the player profits from having the soldiers of the highest possible rank.

To increase the ranks of soldiers they need to train. But the soldiers won't train for free, and each training session requires one golden coin. On each training session all the n soldiers are present.

At the end of each training session the soldiers' ranks increase as follows. First all the soldiers are divided into groups with the same rank, so that the least possible number of groups is formed. Then, within each of the groups where the soldiers below the rank k are present, exactly one soldier increases his rank by one.

You know the ranks of all n soldiers at the moment. Determine the number of golden coins that are needed to increase the ranks of all the soldiers to the rank k.

Input

The first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 100). They represent the number of soldiers and the number of different ranks correspondingly. The second line contains n numbers in the non-decreasing order. The i-th of them, ai, represents the rank of the i-th soldier in the defense building (1 ≤ i ≤ n, 1 ≤ ai ≤ k).

Output

Print a single integer — the number of golden coins needed to raise all the soldiers to the maximal rank.

Examples

Input

4 4
1 2 2 3


Output

4

Input

4 3
1 1 1 1


Output

5

Note

In the first example the ranks will be raised in the following manner:

1 2 2 3 →  2 2 3 4 →  2 3 4 4 →  3 4 4 4 →  4 4 4 4

Thus totals to 4 training sessions that require 4 golden coins.

} /* line 26 slow_hit_count: 1, fast_hit_count: 1 */


assistant: To diagnose the performance issue in the given C program, we analyze the line-level hit counts and the logic of the code. Here's a breakdown of the code and a derivation of performance-characterizing invariants:

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Line-level hit count analysis:**

   - **Line 15**: `while (p < k)` - This loop is executed 99 times for the slow input whereas only once for the fast input.
   - **Line 18 to Line 21**: The inner `for` loop (lines 18-21) runs 4949 times for the slow input, which indicates a significant inefficiency compared to the fast input where it is not executed at all.

2. **Code Logic Interaction with Inputs:**

   - The program trains soldiers and increases their ranks until all reach the rank `k`.
   - The outer `while` loop continues until the lowest rank `p` (initialized to `mn`, the minimum rank at the start) reaches `k`.
   - The inner `for` loop iterates from `k-1` down to `p`, and it is responsible for increasing the rank of the soldiers.

3. **Insight:**
   - The inefficiency arises when there is a significant gap between the initial rank of the soldier(s) and the maximum rank `k`. This causes the outer `while` loop to execute many times, and for each iteration, the inner `for` loop also executes multiple times.
   - The hit count from the slow input highlights that the loop operation becomes expensive when the rank of soldiers is initially low compared to `k`.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the analysis, we can derive the following performance-characterizing invariants:

1. **Rank Gap Impact:**

   - **Invariant Statement:** "If the initial rank of the soldiers is significantly lower than the maximum rank `k`, the outer loop will execute many iterations, leading to a performance slowdown."

2. **Loop Execution:**

   - **Invariant Statement:** "When there is a substantial difference between the current minimum rank and the maximum rank `k`, the inner loop will execute a large number of times for each iteration of the outer loop, causing inefficient operations."

3. **Group Formation and Rank Increase:**

   - **Invariant Statement:** "If soldiers are initially clustered at ranks far below `k`, the program will form large groups that require many iterations to evenly distribute the rank increases, resulting in many repeated operations."

By focusing on the gap between the soldiers' initial ranks and the maximum possible rank `k`, we identify that the slowdown is primarily due to the repeated iterations needed to incrementally increase the ranks in small steps. This analysis captures the core inefficiency under the constraints of `n <= 100` and `k <= 100`.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
In a strategic computer game "Settlers II" one has to build defense structures to expand and protect the territory. Let's take one of these buildings. At the moment the defense structure accommodates exactly n soldiers. Within this task we can assume that the number of soldiers in the defense structure won't either increase or decrease.

Every soldier has a rank — some natural number from 1 to k. 1 stands for a private and k stands for a general. The higher the rank of the soldier is, the better he fights. Therefore, the player profits from having the soldiers of the highest possible rank.

To increase the ranks of soldiers they need to train. But the soldiers won't train for free, and each training session requires one golden coin. On each training session all the n soldiers are present.

At the end of each training session the soldiers' ranks increase as follows. First all the soldiers are divided into groups with the same rank, so that the least possible number of groups is formed. Then, within each of the groups where the soldiers below the rank k are present, exactly one soldier increases his rank by one.

You know the ranks of all n soldiers at the moment. Determine the number of golden coins that are needed to increase the ranks of all the soldiers to the rank k.

Input

The first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 100). They represent the number of soldiers and the number of different ranks correspondingly. The second line contains n numbers in the non-decreasing order. The i-th of them, ai, represents the rank of the i-th soldier in the defense building (1 ≤ i ≤ n, 1 ≤ ai ≤ k).

Output

Print a single integer — the number of golden coins needed to raise all the soldiers to the maximal rank.

Examples

Input

4 4
1 2 2 3


Output

4

Input

4 3
1 1 1 1


Output

Note

In the first example the ranks will be raised in the following manner:

1 2 2 3 →  2 2 3 4 →  2 3 4 4 →  3 4 4 4 →  4 4 4 4

Thus totals to 4 training sessions that require 4 golden coins.

Solution (C++ code):
{solution}


assistant: ### Phase 3: Implementing the Natural Language Invariants in C++

Let's transform the previously derived performance-characterizing invariants into runtime checks:

1. **Rank Gap Impact Check:**

   This checks if the initial ranks are significantly lower than the maximum rank `k`.

   ```cpp
   void check_rank_gap_invariant(int minRank, int maxRank) {
       if (maxRank - minRank > 50) { // Threshold is set based on a significant rank gap
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to significant rank gap!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Loop Execution Check:**

   This checks for substantial differences between the current minimum rank and `k` to avoid excessive loop iterations.

   ```cpp
   void check_loop_execution_invariant(int currentMinRank, int maxRank) {
       if (maxRank - currentMinRank > 50) { // Threshold indicative of excessive loop iteration potential
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to excessive loop execution!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Group Formation Check:**

   This checks if the soldiers are initially clustered at ranks far below `k`.

   ```cpp
   void check_group_formation_invariant(int minRank, int maxRank) {
       if (maxRank - minRank > 50) { // Similar threshold for when large groups are formed
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to inefficient group formation!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Integrating Checkers into the Original Program

Here is the instrumented C++ code with the performance checks integrated effectively:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
map<int, int> m;

// Checkers for performance bottlenecks
void check_rank_gap_invariant(int minRank, int maxRank) {
    if (maxRank - minRank > 50) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to significant rank gap!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_loop_execution_invariant(int currentMinRank, int maxRank) {
    if (maxRank - currentMinRank > 50) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to excessive loop execution!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_group_formation_invariant(int minRank, int maxRank) {
    if (maxRank - minRank > 50) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to inefficient group formation!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    int a, t, n, i, j, k, l, mn = INT_MAX, mx = 0;
    cin >> n >> k;
    int cnt = 0;
    int ans = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        cin >> a;
        mn = min(mn, a);
        m[a]++;
    }
    
    // Insert checker after input and initial setup
    check_rank_gap_invariant(mn, k);

    int p = mn;
    while (p < k) {
        ans++;
        mn = INT_MAX;

        // Insert checker at the beginning of the loop
        check_loop_execution_invariant(p, k);

        for (int i = k - 1; i >= p; i--) {
            if (m[i] > 0) m[i]--, m[i + 1]++;
            if (m[i] > 0) mn = min(mn, i);
            if (m[i + 1] > 0) mn = min(mn, i + 1);
        }

        // Insert checker at the end of the loop
        check_group_formation_invariant(p, k);

        p = mn;
    }
    cout << ans << "\n";
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Check Placement:** The checkers are placed strategically to cover potential performance bottlenecks without adding overhead to tight loops. The invariant checks are placed after the input is read and during key phases of the loop execution.
- **Thresholds:** The threshold of `50` is used as an intuitive measure (given `n, k <= 100`) to detect when the execution might significantly slow down, based on the performance analysis of the slow input. The exact threshold can be adjusted based on empirical testing or deeper analysis if needed.
- **Code Integrity:** The program will terminate with a warning if any of the conditions that might lead to a performance slowdown are triggered, which is useful for debugging and testing purposes.
