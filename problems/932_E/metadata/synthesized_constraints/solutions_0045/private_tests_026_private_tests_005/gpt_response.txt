=== Invariants Response ===
To analyze the given C program and derive performance-characterizing invariants, let's break it down into the two phases as requested.

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

**1.** **Comparison of Line-Level Hit Counts:**
- Lines inside the function `PowerMod` are hit more frequently during both runs, indicating that it is a heavily used function.
- For the slow input, lines 31 to 37 have significantly high hit counts, while they are not executed for the fast input. This suggests that this part of the code is a major factor for the slowdown.

**2.** **Pinpoint Slower Lines/Functions:**
- The `else` block starting at line 29 is executed for the slow input because `n > k`. Within this block, lines 31 to 37 are executed repeatedly, with line 33 being particularly costly due to nested loops over `k`.

**3.** **Interaction with Data Structures:**
- The `dp` table is used extensively in this section, and the nested loop iterating over `k` (line 33) suggests a significant computational load which scales with `k`.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

**1.** **Invariant Descriptions:**

1. **Large `k` Leading to Repeated Operations:**
   - "When `k` is large relative to input constraints, the nested loops over `k` in the dynamic programming table computation may cause significant slowdowns. This is exacerbated when `n > k`, triggering the use of precomputed powers and additional operations."
   
2. **Inefficient Power Computation for Large `n`:**
   - "If `n` is significantly larger than `k` and the computation involves repeatedly raising numbers to the power of `n-k`, the power calculation function (`PowerMod`) is invoked frequently, leading to increased computation time."

3. **Memory and Computational Overhead with DP Arrays:**
   - "The use of large 2D arrays (`dp`) for dynamic programming in cases where `n` is substantially larger than `k` can result in excessive memory use and computational overhead due to numerous calculations performed per element."

4. **High Hit Rate on Recursive Structure:**
   - "When exploring deep or extensive recursive-like computations (in this case, nested operations over `k`), performance can degrade significantly if `k` is high, doubling work for each decrement in `k`."

These natural language statements capture the core reasons for slowdown, focusing especially on the conditions under which the dynamic programming solution becomes inefficient, such as when `n` is much larger than `k` and large values of `k` trigger extensive computation. The statements abstract the hit count specifics into broad performance characteristics, aligning with the input constraints of the problem (e.g., `1 ≤ N ≤ 10^9` and `1 ≤ k ≤ 5000`).

=== Checker Response ===
Let's proceed to implement the performance-characterizing invariants in C++ and integrate them into the given program.

### Phase 3: Implement the Natural Language Invariants as Checker Code in C++

1. **Large `k` Leading to Repeated Operations:**
   ```cpp
   void check_large_k_invariant(bool condition) {
       if (condition) {
           cerr << "Warning: large_k_invariant triggered - excessive operations for large k" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Inefficient Power Computation for Large `n`:**
   ```cpp
   void check_power_computation_invariant(bool condition) {
       if (condition) {
           cerr << "Warning: power_computation_invariant triggered - inefficient power computations for large n" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Memory and Computational Overhead with DP Arrays:**
   ```cpp
   void check_dp_array_invariant(bool condition) {
       if (condition) {
           cerr << "Warning: dp_array_invariant triggered - large memory or computational overhead with dp array" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Integrate Checker Code into the Original Program

Now, let's integrate these checks into the original C++ program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
const int N = 5e3 + 100;
const int mod = 1e9 + 7;
long long dp[N][N];
long long g[N];

// Checker functions based on identified performance bottlenecks
void check_large_k_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: large_k_invariant triggered - excessive operations for large k" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_power_computation_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: power_computation_invariant triggered - inefficient power computations for large n" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_dp_array_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dp_array_invariant triggered - large memory or computational overhead with dp array" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Function to compute power modulo
long long PowerMod(long long a, long long b) {
    long long ans = 1;
    a = a % mod;
    while (b) {
        if (b & 1) ans = (ans * a) % mod;
        a = (a * a) % mod;
        b >>= 1;
    }
    return ans;
}

void solve() {
    long long n;
    int k;
    scanf("%lld%d", &n, &k);

    // Invariant checks
    check_large_k_invariant(k > 4000);  // Arbitrary threshold for demonstration
    check_power_computation_invariant(n > 500000);  // Arbitrary threshold for demonstration
    check_dp_array_invariant(k > 4000);  // Arbitrary threshold for the size of dp

    long long ans = 0;
    long long temp = n;

    if (n <= k) {
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            ans += (temp * PowerMod(i, k));
            ans %= mod;
            temp = temp * (n - i) % mod * PowerMod(i + 1, mod - 2) % mod;
        }
    } else {
        dp[0][k] = PowerMod(2, n - k);
        for (int i = k - 1; i >= 0; i--) dp[0][i] = dp[0][i + 1] * 2 % mod;
        for (int i = 1; i <= k; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j <= k; j++) {
                dp[i][j] = ((n - j) * (dp[i - 1][j + 1] + g[j + 1]) % mod + j * dp[i - 1][j]) % mod;
                g[j + 1] = g[j + 1] * (j + 1) % mod;
            }
        }
        ans = dp[k][0];
    }
    printf("%lld\n", ans);
}

int main() {
    solve();
    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**

- **Check Placement:** The checks are placed immediately after reading inputs and before any heavy computations. This ensures that we don't introduce additional overhead in critical code paths.
- **Conditions:** The conditions in the checker functions are based on thresholds suggested in the performance-characterizing invariants. These thresholds are arbitrary values that can be adjusted based on further profiling data.
- **Abort on Detection:** Each check produces a warning and aborts execution if a potential bottleneck condition is detected, making it clear when a performance issue arises.
