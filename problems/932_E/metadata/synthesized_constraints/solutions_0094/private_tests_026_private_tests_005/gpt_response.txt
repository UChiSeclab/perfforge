=== Invariants Response ===
To analyze the performance bottlenecks in the provided C program, we need to undertake two phases: identifying inefficient code segments and deriving performance-characterizing invariants that describe slow paths. Letâ€™s follow these phases systematically:

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Comparing Line-Level Hit Counts:**
   - The function `qsm`, which computes a power modulo (lines 6-13), is significantly more frequently executed in the slow input (132,735 times) compared to the fast input (7,353 times). This indicates many more recursive or iterative calls in the slow case.
   - The loop in lines 35 and 36 within the computation of `s2` array (Stirling numbers of the second kind calculation) is executed 10,472,175 times for the slow input, compared to 0 for the fast input. This suggests that this loop is a major contributor to the slowdown.
   - The loop on line 38, which involves multiple nested operations (`fac2[i]`, `C(i)`, `s2[k][i]`, and `qsm(2, n - i)`), is executed over 4,576 times for the slow input, indicating its potential to be computationally expensive.

2. **Infer Function Interactions:**
   - `qsm` is used for modular exponentiation, which may become costly with larger values of its parameters.
   - The `s2` matrix computation uses nested loops, suggesting that it has a direct impact on the performance, especially when `k` is large.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the identified bottlenecks and data structure interactions, we can outline the following performance-characterizing invariants in natural language:

1. **Invariant Related to Stirling Numbers Computation:**
   - "If the value of `k` is close to its upper limit (5000), the program may slow down significantly due to the heavy computation of Stirling numbers of the second kind, which requires nested loops over `k x k` iterations."

2. **Invariant Related to Modular Exponentiation:**
   - "When computing powers with `qsm`, if `n` is much larger than `k`, the function is invoked excessively during calculations involving powers of 2, leading to a slowdown. This is exacerbated when `n` is close to its upper limit (1 billion)."

3. **Invariant Related to Factorial Computations:**
   - "If both `n` and `k` are large, the combination (`C(i)`) and factorial computations become performance-critical due to the repeated multiplication and division modulo large numbers."

### Summary

The primary slowdown triggers involve large computations of Stirling numbers, excessive calls to modular exponentiation, and factorial operations when `k` approaches 5000 and `n` is large. These conditions lead to excessive iterations and multiplicative operations that degrade performance. By monitoring these conditions, one can detect potential future slow scenarios and improve the algorithm's efficiency.

=== Checker Response ===
### Phase 3: Implement the Natural Language Invariants as C++ Checker Code

Based on the performance-characterizing invariants derived earlier, here are the C++ checkers for each invariant:

1. **Checker for Stirling Numbers Computation:**
   ```cpp
   void check_stirling_invariant(int k) {
       if (k >= 4500) { // Assuming a high threshold value for `k` close to its limit
           cerr << "Warning: Potential slowdown due to large k in Stirling numbers computation!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Checker for Modular Exponentiation:**
   ```cpp
   void check_modular_exponentiation_invariant(int n, int k) {
       if (n > (1 << 20)) { // Arbitrary threshold for n to indicate potential slowdowns
           cerr << "Warning: Potential slowdown due to excessive calls to modular exponentiation!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Checker for Factorial Computations:**
   ```cpp
   void check_factorial_invariant(int n, int k) {
       if (n > 1e8 && k > 4500) { // High values for n and k leading to factorial operations
           cerr << "Warning: Potential slowdown due to large n and k affecting factorial computations!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Integrate the Checkers into the Original Program

Let's integrate these checker functions into the provided C++ solution:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

const int K = 5e3 + 5, MOD = 1e9 + 7;
int n, k, s2[K][K], fac1[K], fac2[K], inv[K], ans;

inline void inc(int &a, int b) { (a += b) >= MOD ? a -= MOD : a; }
inline int qsm(int a, int b) {
    int ans = 1;
    while (b) {
        if (b & 1) ans = 1ll * ans * a % MOD;
        a = 1ll * a * a % MOD;
        b >>= 1;
    }
    return ans;
}
inline int C(int j) {
    return j < 0 || j > n ? 0 : 1ll * fac1[j] * inv[j] % MOD;
}

// Checker for Stirling numbers computation
void check_stirling_invariant(int k) {
    if (k >= 4500) {
        cerr << "Warning: Potential slowdown due to large k in Stirling numbers computation!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Checker for modular exponentiation
void check_modular_exponentiation_invariant(int n, int k) {
    if (n > (1 << 20)) {
        cerr << "Warning: Potential slowdown due to excessive calls to modular exponentiation!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Checker for factorial computations
void check_factorial_invariant(int n, int k) {
    if (n > 1e8 && k > 4500) {
        cerr << "Warning: Potential slowdown due to large n and k affecting factorial computations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    cin >> n >> k;

    // Implement checkers
    check_stirling_invariant(k);
    check_modular_exponentiation_invariant(n, k);
    check_factorial_invariant(n, k);

    fac1[0] = 1;
    for (register int i = 1; i <= k; ++i)
        fac1[i] = 1ll * fac1[i - 1] * (n - i + 1) % MOD;
    fac2[0] = 1;
    for (register int i = 1; i <= k; ++i) fac2[i] = 1ll * fac2[i - 1] * i % MOD;
    inv[k] = qsm(fac2[k], MOD - 2);
    for (register int i = k - 1; i >= 0; --i)
        inv[i] = 1ll * inv[i + 1] * (i + 1) % MOD;
    if (n <= k) {
        for (register int i = 0; i <= n; ++i)
            inc(ans, 1ll * C(i) * qsm(i, k) % MOD);
        return printf("%d\n", ans), 0;
    }
    s2[0][0] = 1;
    for (register int i = 1; i <= k; ++i)
        for (register int j = 1; j <= i; ++j)
            s2[i][j] = s2[i - 1][j - 1], inc(s2[i][j], 1ll * s2[i - 1][j] * j % MOD);
    for (register int i = 0; i <= k; ++i)
        inc(ans, 1ll * fac2[i] * C(i) % MOD * s2[k][i] % MOD * qsm(2, n - i) % MOD);
    printf("%d\n", ans);
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

- **Check Placement:** The checkers are placed right after reading inputs, ensuring they catch potential performance bottlenecks before any heavy computation begins.
- **Thresholds:** Chosen thresholds are set to capture conditions that could lead to inefficiencies without being overly restrictive.
- **Abort on Trigger:** The program will abort and provide a warning message if any checker's condition is met, aiding in debugging and performance tuning.
