### Phase 1: Identifying Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

Upon comparing the line-level hit counts for the slow and fast inputs, we identify the following insights:

1. **Function `power`:** This function is called many more times with the slow input, totaling 47,922 hits for loop conditions compared to 23,863 with the fast input. This indicates that the exponentiation operation is a hotspot, particularly the while-loop responsible for exponentiation by squaring.

2. **Nested Loops for Coefficient Calculation:** 
   - The nested loop starting at line 44 is executed significantly more times for the slow input than for the fast input (7,428,584 vs. 0 hits, respectively). This loop computes binomial coefficients using dynamic programming and is very expensive with the slow input.
   - Further, the nested loop starting at line 53 is also a hotspot, with 7,405,476 hits in the slow run, indicating heavy computations involving multiplication and modulus operations.

3. **Conditional Branching:**
   - Lines 35-42 are only executed in the fast run since `n < k`. For the slow input, where `n >= k`, the branching results in a different and more complex computation path.

### Phase 2: Deriving Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the analysis, the performance bottlenecks are primarily due to the complex calculations involving exponentiation and binomial coefficients. Here are the performance-characterizing invariants:

1. **Exponentiation Complexity:**
   - **Natural Language Invariant:** "If the exponentiation operation (in `power` function) is called with a large difference between `n` and `k`, the computation becomes significantly expensive due to repeated multiplication and modulus operations."
   
2. **Coefficient Computation Overhead:**
   - **Natural Language Invariant:** "When calculating binomial coefficients using nested loops, if `k` is large, the nested loop may perform excessive iterations leading to increased computation time."
   
3. **Multiplicative Combinations:**
   - **Natural Language Invariant:** "The presence of nested loops that involve multiplying large entities like `(n - j)` with dynamic coefficients can lead to performance degradation if `k` approaches its upper constraint."

4. **Conditional Path Selection:**
   - **Natural Language Invariant:** "The path that involves computing coefficients and powers when `n >= k` is significantly more complex and leads to slow performance, especially with higher values of `k`."

These invariants highlight that the slow path is primarily triggered by high values of `k` relative to the complexity of combinations and exponentiations performed within the nested loops. Future slowdowns are likely when `n` and `k` are such that complex paths are more frequently executed, causing an increased number of operations and large memory footprints.

### Phase 3: Implementing Checker Code in C++

Below are the C++ code snippets that implement the performance-characterizing invariants identified in the previous phase:

1. **Exponentiation Complexity Checker:**
   ```cpp
   void check_exponentiation_invariant(long long n, long long k) {
       if (n - k > 5000) { // Assuming a threshold for complexity based on problem constraints
           cerr << "Warning: Exponentiation invariant triggered - large difference leading to expensive operations!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Coefficient Computation Overhead Checker:**
   ```cpp
   void check_coefficient_invariant(long long k) {
       if (k > 3000) { // Assuming a threshold as a significant portion of the upper limit
           cerr << "Warning: Coefficient invariant triggered - large k value leading to excessive iterations!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Multiplicative Combinations Checker:**
   ```cpp
   void check_multiplicative_invariant(long long n, long long k) {
       if (n > 4000 && k > 2000) { // Assuming conditions where multiplicative operations explode
           cerr << "Warning: Multiplicative invariant triggered - large n and k causing performance degradation!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

4. **Conditional Path Selection Checker:**
   ```cpp
   void check_conditional_path_invariant(long long n, long long k) {
       if (n >= k && k > 2500) { // Where conditional path selection causes complexity
           cerr << "Warning: Conditional path invariant triggered - n >= k with large k causing complex execution path!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Integrating Checker Code into the Original Program

The following is the instrumented version of the original C++ program with the integrated performance-checking code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

long long p = 1000000007;
long long fac[100000];
long long coeff[5005][5005];

long long power(long long x, long long y, long long p) {
    p = 1000000007;
    long long res = 1;
    x = x % p;
    while (y > 0) {
        if (y & 1) res = (res * x) % p;
        y = y >> 1;
        x = (x * x) % p;
    }
    return res;
}

long long modInverse(long long n, long long p) {
    return power(n, p - 2, p);
}

long long nCrModPFermat(long long n, long long r, long long p) {
    if (r == 0) return 1;
    long long fac[n + 1];
    fac[0] = 1;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) fac[i] = (fac[i - 1] * i) % p;
    return (fac[n] * modInverse(fac[r], p) % p * modInverse(fac[n - r], p) % p) % p;
}

// Checkers inserted here
void check_exponentiation_invariant(long long n, long long k) {
    if (n - k > 5000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Exponentiation invariant triggered - large difference leading to expensive operations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_coefficient_invariant(long long k) {
    if (k > 3000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Coefficient invariant triggered - large k value leading to excessive iterations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_multiplicative_invariant(long long n, long long k) {
    if (n > 4000 && k > 2000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Multiplicative invariant triggered - large n and k causing performance degradation!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_conditional_path_invariant(long long n, long long k) {
    if (n >= k && k > 2500) {
        cerr << "Warning: Conditional path invariant triggered - n >= k with large k causing complex execution path!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    long long n, k;
    cin >> n >> k;
    p = 1000000007;
    long long fuck = 0;
    coeff[0][0] = 1;

    // Invoke checkers at appropriate points
    check_exponentiation_invariant(n, k);
    check_coefficient_invariant(k);
    check_multiplicative_invariant(n, k);
    check_conditional_path_invariant(n, k);

    if (n < k) {
        long long aaa = 0;
        for (long long i = 0; i < n + 1; i++) {
            aaa = (aaa + (nCrModPFermat(n, i, p) * power(i, k, p)) % 1000000007) % 1000000007;
        }
        cout << aaa;
        return 0;
    }

    for (long long i = 1; i < k + 5; i++) {
        for (long long j = 1; j < i + 1; j++) {
            coeff[i][j] = max(1LL, coeff[i][j]);
            coeff[i][j] = (coeff[i - 1][j] * j + coeff[i - 1][j - 1]) % 1000000007;
        }
    }

    for (long long i = 2; i < k + 1; i++) {
        long long temp = coeff[k][i];
        temp = (temp * power(2, n - i, p)) % 1000000007;
        for (long long j = 1; j < i; j++) {
            temp = (temp * (n - j) + 1000000007) % 1000000007;
        }
        fuck = (fuck + temp) % 1000000007;
    }

    fuck = (fuck + power(2, n - 1, p)) % 1000000007;
    fuck = (fuck * n) % 1000000007;
    cout << fuck << '\n';
}
```

**Note:** The thresholds in the checker functions are assumed based on the given constraints and need careful tuning with actual profiling data.
