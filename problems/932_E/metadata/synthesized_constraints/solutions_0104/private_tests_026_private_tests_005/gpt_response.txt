=== Invariants Response ===
Given the problem and the provided code, let's perform the analysis and derive performance-characterizing invariants.

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Comparison of Line-Level Hit Counts:**
   - The `power` function (lines 4-13) is called frequently with `b` iterations in a loop. The hit counts indicate a large number of calculations, especially for the slow input, due to the high number of iterations in the binary exponentiation process.
   - The nested loop structure in lines 33-40 is also heavily used in the slow input. This is due to `n` being large and the loop iterating over `k` which can be as large as 5000.

2. **Pinpointing Lines with Significant Hits:**
   - The lines within the `power` function and the nested loops in the `else` block (lines 31-44) are heavily impacted for the slow input, indicating a performance bottleneck.
   
3. **Interaction with Data Structures:**
   - The usage of the `ans` array as a binomial coefficient table for `n` up to 5000 in the `if` block (line 19-30) is avoided for large `n` because of the memory limitation.
   - For large `n`, the computation relies on iterative multiplication and array updates within the nested loop, which is where the slowdown occurs due to repetitive calculations.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **Invariants Describing Conditions for Slow Path:**

   - **Invariant 1:** If `n` is greater than 5000 and `k` is large, the number of iterations in the loop increases significantly, causing the nested loops to execute an excessive number of times.
     - *Natural Language Description:* "When `n` is greater than 5000 and `k` approaches its upper limit, the computation becomes intensive due to large repeated iterations in nested loops."

   - **Invariant 2:** The `power` function, which operates in \(O(\log b)\) time, becomes a bottleneck when called repeatedly with large `k` and large numbers of iterations in the surrounding loop.
     - *Natural Language Description:* "If the `power` function is called repeatedly with a large exponent due to high iteration counts caused by large `n` and `k`, it can significantly slow down the program."

2. **Threshold Values Aligned with Constraints:**
   - The threshold values derive from the constraints such as `n > 5000`, which triggers the execution of the `else` block using iterative calculations without relying on precomputed binomial coefficients.

3. **Correlative Statements to Input Patterns:**
   - For `n > 5000`, the performance depends heavily on the computational overhead of the nested loops which grow rapidly with increasing `k`.
   - The use of `power` function within the innermost loop further exacerbates the slow path, especially when `k` is large, resulting in many multiplicative operations.

These invariants help identify the scenarios where the code might experience performance degradation based on the input constraints and structure. They provide clear guidelines for understanding when the program may execute a slow path, allowing for optimizations or alternative strategies to handle such cases efficiently.

=== Checker Response ===
Let's start with Phase 3, where we will translate the natural language invariants into checker code in C++.

### Phase 3: Implement Natural Language Invariants as Checker Code

Based on the performance-characterizing invariants derived earlier, here are the checker implementations:

1. **Invariant 1 Checker:**
   - This checker will ensure that when `n` is greater than 5000 and `k` is large, a warning is produced to indicate potential performance bottlenecks due to excessive iterations in nested loops.
   
   ```cpp
   void check_large_n_k_invariant(int n, int k) {
       if (n > 5000 && k > 4000) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large n and k!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Invariant 2 Checker:**
   - This checker will monitor the `power` function to detect when it is being called excessively with large values, indicating a potential slowdown.
   
   ```cpp
   void check_power_function_invariant(int calls, int k) {
       if (calls > 10000 && k > 4000) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive power function calls!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Integrate Checkers into the Original Program

Now, let's integrate these checks into the original C++ code. We'll place the checks at effective points in the program to avoid any unnecessary overhead.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
const int mod = 1e9 + 7;

int power(int a, int b) {
    int res = 1;
    int call_count = 0; // Track the number of times power is called
    while (b) {
        if (b % 2 != 0) {
            res = (1LL * res * a) % mod;
        }
        a = (1LL * a * a) % mod;
        b /= 2;
        call_count++;
    }
    // Check the invariant for excessive power calls
    check_power_function_invariant(call_count, b);
    return res;
}

void check_large_n_k_invariant(int n, int k) {
    if (n > 5000 && k > 4000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large n and k!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_power_function_invariant(int calls, int k) {
    if (calls > 10000 && k > 4000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive power function calls!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int ans[5005][5005];
int main() {
    int n, k;
    scanf("%d%d", &n, &k);

    // Check the invariant for large n and k
    check_large_n_k_invariant(n, k);
    
    if (n <= 5000) {
        int answer = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
            ans[i][0] = 1;
            for (int j = 1; j <= i; j++) {
                ans[i][j] = (ans[i - 1][j - 1] + ans[i - 1][j]) % mod;
            }
        }
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            answer = (answer + (1LL * ans[n][i] * power(i, k)) % mod) % mod;
        }
        printf("%d\n", answer);
    } else {
        int prev = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i <= k; i++) {
            for (int d = 0; d <= k; d++) {
                if (i == 1) {
                    prev = (1LL * prev * (n - d)) % mod;
                    ans[1][d] = (1LL * prev * power(2, n - d - 1)) % mod;
                } else {
                    ans[i][d] =
                        ((1LL * (d + 1) * ans[i - 1][d]) % mod + ans[i - 1][d + 1]) % mod;
                }
            }
        }
        printf("%d\n", ans[k][0]);
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Invariant 1** is checked right after reading `n` and `k`, ensuring that the program does not proceed if the invariant is triggered.
- **Invariant 2** is checked within the `power` function to capture excessive calls dynamically as they occur.
- These checks provide warnings and terminate execution when potential bottlenecks are detected, aiding in identifying performance issues during testing.
