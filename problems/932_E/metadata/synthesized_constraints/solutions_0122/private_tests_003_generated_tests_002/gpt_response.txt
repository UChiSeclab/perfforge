## Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

### Analysis of Hit Counts

1. **Line 3 (`add` function call):** 
   - Slow: 7,413,174 hits
   - Fast: 3,849 hits
   - This function is called significantly more in the slow input, primarily due to its use in the nested loop for constructing Stirling numbers.

2. **Line 5 (`mul` function call):** 
   - Slow: 7,488,547 hits
   - Fast: 81,510 hits
   - Similarly, `mul` is heavily used throughout the program, especially in nested loops and exponentiation operations.

3. **Line 8 (qpow loop):** 
   - Slow: 47,922 hits
   - Fast: 50,068 hits
   - This line executes the qpow function, which is used for exponentiation by squaring. It shows moderate difference between slow and fast, but not as significant as others.

4. **Line 33 (Second nested loop on Stirling numbers):** 
   - Slow: 7,413,174 hits
   - Fast: 0 hits
   - The nested loop constructing Stirling numbers of the second kind is a major contributor to the slow performance. It grows with `k`, leading to a quadratic number of operations.

5. **Line 36 (Loop for cost calculation):**
   - Slow: 3,850 hits
   - Fast: 0 hits
   - This loop calculates the final answer using Stirling numbers, also contributing to the slowness when `k` is large.

### Inference

- The main performance bottleneck arises from the nested loops that compute and utilize Stirling numbers of the second kind. This particularly affects scenarios where `k` is large, as these loops operate in a quadratic fashion relative to `k`.

## Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

### Natural Language Invariants

1. **Nested Loop Invariant:**
   - "When `k` is large, the nested loops for computing Stirling numbers can become a dominant factor in execution time, especially since they scale quadratically with respect to `k`."
   
2. **Exponentiation Invariant:**
   - "When both `n` and `k` are large, the repeated exponentiation operations can further compound the computational load, as they are executed multiple times in a nested context."

3. **Quadratic Calculation Bottleneck:**
   - "If `k` approaches its upper limit, the computation of subsets using Stirling numbers and subsequent calculations may result in a quadratic growth in operations, leading to slowdowns."

### Thresholds and Conditions

- **Thresholds for `k`:** As `k` approaches its upper bound (5000), the number of calculations involving Stirling numbers and exponentiations increases quadratically, leading to significant slowdowns.
- **Interaction with Inputs:** The slowdown is not directly due to `n` exceeding typical constraints but rather due to the large `k` value, which induces heavy calculations even for moderate `n`.

### Summary

The program experiences performance degradation primarily due to the quadratic growth in Stirling number computations when `k` is large. The combination of large `k` and moderately large `n` can lead to a significant increase in operations, heavily affecting performance.

=== Checker Response ===
## Phase 3: Implementing Performance-Characterizing Invariants in C++

Based on the natural language invariants derived earlier, here are the C++ checkers:

```cpp
// Checker to detect if k is large, potentially causing slow quadratic operations
void check_stirling_invariant(int k) {
    if (k > 4000) { // Threshold chosen considering upper limit and problem context
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large k causing heavy Stirling number computations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Checker to detect potential performance issues from large exponentiation operations
void check_exponentiation_invariant(int n, int k) {
    if (n > 100000 && k > 1000) { // Arbitrary threshold to detect performance impact
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large n and k causing repeated exponentiation!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

## Phase 4: Integrating Checks into the Original Program

Here's the original C++ code with integrated performance checkers:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
const int MOD = 1000000007;
inline int add(int a, int b) { return (a += b) >= MOD ? a - MOD : a; }
inline int sub(int a, int b) { return (a -= b) < 0 ? a + MOD : a; }
inline int mul(int a, int b) { return 1ll * a * b % MOD; }
inline int qpow(int a, int p) {
  int ret = 1;
  for (p += (p < 0) * (MOD - 1); p; p >>= 1, a = mul(a, a))
    if (p & 1) ret = mul(ret, a);
  return ret;
}
const int MAXN = 5010;
int Strb[MAXN][MAXN];
int fac[MAXN];
int inv[MAXN];
int n, k;

// Checker to detect if k is large, potentially causing slow quadratic operations
void check_stirling_invariant(int k) {
    if (k > 4000) { // Threshold chosen considering upper limit and problem context
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large k causing heavy Stirling number computations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Checker to detect potential performance issues from large exponentiation operations
void check_exponentiation_invariant(int n, int k) {
    if (n > 100000 && k > 1000) { // Arbitrary threshold to detect performance impact
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large n and k causing repeated exponentiation!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
  std::cin >> n >> k;

  // Perform checks for potential bottlenecks
  check_stirling_invariant(k);
  check_exponentiation_invariant(n, k);

  if (n <= k) {
    fac[0] = 1;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) fac[i] = mul(fac[i - 1], i);
    inv[n] = qpow(fac[n], MOD - 2);
    for (int i = n; i >= 1; --i) inv[i - 1] = mul(inv[i], i);
    int ans = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= k; ++i) {
      ans = add(ans, mul(mul(fac[n], mul(inv[i], inv[n - i])), qpow(i, k)));
    }
    printf("%d\n", ans);
    return 0;
  }
  Strb[0][0] = 1;
  for (int i = 1; i <= k; ++i)
    for (int j = 1; j <= i; ++j)
      Strb[i][j] = add(Strb[i - 1][j - 1], mul(j, Strb[i - 1][j]));
  int ans = 0, p = n;
  for (int i = 1; i <= k; p = mul(p, n - i), ++i) {
    ans = add(ans, mul(Strb[k][i], mul(p, qpow(2, n - i))));
  }
  printf("%d\n", ans);
}
```

### Explanation of Integration

- **`check_stirling_invariant`:** This check is placed after reading inputs to capture cases where `k` is large, which can lead to slow operations with Stirling numbers.
- **`check_exponentiation_invariant`:** This check is also placed after input reading to intercept scenarios where both `n` and `k` are large, potentially causing repeated and expensive exponentiation operations.
- **Thresholds:** The thresholds in the checks reflect heuristic limits based on problem constraints and observed behavior in the analysis. These help in identifying potential performance bottlenecks early in execution.
