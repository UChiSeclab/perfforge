=== Invariants Response ===
To diagnose the performance issues in the given C code, let's follow the required analysis phases:

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Compare Line-Level Hit Counts:**
   - The `mypow` function is heavily used in both fast and slow inputs, but significantly more in the slow input (`slow_hit_count: 47922` vs. `fast_hit_count: 4147`).
   - Lines 30 to 46 inside the main logic for handling `n >= k` are heavily hit for the slow input but not at all for the fast input. This suggests that the slowdown arises when dealing with larger values of `n`.

2. **Pinpoint Lines with More Hits in Slow Input:**
   - The loop starting at line 31 is hit `3850` times for the slow input and not at all for the fast input, indicating that this part of the code is critical for larger `n`.
   - Nested loops at lines 34 and 45 result in millions of hits for the slow input (`7413174` and `7417025`, respectively), indicating inefficient operations likely due to combinations of `i` and `j`.

3. **Interaction with Data Structures:**
   - Array `T` is used for binomial coefficient calculations and is manipulated heavily in loops, particularly lines 34-38 and lines 45-46. The constant recalculation and updates suggest potential inefficiencies, especially when dealing with large values of `k` and `n`.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **Generate Natural Language Statements:**

   - **Invariant 1: Exponential Growth in Combinations**
     - Natural Language Description: "The performance degrades significantly when `n` is large because the number of combinations to process grows exponentially, especially when `n` approaches or exceeds `k`. This results in nested loops handling large matrices of combinations."
   
   - **Invariant 2: Expensive Power Computations**
     - Natural Language Description: "The use of recursive power computations in `mypow` is a bottleneck when repeatedly calculating powers for large `n`. The recursive nature of `mypow` results in deep recursion and excessive recomputation."

2. **Avoid Using Specific Numeric Values:**
   - These invariants are formulated to abstract general categories such as "large `n`" or "exponential growth in combinations," avoiding reliance on specific numbers from the input.

3. **Correlate Conditions to Input Patterns:**
   - The slow paths are triggered when `n` is close to `k` and large, leading to exponential combinations and recursion depth in power calculations, highlighting the inefficiency in handling these specific constraints.

4. **Realistic Triggers Given Constraints:**
   - Given the constraints (`n <= 10^9` and `k <= 5000`), scenarios with `n` significantly greater than `k` especially near upper bounds like `k` can be expected to trigger these slow paths due to the sheer number of combination computations and repeated recursive power calculations.

These insights can help focus optimizations on reducing the calculation overhead in these scenarios, perhaps through iterative power computation or optimizing combination calculations when `n` is large.

=== Checker Response ===
Certainly! Let's implement the natural language invariants as runtime checks in C++.

### Phase 3: Implement the Natural Language Invariants in C++

**Invariant 1: Exponential Growth in Combinations**
- This invariant suggests that when `n` is large and approaches or exceeds `k`, the program should warn about exponential growth in combinations being computed.

```cpp
void check_combination_invariant(long long n, long long k) {
    if (n > k) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to exponential growth in combinations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

**Invariant 2: Expensive Power Computations**
- This invariant suggests that the computation of powers could be expensive if `mypow` is invoked repeatedly with large values.

```cpp
void check_power_invariant(long long n, long long k) {
    if (n > 1000 && k > 1000) { // Example threshold for large n and k
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to expensive power computations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrate Conditional Checks in the Original Program

Here's how you can integrate these checks into the C++ program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
const long long mod = 1e9 + 7;
long long K[5050], D[5050];
int T[5050][5050];
long long n, k, ans;

long long mypow(long long a, long long b) {
    if (!b) return 1;
    long long ret = mypow(a, b >> 1);
    ret *= ret;
    ret %= mod;
    return ret * (b & 1 ? a : 1) % mod;
}

void check_combination_invariant(long long n, long long k) {
    if (n > k) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to exponential growth in combinations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_power_invariant(long long n, long long k) {
    if (n > 1000 && k > 1000) { // Example threshold for large n and k
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to expensive power computations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    long long i, j, s;
    scanf("%lld%lld", &n, &k);

    // Check for exponential growth in combinations
    check_combination_invariant(n, k);

    // Check for expensive power computations
    check_power_invariant(n, k);

    if (n < k) {
        T[0][0] = 1;
        for (i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            T[i][0] = 1;
            for (j = 1; j <= i; j++)
                T[i][j] = ((long long)T[i - 1][j] + (long long)T[i - 1][j - 1]) % mod;
        }
        for (i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
            ans = (ans + (long long)T[n][i] * mypow(i, k)) % mod;
        }
        printf("%lld\n", ans);
        return 0;
    }
    T[0][0] = s = 1;
    for (i = 1; i <= k; i++) {
        s = s * (n - i + 1) % mod;
        K[i] = (s * mypow(2, n - i)) % mod;
        for (j = 0; j < i; j++) {
            T[i][j] = (((long long)T[i][j] - (i - 1) * (long long)T[i - 1][j]) % mod + mod) % mod;
            T[i][j + 1] = ((long long)T[i][j + 1] + (long long)T[i - 1][j]) % mod;
        }
    }
    D[k] = -1;
    for (i = k; i >= 0; i--) {
        s = -D[i];
        ans = ((ans + s * K[i]) % mod + mod) % mod;
        for (j = 0; j <= i; j++)
            D[j] = ((D[j] + s * (long long)T[i][j]) % mod + mod) % mod;
    }
    printf("%lld\n", ans);
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

- **Invariant 1 Check:** Placed after reading inputs. It detects large values of `n` relative to `k`, which can cause performance issues due to the exponential growth in combination calculations.
- **Invariant 2 Check:** Also placed after reading inputs to detect large values that could make the `mypow` function expensive due to large recursion depth.

These checks will help identify performance bottlenecks during runtime when `n` is large or when expensive power computations are repeatedly invoked.
