=== Invariants Response ===
Based on the given C program and the hit count information, let's analyze and derive performance-characterizing invariants.

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Function `qpow(long long a, long long k)`**:
   - This function is called frequently in both fast and slow inputs, but it is called significantly more for the slow input (`9,150` vs. `1,044`).
   - The `while (k)` loop within this function has a large number of iterations (`265,350` for slow vs. `22,446` for fast), indicating that the power computation is a major contributor to the slowdown.

2. **Stirling Number Calculation**:
   - The nested loop lines 30-32 are not hit at all during the fast input but have an extremely high hit count during the slow input (`10,472,175` hits for `j` loop).
   - This part of the code computes Stirling numbers of the second kind, which are used when `n > k`.

3. **Loop in the Main Function**:
   - The loop starting at line 37 is executed `4,576` times for the slow input and not at all for the fast input, contributing to the overall slowdown.
   - Inside this loop, the `qpow` function is invoked again, indicating repeated use of an expensive calculation.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

From the analysis, we can derive the following natural language invariants that characterize when the program runs slowly:

1. **Power Computation Bottleneck**:
   - **Invariant**: "When `n` is much larger than `k` and both are large, the repeated computation of powers becomes a significant bottleneck, particularly if `qpow` is called frequently in a loop context."
   - **Justification**: The function `qpow` is expensive due to its iterative squaring method, and with larger values of `n` and multiple loop iterations, it contributes significantly to runtime.

2. **Stirling Number Calculation Overhead**:
   - **Invariant**: "If `n > k`, the computation of Stirling numbers of the second kind can be very costly, especially when `k` is large, resulting in extensive nested loops."
   - **Justification**: The inner loop for building the Stirling numbers is hit an enormous number of times, indicating that this part of the code is very sensitive to the size of `k` when `n > k`.

3. **Loop Dependency on Large `n`**:
   - **Invariant**: "When `n` is significantly larger than `k`, the loop that calculates the sum of subset costs tends to perform numerous operations, leading to performance degradation."
   - **Justification**: The loop on line 37 iterates based on `k` but its contents involve calculations dependent on `n`, which when large, extends processing time significantly in conjunction with power computations.

These invariants help identify patterns in the input that are likely to cause performance issues, allowing us to focus optimizations or monitoring on these specific cases.

=== Checker Response ===
### Phase 3: Implementing Natural Language Invariants in C++

Here are the C++ code snippets that check the performance-characterizing invariants:

1. **Power Computation Bottleneck**:
   ```cpp
   void check_power_computation_invariant(long long n, long long k) {
       if (n > 100000 && k > 1000) { // Using broad parameters as indicative thresholds
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive power computation!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Stirling Number Calculation Overhead**:
   ```cpp
   void check_stirling_calculation_invariant(long long n, long long k) {
       if (n > k && k > 3000) { // Using a threshold where n is greater than k and k is moderately large
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - expensive Stirling number calculation!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Loop Dependency on Large `n`**:
   ```cpp
   void check_large_n_invariant(long long n, long long k) {
       if (n > 500000 && n > k) { // Large n relative to k
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large n loop dependency!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Integrating the Checks into the Original Program

Here is the final instrumented C++ code with the performance-checking functions integrated:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
const int maxn = 5000 + 10;
const int mod = 1000000000 + 7;
long long S[maxn][maxn];

long long qpow(long long a, long long k) {
    long long res = 1;
    while (k) {
        if (k & 1) {
            res = res * a % mod;
        }
        a = a * a % mod;
        k >>= 1;
    }
    return res;
}

long long inv(long long x) { return qpow(x, mod - 2); }

// Performance invariant checks
void check_power_computation_invariant(long long n, long long k) {
    if (n > 100000 && k > 1000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive power computation!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_stirling_calculation_invariant(long long n, long long k) {
    if (n > k && k > 3000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - expensive Stirling number calculation!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_large_n_invariant(long long n, long long k) {
    if (n > 500000 && n > k) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large n loop dependency!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    int n, k;
    scanf("%d %d", &n, &k);
    
    // Insert checks right after reading input
    check_power_computation_invariant(n, k);
    check_stirling_calculation_invariant(n, k);
    check_large_n_invariant(n, k);
    
    if (n <= k) {
        long long ans = 0, c = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            c = c * (n - i + 1) % mod * inv(i) % mod;
            ans = (ans + c * qpow(i, k) % mod) % mod;
        }
        printf("%lld\n", ans);
    } else {
        S[0][0] = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i <= k; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= i; j++) {
                S[i][j] = (S[i - 1][j - 1] + j * S[i - 1][j]) % mod;
            }
        }
        long long ans = 0;
        long long t1 = 1, t2 = 1;
        for (int j = 1; j <= k; j++) {
            t1 = t1 * j % mod;
            t2 = t2 * (n - j + 1) % mod * inv(j) % mod;
            ans = (ans + S[k][j] * t1 % mod * t2 % mod * qpow(2, n - j) % mod) % mod;
        }
        printf("%lld\n", ans);
    }
    getchar();
    getchar();
    return 0;
}
```

This code integrates the invariant checks effectively, ensuring that potential performance bottlenecks are detected at runtime for input scenarios likely to cause slow execution.
