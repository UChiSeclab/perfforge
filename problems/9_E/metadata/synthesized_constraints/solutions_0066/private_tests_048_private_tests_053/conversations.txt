system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

Hexadecimal likes drawing. She has drawn many graphs already, both directed and not. Recently she has started to work on a still-life «interesting graph and apples». An undirected graph is called interesting, if each of its vertices belongs to one cycle only — a funny ring — and does not belong to any other cycles. A funny ring is a cycle that goes through all the vertices just once. Moreover, loops are funny rings too.

She has already drawn the apples and some of the graph edges. But now it is not clear, how to connect the rest of the vertices to get an interesting graph as a result. The answer should contain the minimal amount of added edges. And furthermore, the answer should be the lexicographically smallest one. The set of edges (x1, y1), (x2, y2), ..., (xn, yn), where xi ≤ yi, is lexicographically smaller than the set (u1, v1), (u2, v2), ..., (un, vn), where ui ≤ vi, provided that the sequence of integers x1, y1, x2, y2, ..., xn, yn is lexicographically smaller than the sequence u1, v1, u2, v2, ..., un, vn. If you do not cope, Hexadecimal will eat you. ...eat you alive.

Input

The first line of the input data contains a pair of integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 50, 0 ≤ m ≤ 2500) — the amount of vertices and edges respectively. The following lines contain pairs of numbers xi and yi (1 ≤ xi, yi ≤ n) — the vertices that are already connected by edges. The initial graph may contain multiple edges and loops.

Output

In the first line output «YES» or «NO»: if it is possible or not to construct an interesting graph. If the answer is «YES», in the second line output k — the amount of edges that should be added to the initial graph. Finally, output k lines: pairs of vertices xj and yj, between which edges should be drawn. The result may contain multiple edges and loops. k can be equal to zero.

assistant: To analyze the performance characteristics of the given C program, we will undertake the following steps:

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Compare Line-Level Hit Counts:**
   - The `dfs(int i)` function shows a significant disparity in hit counts between the slow and fast inputs.
   - The slow input leads to a very high number of hits, notably on line 11 (`for (int j = 1; j <= n; ++j)`) and line 12 (`if (g[i][j])`), indicating a large number of recursive calls.

2. **Pinpoint Lines or Functions:**
   - The lines within the `dfs` function, especially the loop iterating over all nodes (line 11) and the recursive call to `dfs(j)` (line 14), highlight a potential performance bottleneck.
   - The `check()` function also shows a pattern where it is invoked many times (line 18 with 40,473 hits in the slow input) and within it, line 20 (`deg &= (d[i] == 2)`) and line 28 (`if (d[i] > 2)`) are hit many times, suggesting these checks are contributing to performance degradation.

3. **Interaction with Data Structures:**
   - The graph is represented using adjacency matrices, and the degree array `d[]` is heavily accessed and modified. Operations iterating over these structures contribute to the slowdown, especially in dense graphs.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the analysis, we can derive the following natural language invariants that characterize the slow performance path of the program:

1. **Invariant on Graph Density and Recursion:**
   - "When the number of edges is low relative to the number of vertices, the recursive depth of the DFS increases due to sparse connectivity, significantly slowing down the algorithm."

2. **Invariant on Degree Checks:**
   - "When there are multiple vertices with degrees not equal to two, the algorithm performs extensive checks, particularly in the `check()` function, causing performance degradation due to repeated validation attempts."

3. **Invariant on Graph Traversals:**
   - "If the graph's degree distribution is irregular and many vertices need to be checked multiple times, especially in nested loops over graph nodes, the algorithm can slow considerably due to redundant operations."

4. **Invariant on Lexicographic Ordering:**
   - "The lexicographical ordering check within loops can lead to performance issues if the graph structure requires evaluating many candidate edges or configurations to find the minimal set of additional edges."

These natural language invariants provide insight into the conditions under which the program enters a slow path, focusing on graph density, degree irregularities, and excessive recursive or iterative checks against the constraints `(n <= 50, m <= 2500)`. They abstract the specific trigger conditions without relying on exact values from the slow input, offering a broad yet relevant description of potential performance bottlenecks.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
Hexadecimal likes drawing. She has drawn many graphs already, both directed and not. Recently she has started to work on a still-life «interesting graph and apples». An undirected graph is called interesting, if each of its vertices belongs to one cycle only — a funny ring — and does not belong to any other cycles. A funny ring is a cycle that goes through all the vertices just once. Moreover, loops are funny rings too.

She has already drawn the apples and some of the graph edges. But now it is not clear, how to connect the rest of the vertices to get an interesting graph as a result. The answer should contain the minimal amount of added edges. And furthermore, the answer should be the lexicographically smallest one. The set of edges (x1, y1), (x2, y2), ..., (xn, yn), where xi ≤ yi, is lexicographically smaller than the set (u1, v1), (u2, v2), ..., (un, vn), where ui ≤ vi, provided that the sequence of integers x1, y1, x2, y2, ..., xn, yn is lexicographically smaller than the sequence u1, v1, u2, v2, ..., un, vn. If you do not cope, Hexadecimal will eat you. ...eat you alive.

Input

The first line of the input data contains a pair of integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 50, 0 ≤ m ≤ 2500) — the amount of vertices and edges respectively. The following lines contain pairs of numbers xi and yi (1 ≤ xi, yi ≤ n) — the vertices that are already connected by edges. The initial graph may contain multiple edges and loops.

Output

In the first line output «YES» or «NO»: if it is possible or not to construct an interesting graph. If the answer is «YES», in the second line output k — the amount of edges that should be added to the initial graph. Finally, output k lines: pairs of vertices xj and yj, between which edges should be drawn. The result may contain multiple edges and loops. k can be equal to zero.

assistant: Let's implement the performance-characterizing invariants as runtime checks in C++. 

### Phase 3: Implementing Checker Code in C++

Here are the checks based on the previously derived invariants in natural language, converted to C++ code:

1. **Invariant on Graph Density and Recursion:**
   ```cpp
   void check_recursion_invariant(bool condition) {
       if (condition) {
           cerr << "Warning: Recursion invariant triggered - excessive depth due to sparse connectivity!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Invariant on Degree Checks:**
   ```cpp
   void check_degree_invariant(bool condition) {
       if (condition) {
           cerr << "Warning: Degree invariant triggered - many vertices with degrees not equal to two!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Invariant on Graph Traversals:**
   ```cpp
   void check_traversal_invariant(bool condition) {
       if (condition) {
           cerr << "Warning: Traversal invariant triggered - excessive checks or redundant operations detected!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

4. **Invariant on Lexicographic Ordering:**
   ```cpp
   void check_lexicographic_invariant(bool condition) {
       if (condition) {
           cerr << "Warning: Lexicographic invariant triggered - excessive evaluation of candidate edges!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Integrating Checker Code into the Original Program

Here is the original C++ program with the integrated checks:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int n, m, d[51], g[51][51];
bool v[51], cir;

void check_recursion_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Recursion invariant triggered - excessive depth due to sparse connectivity!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_degree_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Degree invariant triggered - many vertices with degrees not equal to two!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_traversal_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Traversal invariant triggered - excessive checks or redundant operations detected!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_lexicographic_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Lexicographic invariant triggered - excessive evaluation of candidate edges!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void dfs(int i) {
    if (v[i]) {
        cir = true;
        return;
    }
    v[i] = true;
    for (int j = 1; j <= n; ++j)
        if (g[i][j]) {
            g[i][j]--, g[j][i]--;
            dfs(j);
            g[i][j]++, g[j][i]++;
        }
}

bool check() {
    bool deg = true;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) deg &= (d[i] == 2);
    
    // Check for degree invariant
    check_degree_invariant(!deg && std::count_if(d+1, d+n+1, [](int x) { return x > 2; }) > n / 2);

    if (deg) {
        memset(v, 0, sizeof(v));
        dfs(1);
        bool con = true;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) con &= v[i];
        if (con) return true;
    }
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i)
        if (d[i] > 2) return false;
    cir = false;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        memset(v, 0, sizeof(v));
        dfs(i);
    }
    if (cir) return false;
    return true;
}

int main() {
    scanf("%d%d", &n, &m);
    memset(d, 0, sizeof(d));
    memset(g, 0, sizeof(g));
    for (int i = 0; i != m; ++i) {
        int x, y;
        scanf("%d%d", &x, &y);
        d[x]++, d[y]++, g[x][y]++, g[y][x]++;
    }
    
    // Check for recursion invariant
    check_recursion_invariant(n > 20 && m < n / 2);

    if (!check()) {
        printf("NO\n");
        return 0;
    }
    printf("YES\n%d\n", n - m);
    
    for (; m < n; ++m) {
        bool flag = true;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n && flag; ++i)
            for (int j = i; j <= n && flag; ++j) {
                d[i]++, d[j]++, g[i][j]++, g[j][i]++;
                
                // Check for lexicographic invariant
                check_lexicographic_invariant(i > n / 2 && j > n / 2);

                if (check()) {
                    printf("%d %d\n", i, j);
                    flag = false;
                    break;
                }
                d[i]--, d[j]--, g[i][j]--, g[j][i]--;
            }
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

- **Recursion Invariant Check:** Added just before the main execution path to check for excessive recursive depth based on graph density.
- **Degree Invariant Check:** Placed inside the `check()` function to monitor the degrees of vertices.
- **Traversal Invariant Check:** Could be invoked similarly; however, it's more of a pattern check and overlaps with existing logic.
- **Lexicographic Invariant Check:** Positioned inside the edge addition loop to monitor lexicographic evaluations.

These checks are strategically placed to monitor conditions without adding excessive overhead to tight loops and provide meaningful warnings when potential performance bottlenecks are detected.
