system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

Hexadecimal likes drawing. She has drawn many graphs already, both directed and not. Recently she has started to work on a still-life «interesting graph and apples». An undirected graph is called interesting, if each of its vertices belongs to one cycle only — a funny ring — and does not belong to any other cycles. A funny ring is a cycle that goes through all the vertices just once. Moreover, loops are funny rings too.

She has already drawn the apples and some of the graph edges. But now it is not clear, how to connect the rest of the vertices to get an interesting graph as a result. The answer should contain the minimal amount of added edges. And furthermore, the answer should be the lexicographically smallest one. The set of edges (x1, y1), (x2, y2), ..., (xn, yn), where xi ≤ yi, is lexicographically smaller than the set (u1, v1), (u2, v2), ..., (un, vn), where ui ≤ vi, provided that the sequence of integers x1, y1, x2, y2, ..., xn, yn is lexicographically smaller than the sequence u1, v1, u2, v2, ..., un, vn. If you do not cope, Hexadecimal will eat you. ...eat you alive.

Input

The first line of the input data contains a pair of integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 50, 0 ≤ m ≤ 2500) — the amount of vertices and edges respectively. The following lines contain pairs of numbers xi and yi (1 ≤ xi, yi ≤ n) — the vertices that are already connected by edges. The initial graph may contain multiple edges and loops.

Output

In the first line output «YES» or «NO»: if it is possible or not to construct an interesting graph. If the answer is «YES», in the second line output k — the amount of edges that should be added to the initial graph. Finally, output k lines: pairs of vertices xj and yj, between which edges should be drawn. The result may contain multiple edges and loops. k can be equal to zero.

assistant: ### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

From the hit count data, we can identify several areas in the code that behave differently between the slow and fast inputs:

1. **`dfs` Function (Lines 8 to 18)**:
   - With the slow input, the `dfs` function is called 2,450 times (line 15) compared to 0 times with the fast input.
   - The loop inside `dfs` (line 10) is executed 249,900 times for the slow input versus just 6 times for the fast input.

2. **`check` Function (Lines 19 to 34)**:
   - This function is called 1,276 times for the slow input as opposed to just once for the fast input.
   - The loop inside `check` (line 20) runs 24,699 times for the slow input compared to 3 times for the fast input.

3. **Nested Loop in `main` Function (Lines 58 to 75)**:
   - The nested loop starting at line 58 is executed 1,325 times for the slow input, resulting in corresponding calls to `check` 1,275 times (line 64).

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **High Recursion Depth and Search Space in DFS**:
   - Natural language description: "If the graph contains a sparse connectivity with many disconnected components or isolated vertices, the `dfs` function may be called recursively numerous times, significantly slowing down the execution."
   - Explanation: The `dfs` function's frequent invocation indicates a potential slowdown due to exploring multiple disconnected regions or components in the graph, leading to deep recursion.

2. **Repeated Execution of the Check Function**:
   - Natural language description: "If the graph initially lacks sufficient connectivity to form a single cycle covering all vertices, the `check` function will be invoked repeatedly, as additional edges are considered multiple times, increasing computation time."
   - Explanation: The `check` function assesses graph properties, and its high invocation count suggests that the graph remains unsatisfactory for forming a single cycle. The repeated attempts to add edges (and check feasibility) contribute to the slowdown.

3. **Large Number of Iterations in Nested Loops**:
   - Natural language description: "When the number of vertices is large, the nested loops attempt numerous edge combinations, resulting in repeated checks of graph conditions, which can drastically slow down the program."
   - Explanation: The nested loops in the main function explore potential edge additions. The larger the number of vertices, the more combinations are tried, leading to excessive checks, particularly when existing edges do not quickly lead to a solution.

### Conclusion

These performance-characterizing invariants give insight into why the program slows down under specific conditions. The focus is on graph connectivity and structure rather than just input size, as even with constraints like \(n \leq 50\), insufficient connectivity or structures requiring excessive edge checks can lead to performance bottlenecks.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
Hexadecimal likes drawing. She has drawn many graphs already, both directed and not. Recently she has started to work on a still-life «interesting graph and apples». An undirected graph is called interesting, if each of its vertices belongs to one cycle only — a funny ring — and does not belong to any other cycles. A funny ring is a cycle that goes through all the vertices just once. Moreover, loops are funny rings too.

She has already drawn the apples and some of the graph edges. But now it is not clear, how to connect the rest of the vertices to get an interesting graph as a result. The answer should contain the minimal amount of added edges. And furthermore, the answer should be the lexicographically smallest one. The set of edges (x1, y1), (x2, y2), ..., (xn, yn), where xi ≤ yi, is lexicographically smaller than the set (u1, v1), (u2, v2), ..., (un, vn), where ui ≤ vi, provided that the sequence of integers x1, y1, x2, y2, ..., xn, yn is lexicographically smaller than the sequence u1, v1, u2, v2, ..., un, vn. If you do not cope, Hexadecimal will eat you. ...eat you alive.

Input

The first line of the input data contains a pair of integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 50, 0 ≤ m ≤ 2500) — the amount of vertices and edges respectively. The following lines contain pairs of numbers xi and yi (1 ≤ xi, yi ≤ n) — the vertices that are already connected by edges. The initial graph may contain multiple edges and loops.

Output

In the first line output «YES» or «NO»: if it is possible or not to construct an interesting graph. If the answer is «YES», in the second line output k — the amount of edges that should be added to the initial graph. Finally, output k lines: pairs of vertices xj and yj, between which edges should be drawn. The result may contain multiple edges and loops. k can be equal to zero.

assistant: ### Phase 3: Implementing the Invariants as Checkers in C++

Based on the performance-characterizing invariants derived in natural language, here are the C++ checkers:

1. **High Recursion Depth and Search Space in DFS**:
   
```cpp
void check_dfs_recursion_depth(int depth, int threshold) {
    if (depth > threshold) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to high DFS recursion depth!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

2. **Repeated Execution of the Check Function**:
   
```cpp
void check_repeated_checks(int checkCount, int threshold) {
    if (checkCount > threshold) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to repeated execution of the check function!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

3. **Large Number of Iterations in Nested Loops**:

```cpp
void check_nested_loop_iterations(int vertexCount, int edgeCount) {
    // Assuming a threshold based on some plausible heavy iteration limit
    if (vertexCount * vertexCount > 2500) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to large number of nested loop iterations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrating Checkers into the Original Program

Here is the instrumented C++ code with the integrated checkers:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int g[51][51];
bool vis[51];
int deg[51];
int n, m;
bool has_cir;

// Checker functions for performance bottlenecks
void check_dfs_recursion_depth(int depth, int threshold) {
    if (depth > threshold) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to high DFS recursion depth!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_repeated_checks(int checkCount, int threshold) {
    if (checkCount > threshold) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to repeated execution of the check function!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_nested_loop_iterations(int vertexCount, int edgeCount) {
    if (vertexCount * vertexCount > 2500) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to large number of nested loop iterations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void dfs(int u, int f, int depth) {
    vis[u] = true;
    
    // Check for high recursion depth
    check_dfs_recursion_depth(depth, 50); // Example threshold

    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        if (g[u][i] && i != f || g[u][i] >= 2) {
            if (vis[i])
                has_cir = true;
            else
                dfs(i, u, depth + 1);
        }
    }
}

bool check() {
    // Track number of times 'check' is called
    static int checkCount = 0;
    checkCount++;

    // Check for excessive repeated calls
    check_repeated_checks(checkCount, 1000); // Example threshold

    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        if (deg[i] > 2) return false;
    }
    int comp = 0;
    memset(vis, false, sizeof(vis));
    has_cir = false;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        if (!vis[i]) {
            comp++;
            dfs(i, -1, 1); // Initial recursion depth
        }
    }
    if (comp > 1 && has_cir) return false;
    return true;
}

int main() {
    while (scanf("%d%d", &n, &m) != EOF) {

        // Check for large number of iterations before heavy nested loops
        check_nested_loop_iterations(n, m);

        if (n == 2 && m == 0) {
            printf("YES\n2\n");
            printf("1 2\n1 2\n");
            continue;
        }
        memset(g, 0, sizeof(g));
        memset(deg, 0, sizeof(deg));
        int a, b;
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            scanf("%d%d", &a, &b);
            g[a][b]++;
            g[b][a]++;
            deg[a]++;
            deg[b]++;
        }
        if (!check()) {
            printf("NO\n");
        } else {
            vector<int> a, b;
            printf("YES\n");
            printf("%d\n", n - m);
            for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
                for (int j = i; j <= n; j++) {
                    g[i][j]++;
                    g[j][i]++;
                    deg[i]++;
                    deg[j]++;
                    if (check()) {
                        a.push_back(i);
                        b.push_back(j);
                    } else {
                        deg[i]--;
                        deg[j]--;
                        g[i][j]--;
                        g[j][i]--;
                    }
                }
            }
            for (int i = 0; i < a.size(); i++) printf("%d %d\n", a[i], b[i]);
        }
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:

- **`check_dfs_recursion_depth`**: This checker is called inside the `dfs` function to detect recursion exceeding a certain depth during traversal.
- **`check_repeated_checks`**: This checker monitors the frequency of calls to the `check` function and warns if it exceeds a threshold.
- **`check_nested_loop_iterations`**: This is placed before the nested loops that attempt to add edges, preventing excessive iterations based on the number of vertices. 

These checkers provide runtime alerts for conditions that may lead to performance bottlenecks, assisting in debugging and optimization efforts.
