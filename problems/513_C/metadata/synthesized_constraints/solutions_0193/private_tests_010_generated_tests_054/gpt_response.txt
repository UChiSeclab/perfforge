### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

Based on the hit count information provided:

- **Function `dp` (lines 5-16):** This recursive function is called significantly more often with the slow input compared to the fast one, particularly:
  - Line 5 (`dp` function entry) shows a hit count of 667,695 for the slow input versus 320,568 for the fast input.
  - Line 10 and Line 14, which contain recursion calls, are hit more frequently during the slow input.

- **Nested Loop in `main` function (lines 35-38):**
  - The loop on line 35 iterates from 1 to `H[i]`, and line 38 calls `dp(0, j, 1)`. This loop is executed more than 39,000 times.

The recursion depth and the number of recursive calls from `dp` suggest that the slow input involves deeper recursive exploration or more frequent recursive calls due to how the bidding ranges affect `M` and `s` calculations.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **Wide Ranges with High Upper Bounds:**
   - **Natural Language Invariant:** "When the difference between `Ri` and `Li` (i.e., the bidding range) is large, and `Ri` is also high for multiple companies, the recursive exploration in the `dp` function becomes extensive, potentially triggering slow performance."
   - **Explanation:** Large ranges increase the potential values for `M`, leading to more scenarios to check recursively.

2. **Similar High Bids Across Companies:**
   - **Natural Language Invariant:** "If multiple companies have similar high ranges that overlap significantly, the computation of expected payments requires more recursive evaluations, which may slow down the program."
   - **Explanation:** Overlapping high bids mean more potential tie scenarios, leading to complex recursive evaluations to determine the expected second-highest bid.

3. **High Value of `H[i]`:**
   - **Natural Language Invariant:** "If the maximum value `H[i]` of the company's bid range is close to the upper limit (10,000), the loops in the code iterate more times, increasing the depth and frequency of recursive calls."
   - **Explanation:** High `H[i]` values increase the iterations in the loop in `main`, which in turn calls `dp` many times, contributing to the slowdown.

These invariants are associated with how the input structure (particularly the range and maximum bid values) impacts recursive calculations and loop iterations. The focus is on the interaction between input constraints and the nested recursive calls, which are key contributors to the slowdown observed with the slow input.

### Phase 3: Implement the Natural Language Invariants in C++

Let's implement the checker code based on the performance-characterizing invariants identified earlier.

1. **Wide Ranges with High Upper Bounds:**

```cpp
void check_large_range_invariant(int L[], int H[], int n) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        if ((H[i] - L[i] > 8000) && H[i] > 9000) {
            cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large range with high upper bounds!" << endl;
            abort();
        }
    }
}
```

2. **Similar High Bids Across Companies:**

```cpp
void check_similar_high_bids(int L[], int H[], int n) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j < n; ++j) {
            if (abs(H[i] - H[j]) < 500 && H[i] > 8000 && H[j] > 8000) {
                cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - similar high bids across companies!" << endl;
                abort();
            }
        }
    }
}
```

3. **High Value of `H[i]`:**

```cpp
void check_high_H_value(int H[], int n) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        if (H[i] > 9500) {
            cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high value of H[i]!" << endl;
            abort();
        }
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrate the Checker Code into the C++ Program

Now, let's integrate these checks into the provided solution:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int LO[10], HI[10];
int SN;

double dp(int id, int M, int s) {
    if (id == SN) return s <= 0 ? 1 : 0;
    double r = 0;
    double den = (HI[id] - LO[id] + 1);
    if (LO[id] <= M && M <= HI[id]) {
        r += 1.0 / den * dp(id + 1, M, s - 1);
    }
    if (LO[id] < M) {
        double num = HI[id] < M ? den : (M - LO[id]);
        r += num / den * dp(id + 1, M, s);
    }
    return r;
}

void check_large_range_invariant(int L[], int H[], int n) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        if ((H[i] - L[i] > 8000) && H[i] > 9000) {
            cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large range with high upper bounds!" << endl;
            abort();
        }
    }
}

void check_similar_high_bids(int L[], int H[], int n) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j < n; ++j) {
            if (abs(H[i] - H[j]) < 500 && H[i] > 8000 && H[j] > 8000) {
                cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - similar high bids across companies!" << endl;
                abort();
            }
        }
    }
}

void check_high_H_value(int H[], int n) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        if (H[i] > 9500) {
            cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high value of H[i]!" << endl;
            abort();
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    int L[10], H[10];
    int N;
    cin >> N;
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        cin >> L[i] >> H[i];
    }

    // Insert performance checks after reading input
    check_large_range_invariant(L, H, N);
    check_similar_high_bids(L, H, N);
    check_high_H_value(H, N);

    double ex = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        int id = 0;
        for (int j = 0; j < N; ++j) {
            if (i == j) continue;
            LO[id] = L[j];
            HI[id] = H[j];
            id++;
        }
        SN = N - 1;
        for (int j = 1; j < H[i]; ++j) {
            double den = H[i] - L[i] + 1;
            double p = j < L[i] ? 1 : (1.0 * (H[i] - j) / den);
            ex += j * dp(0, j, 1) * p;
        }
    }
    SN = N;
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        LO[i] = L[i];
        HI[i] = H[i];
    }
    for (int i = 1; i <= 10000; ++i) {
        ex += i * dp(0, i, 2);
    }
    printf("%0.10lf\n", ex);
}
```

### Explanation

- **After Input Reading:** The checks are placed right after we read the input values. This ensures that the program immediately checks for problematic input patterns that could cause slowdowns.
- **Avoiding Overhead in Loops:** The checks are not inside any computation loops to avoid additional performance overhead during execution.
- **Abort on Condition:** If any condition is met that suggests a potential performance bottleneck, an error message is output, and the program aborts to signal the issue.
