system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

Nowadays, most of the internet advertisements are not statically linked to a web page. Instead, what will be shown to the person opening a web page is determined within 100 milliseconds after the web page is opened. Usually, multiple companies compete for each ad slot on the web page in an auction. Each of them receives a request with details about the user, web page and ad slot and they have to respond within those 100 milliseconds with a bid they would pay for putting an advertisement on that ad slot. The company that suggests the highest bid wins the auction and gets to place its advertisement. If there are several companies tied for the highest bid, the winner gets picked at random.

However, the company that won the auction does not have to pay the exact amount of its bid. In most of the cases, a second-price auction is used. This means that the amount paid by the company is equal to the maximum of all the other bids placed for this ad slot.

Let's consider one such bidding. There are n companies competing for placing an ad. The i-th of these companies will bid an integer number of microdollars equiprobably randomly chosen from the range between Li and Ri, inclusive. In the other words, the value of the i-th company bid can be any integer from the range [Li, Ri] with the same probability. 

Determine the expected value that the winner will have to pay in a second-price auction.

Input

The first line of input contains an integer number n (2 ≤ n ≤ 5). n lines follow, the i-th of them containing two numbers Li and Ri (1 ≤ Li ≤ Ri ≤ 10000) describing the i-th company's bid preferences.

This problem doesn't have subproblems. You will get 8 points for the correct submission.

Output

Output the answer with absolute or relative error no more than 1e - 9.

Examples

Input

3
4 7
8 10
5 5


Output

5.7500000000


Input

3
2 5
3 4
1 6


Output

3.5000000000

Note

Consider the first example. The first company bids a random integer number of microdollars in range [4, 7]; the second company bids between 8 and 10, and the third company bids 5 microdollars. The second company will win regardless of the exact value it bids, however the price it will pay depends on the value of first company's bid. With probability 0.5 the first company will bid at most 5 microdollars, and the second-highest price of the whole auction will be 5. With probability 0.25 it will bid 6 microdollars, and with probability 0.25 it will bid 7 microdollars. Thus, the expected value the second company will have to pay is 0.5·5 + 0.25·6 + 0.25·7 = 5.75.

assistant: ### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Analyzing Line-level Hit Counts**:
   - **Significant Difference**: 
     - The line `for (int k = 1; k < (1 << v.size()); k++)` (line 33) shows a significant increase in hit count for the slow input (168,044 vs. 12,108).
     - Similarly, lines inside this loop, such as `double e = 1, div = 0;` (line 34), `if (k & (1 << l1))` (line 36), and `tot += 1 / (div + 1) * e * i * 1 / len[j];` (line 43) exhibit much higher hit counts for the slow input.

2. **Understanding the Code**:
   - **Nested Loops and Combinatorial Explosion**:
     - The nesting at line 33 involves iterating over subsets of a vector `v`. The size of `v` determines how many iterations occur, as it iterates over `2^v.size()` combinations.
   - **Conditions and Constraints**:
     - This loop becomes expensive particularly when `v.size()` increases, leading to a combinatorial explosion of the subset iteration.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **Performance Invariant Descriptions**:
   
   - **Invariant 1: Combination Explosion in Subset Evaluation**:
     - **Natural Language**: "If multiple companies have overlapping bid ranges that are large, the program may slow down significantly due to the exponential increase in subset combinations to evaluate."
     - **Explanation**: When bidders have ranges that lead to a large set `v`, the code evaluates a large number of combinations, causing slowdown.

   - **Invariant 2: High Overlap in Bid Ranges**:
     - **Natural Language**: "When multiple companies have bid ranges that heavily overlap, the program iterates through a large number of combinations, significantly increasing execution time."
     - **Explanation**: Overlapping bid ranges increase the number of combinations to consider, leading to more iterations in the nested loop.

   - **Invariant 3: Large Range Sizes in Competitive Bids**:
     - **Natural Language**: "The program's performance degrades when one or more companies have bid ranges that permit many potential maximum bids, especially when evaluated against others with similar ranges."
     - **Explanation**: If the bid ranges are large, especially when other companies have similar ranges, the possibility space of bids grows, increasing computational complexity.

2. **Threshold Values**:
   - Given `n` is constrained between 2 and 5, the significant performance issues arise from overlapping ranges creating large subsets to evaluate, not the overall problem size. Thus, the focus is on how these ranges interact rather than the number of companies alone.

These invariants provide a broad understanding of the conditions under which the code may experience slowdowns based on range interactions and the resulting combinatorial evaluations. This information is crucial for testing and optimizing similar problems in the future.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
Nowadays, most of the internet advertisements are not statically linked to a web page. Instead, what will be shown to the person opening a web page is determined within 100 milliseconds after the web page is opened. Usually, multiple companies compete for each ad slot on the web page in an auction. Each of them receives a request with details about the user, web page and ad slot and they have to respond within those 100 milliseconds with a bid they would pay for putting an advertisement on that ad slot. The company that suggests the highest bid wins the auction and gets to place its advertisement. If there are several companies tied for the highest bid, the winner gets picked at random.

However, the company that won the auction does not have to pay the exact amount of its bid. In most of the cases, a second-price auction is used. This means that the amount paid by the company is equal to the maximum of all the other bids placed for this ad slot.

Let's consider one such bidding. There are n companies competing for placing an ad. The i-th of these companies will bid an integer number of microdollars equiprobably randomly chosen from the range between Li and Ri, inclusive. In the other words, the value of the i-th company bid can be any integer from the range [Li, Ri] with the same probability. 

Determine the expected value that the winner will have to pay in a second-price auction.

Input

The first line of input contains an integer number n (2 ≤ n ≤ 5). n lines follow, the i-th of them containing two numbers Li and Ri (1 ≤ Li ≤ Ri ≤ 10000) describing the i-th company's bid preferences.

This problem doesn't have subproblems. You will get 8 points for the correct submission.

Output

Output the answer with absolute or relative error no more than 1e - 9.

Examples

Input

3
4 7
8 10
5 5


Output

5.7500000000


Input

3
2 5
3 4
1 6


Output

3.5000000000

Note

Consider the first example. The first company bids a random integer number of microdollars in range [4, 7]; the second company bids between 8 and 10, and the third company bids 5 microdollars. The second company will win regardless of the exact value it bids, however the price it will pay depends on the value of first company's bid. With probability 0.5 the first company will bid at most 5 microdollars, and the second-highest price of the whole auction will be 5. With probability 0.25 it will bid 6 microdollars, and with probability 0.25 it will bid 7 microdollars. Thus, the expected value the second company will have to pay is 0.5·5 + 0.25·6 + 0.25·7 = 5.75.

Solution (C++ code):

assistant: ### Phase 3: Implement Performance-Characterizing Invariants in C++

Here are the C++ code snippets implementing the performance-checking conditions based on the natural language invariants derived previously:

```cpp
void check_combination_explosion(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck triggered by combination explosion!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_high_overlap(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck triggered by high overlap in bid ranges!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_large_range_sizes(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck triggered by large range sizes in competitive bids!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrate Checks into the Original C++ Program

Below is the instrumented C++ program with the performance checks inserted at appropriate points:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int n;
int l[5], r[5], val = 0;
double len[5], tot = 0;

// Performance-checking functions
void check_combination_explosion(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck triggered by combination explosion!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_high_overlap(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck triggered by high overlap in bid ranges!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_large_range_sizes(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck triggered by large range sizes in competitive bids!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main(void) {
    cin >> n;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        cin >> l[i] >> r[i];
        len[i] = (double)(r[i] - l[i] + 1);
        val = min(val, l[i]);
    }

    // Check for high overlap in bid ranges
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
            // Overlap if ranges intersect significantly
            check_high_overlap(max(l[i], l[j]) <= min(r[i], r[j]));
        }
    }

    for (int i = val; i <= 10000; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            if (r[j] >= i) {
                double p1 = 1, p2 = 1;
                for (int k = 0; k < n; k++) {
                    if (k != j) {
                        p1 *= max(0.0, (min(i, r[k]) - l[k] + 1) / len[k]);
                        p2 *= max(0.0, (min(i, r[k] + 1) - l[k]) / len[k]);
                    }
                }
                p1 -= p2;
                tot += i * p1 * ((r[j] - max(l[j] - 1, i)) / len[j]);
                if (l[j] <= i && p1 > 0) {
                    bool can[5];
                    vector<int> v;
                    for (int k = 0; k < n; k++) can[k] = false;
                    for (int k = 0; k < n; k++)
                        if (k != j) can[k] = (l[k] <= i && i <= r[k]);
                    for (int k = 0; k < n; k++)
                        if (can[k]) v.push_back(k);

                    // Check for combination explosion
                    check_combination_explosion(v.size() > 3); // Trigger if too many combinations

                    for (int k = 1; k < (1 << v.size()); k++) {
                        double e = 1, div = 0;
                        for (int l1 = 0; l1 < v.size(); l1++) {
                            if (k & (1 << l1)) {
                                e *= 1 / len[v[l1]];
                                div++;
                            } else {
                                e *= max(0.0, (min(i, r[v[l1]] + 1) - l[v[l1]]) / len[v[l1]]);
                            }
                        }
                        tot += 1 / (div + 1) * e * i * 1 / len[j];
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
   // Check for large range sizes
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        check_large_range_sizes(r[i] - l[i] > 8000); // Consider large range as potential bottleneck
    }

    printf("%.11f\n", tot);
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:

- **Checker Integration Points**:
  - **High Overlap Check**: Added after reading inputs to detect significant intersection between bid ranges.
  - **Combination Explosion Check**: Located before the loop over subsets to catch large subset evaluations.
  - **Large Range Sizes Check**: Placed after reading inputs to warn about wide bid ranges that could increase possibility space.

These checks will help in proactively identifying performance bottlenecks under specific conditions, aiding optimization and testing efforts.
