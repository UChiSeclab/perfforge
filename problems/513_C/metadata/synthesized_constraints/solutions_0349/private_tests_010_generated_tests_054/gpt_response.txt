### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Analyzing Line-level Hit Counts**:
   - **Significant Difference**: 
     - The line `for (int k = 1; k < (1 << v.size()); k++)` (line 33) shows a significant increase in hit count for the slow input (168,044 vs. 12,108).
     - Similarly, lines inside this loop, such as `double e = 1, div = 0;` (line 34), `if (k & (1 << l1))` (line 36), and `tot += 1 / (div + 1) * e * i * 1 / len[j];` (line 43) exhibit much higher hit counts for the slow input.

2. **Understanding the Code**:
   - **Nested Loops and Combinatorial Explosion**:
     - The nesting at line 33 involves iterating over subsets of a vector `v`. The size of `v` determines how many iterations occur, as it iterates over `2^v.size()` combinations.
   - **Conditions and Constraints**:
     - This loop becomes expensive particularly when `v.size()` increases, leading to a combinatorial explosion of the subset iteration.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **Performance Invariant Descriptions**:
   
   - **Invariant 1: Combination Explosion in Subset Evaluation**:
     - **Natural Language**: "If multiple companies have overlapping bid ranges that are large, the program may slow down significantly due to the exponential increase in subset combinations to evaluate."
     - **Explanation**: When bidders have ranges that lead to a large set `v`, the code evaluates a large number of combinations, causing slowdown.

   - **Invariant 2: High Overlap in Bid Ranges**:
     - **Natural Language**: "When multiple companies have bid ranges that heavily overlap, the program iterates through a large number of combinations, significantly increasing execution time."
     - **Explanation**: Overlapping bid ranges increase the number of combinations to consider, leading to more iterations in the nested loop.

   - **Invariant 3: Large Range Sizes in Competitive Bids**:
     - **Natural Language**: "The program's performance degrades when one or more companies have bid ranges that permit many potential maximum bids, especially when evaluated against others with similar ranges."
     - **Explanation**: If the bid ranges are large, especially when other companies have similar ranges, the possibility space of bids grows, increasing computational complexity.

2. **Threshold Values**:
   - Given `n` is constrained between 2 and 5, the significant performance issues arise from overlapping ranges creating large subsets to evaluate, not the overall problem size. Thus, the focus is on how these ranges interact rather than the number of companies alone.

These invariants provide a broad understanding of the conditions under which the code may experience slowdowns based on range interactions and the resulting combinatorial evaluations. This information is crucial for testing and optimizing similar problems in the future.

### Phase 3: Implement Performance-Characterizing Invariants in C++

Here are the C++ code snippets implementing the performance-checking conditions based on the natural language invariants derived previously:

```cpp
void check_combination_explosion(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck triggered by combination explosion!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_high_overlap(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck triggered by high overlap in bid ranges!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_large_range_sizes(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck triggered by large range sizes in competitive bids!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrate Checks into the Original C++ Program

Below is the instrumented C++ program with the performance checks inserted at appropriate points:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int n;
int l[5], r[5], val = 0;
double len[5], tot = 0;

// Performance-checking functions
void check_combination_explosion(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck triggered by combination explosion!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_high_overlap(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck triggered by high overlap in bid ranges!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_large_range_sizes(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck triggered by large range sizes in competitive bids!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main(void) {
    cin >> n;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        cin >> l[i] >> r[i];
        len[i] = (double)(r[i] - l[i] + 1);
        val = min(val, l[i]);
    }

    // Check for high overlap in bid ranges
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
            // Overlap if ranges intersect significantly
            check_high_overlap(max(l[i], l[j]) <= min(r[i], r[j]));
        }
    }

    for (int i = val; i <= 10000; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            if (r[j] >= i) {
                double p1 = 1, p2 = 1;
                for (int k = 0; k < n; k++) {
                    if (k != j) {
                        p1 *= max(0.0, (min(i, r[k]) - l[k] + 1) / len[k]);
                        p2 *= max(0.0, (min(i, r[k] + 1) - l[k]) / len[k]);
                    }
                }
                p1 -= p2;
                tot += i * p1 * ((r[j] - max(l[j] - 1, i)) / len[j]);
                if (l[j] <= i && p1 > 0) {
                    bool can[5];
                    vector<int> v;
                    for (int k = 0; k < n; k++) can[k] = false;
                    for (int k = 0; k < n; k++)
                        if (k != j) can[k] = (l[k] <= i && i <= r[k]);
                    for (int k = 0; k < n; k++)
                        if (can[k]) v.push_back(k);

                    // Check for combination explosion
                    check_combination_explosion(v.size() > 3); // Trigger if too many combinations

                    for (int k = 1; k < (1 << v.size()); k++) {
                        double e = 1, div = 0;
                        for (int l1 = 0; l1 < v.size(); l1++) {
                            if (k & (1 << l1)) {
                                e *= 1 / len[v[l1]];
                                div++;
                            } else {
                                e *= max(0.0, (min(i, r[v[l1]] + 1) - l[v[l1]]) / len[v[l1]]);
                            }
                        }
                        tot += 1 / (div + 1) * e * i * 1 / len[j];
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
   // Check for large range sizes
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        check_large_range_sizes(r[i] - l[i] > 8000); // Consider large range as potential bottleneck
    }

    printf("%.11f\n", tot);
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:

- **Checker Integration Points**:
  - **High Overlap Check**: Added after reading inputs to detect significant intersection between bid ranges.
  - **Combination Explosion Check**: Located before the loop over subsets to catch large subset evaluations.
  - **Large Range Sizes Check**: Placed after reading inputs to warn about wide bid ranges that could increase possibility space.

These checks will help in proactively identifying performance bottlenecks under specific conditions, aiding optimization and testing efforts.
