system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

Nowadays, most of the internet advertisements are not statically linked to a web page. Instead, what will be shown to the person opening a web page is determined within 100 milliseconds after the web page is opened. Usually, multiple companies compete for each ad slot on the web page in an auction. Each of them receives a request with details about the user, web page and ad slot and they have to respond within those 100 milliseconds with a bid they would pay for putting an advertisement on that ad slot. The company that suggests the highest bid wins the auction and gets to place its advertisement. If there are several companies tied for the highest bid, the winner gets picked at random.

However, the company that won the auction does not have to pay the exact amount of its bid. In most of the cases, a second-price auction is used. This means that the amount paid by the company is equal to the maximum of all the other bids placed for this ad slot.

Let's consider one such bidding. There are n companies competing for placing an ad. The i-th of these companies will bid an integer number of microdollars equiprobably randomly chosen from the range between Li and Ri, inclusive. In the other words, the value of the i-th company bid can be any integer from the range [Li, Ri] with the same probability. 

Determine the expected value that the winner will have to pay in a second-price auction.

Input

The first line of input contains an integer number n (2 ≤ n ≤ 5). n lines follow, the i-th of them containing two numbers Li and Ri (1 ≤ Li ≤ Ri ≤ 10000) describing the i-th company's bid preferences.

This problem doesn't have subproblems. You will get 8 points for the correct submission.

Output

Output the answer with absolute or relative error no more than 1e - 9.

Examples

Input

3
4 7
8 10
5 5


Output

5.7500000000


Input

3
2 5
3 4
1 6


Output

3.5000000000

Note

Consider the first example. The first company bids a random integer number of microdollars in range [4, 7]; the second company bids between 8 and 10, and the third company bids 5 microdollars. The second company will win regardless of the exact value it bids, however the price it will pay depends on the value of first company's bid. With probability 0.5 the first company will bid at most 5 microdollars, and the second-highest price of the whole auction will be 5. With probability 0.25 it will bid 6 microdollars, and with probability 0.25 it will bid 7 microdollars. Thus, the expected value the second company will have to pay is 0.5·5 + 0.25·6 + 0.25·7 = 5.75.

assistant: ### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

Upon analyzing the hit counts, we notice a significant difference in execution frequency between the "slow" and "fast" inputs:

1. **Function `glen`** (lines 21-37): 
   - This function is called far more often with the slow input than with the fast input. For example, line 21 is hit 6,985,593 times in the slow input compared to 1,462,945 times in the fast input.
   - Lines 26, 29, and 33 exhibit similar patterns, indicating multiple recursive calls and branching within the function.
   - The recursive calls increase significantly in count, suggesting that a specific condition is leading to deeper or more frequent recursion.

2. **Function `dzen`** (lines 8-20):
   - This function also shows increased hit counts. Line 8 is hit 1,003,885 times for the slow input vs. 351,561 times for the fast input.
   - The difference is particularly noticeable at line 16 and line 17, suggesting that the branching condition at line 16 (`if (l[x] < i)`) is frequently satisfied, resulting in more recursive calls.

3. **Loop in Main Function** (lines 45-49):
   - The loop iterating over `i` from 1 to 10,000 is constant in both inputs but affects how the `dzen` and `glen` functions are invoked. The recursion and branching within these functions seem to be the main contributors to the performance difference.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-characterizing Invariants

Based on the observations, we can derive the following performance-characterizing invariants:

1. **Invariant on Range Sizes**: 
   - When the ranges `[Li, Ri]` for multiple companies are large, the recursion depth and frequency of calls in functions like `glen` and `dzen` increase. This is especially true when multiple companies have overlapping ranges near the maximum bid values (close to 10,000), leading to more recursive evaluations and comparisons.
   - **Natural language statement**: "If the bidding ranges for multiple companies overlap significantly and extend near the maximum bid value, the program may perform excessive recursive calculations."

2. **Invariant on Bid Range Overlaps**:
   - If a company's bid range `[Li, Ri]` overlaps with several others at critical points (such as near the high end of their ranges), the program evaluates more potential winning and second-highest bids, increasing the computation time.
   - **Natural language statement**: "When multiple bid ranges overlap at high values, the program's recursive functions are likely to engage in multiple, redundant computations of potential outcomes, slowing the execution."

3. **Invariant on Recursive Depth and Branching**:
   - The performance can degrade when a recursive call processes a high branching factor, particularly with the recursive functions designed to evaluate bid scenarios (`glen` and `dzen`).
   - **Natural language statement**: "If the recursive functions consistently encounter high branching factors due to similar bid ranges, they may execute more paths than necessary, leading to increased computation times."

These invariants are abstract representations of conditions that lead to slow execution paths and can serve as guidelines for understanding potential performance issues in future inputs.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
Nowadays, most of the internet advertisements are not statically linked to a web page. Instead, what will be shown to the person opening a web page is determined within 100 milliseconds after the web page is opened. Usually, multiple companies compete for each ad slot on the web page in an auction. Each of them receives a request with details about the user, web page and ad slot and they have to respond within those 100 milliseconds with a bid they would pay for putting an advertisement on that ad slot. The company that suggests the highest bid wins the auction and gets to place its advertisement. If there are several companies tied for the highest bid, the winner gets picked at random.

However, the company that won the auction does not have to pay the exact amount of its bid. In most of the cases, a second-price auction is used. This means that the amount paid by the company is equal to the maximum of all the other bids placed for this ad slot.

Let's consider one such bidding. There are n companies competing for placing an ad. The i-th of these companies will bid an integer number of microdollars equiprobably randomly chosen from the range between Li and Ri, inclusive. In the other words, the value of the i-th company bid can be any integer from the range [Li, Ri] with the same probability. 

Determine the expected value that the winner will have to pay in a second-price auction.

Input

The first line of input contains an integer number n (2 ≤ n ≤ 5). n lines follow, the i-th of them containing two numbers Li and Ri (1 ≤ Li ≤ Ri ≤ 10000) describing the i-th company's bid preferences.

This problem doesn't have subproblems. You will get 8 points for the correct submission.

Output

Output the answer with absolute or relative error no more than 1e - 9.

Examples

Input

3
4 7
8 10
5 5


Output

5.7500000000


Input

3
2 5
3 4
1 6


Output

3.5000000000

Note

Consider the first example. The first company bids a random integer number of microdollars in range [4, 7]; the second company bids between 8 and 10, and the third company bids 5 microdollars. The second company will win regardless of the exact value it bids, however the price it will pay depends on the value of first company's bid. With probability 0.5 the first company will bid at most 5 microdollars, and the second-highest price of the whole auction will be 5. With probability 0.25 it will bid 6 microdollars, and with probability 0.25 it will bid 7 microdollars. Thus, the expected value the second company will have to pay is 0.5·5 + 0.25·6 + 0.25·7 = 5.75.

assistant: ### Phase 3: Implement the Natural Language Invariants as C++ Code

Based on the performance-characterizing invariants derived earlier, we will implement C++ code to check these conditions at runtime:

1. **Invariant on Range Sizes**
   - We will check if multiple companies have overlapping ranges close to the maximum bid value.

```cpp
void check_range_overlap_invariant(int n, int l[], int r[]) {
    int overlapCount = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        if (r[i] > 9000) {  // Consider ranges that extend high near max value
            overlapCount++;
        }
    }
    if (overlapCount > 1) {  // More than one company has a high overlapping range
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to high overlapping bid ranges!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

2. **Invariant on Recursive Depth and Branching**
   - We will check for conditions that induce high branching due to overlapping bid ranges.

```cpp
void check_high_branching_invariant(int n, int l[], int r[]) {
    int branchingFactor = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j <= n; ++j) {
            if ((l[i] <= r[j] && r[i] >= l[j]) || (l[j] <= r[i] && r[j] >= l[i])) {
                branchingFactor++;
            }
        }
    }
    if (branchingFactor > 2) {  // High branching due to overlapping bid ranges
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to high recursion branching factor!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrate the Checkers Into the Original C++ Code

Now, let's integrate these runtime checks into the provided C++ program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
const int inf = (int)1e9, maxn = (int)1e5 + 1;
const double eps = (double)1e-8;
const int mod = (int)1000000009;
int i, n, l[10], r[10];
double s, v, ans;

// Check for high overlapping bid ranges
void check_range_overlap_invariant(int n, int l[], int r[]) {
    int overlapCount = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        if (r[i] > 9000) {  // Consider ranges that extend high near max value
            overlapCount++;
        }
    }
    if (overlapCount > 1) {  // More than one company has a high overlapping range
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to high overlapping bid ranges!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Check for high branching due to overlapping bid ranges
void check_high_branching_invariant(int n, int l[], int r[]) {
    int branchingFactor = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j <= n; ++j) {
            if ((l[i] <= r[j] && r[i] >= l[j]) || (l[j] <= r[i] && r[j] >= l[i])) {
                branchingFactor++;
            }
        }
    }
    if (branchingFactor > 2) {  // High branching due to overlapping bid ranges
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to high recursion branching factor!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void dzen(double tv, int x, int t) {
    if (x == n + 1 && t >= 2) {
        v += tv;
        return;
    }
    if (l[x] <= i && r[x] >= i) {
        dzen(tv / double(r[x] - l[x] + 1), x + 1, t + 1);
    }
    if (l[x] < i) {
        dzen(tv * (double(min(r[x] + 1, i) - l[x]) / (r[x] - l[x] + 1)), x + 1, t);
    }
    return;
}

void glen(double tv, int x, int t1, int t2) {
    if (x == n + 1 && t1 == 1 && t2 == 1) {
        v += tv;
        return;
    }
    if (l[x] <= i && r[x] >= i) {
        glen(tv / double(r[x] - l[x] + 1), x + 1, 1, t2);
    }
    if (l[x] < i) {
        glen(tv * (double(min(r[x] + 1, i) - l[x] + 1)), x + 1, t1, t2);
    }
    if (r[x] > i && t2 == 0) {
        glen(tv * (double(r[x] - max(l[x] - 1, i)) / (r[x] - l[x] + 1)), x + 1, t1, 1);
    }
    return;
}

int main() {
    cout << fixed << setprecision(10);
    cin >> n;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        cin >> l[i] >> r[i];
    }

    // Perform invariant checks after reading inputs
    check_range_overlap_invariant(n, l, r);
    check_high_branching_invariant(n, l, r);

    for (i = 1; i <= 10000; i++) {
        v = 0;
        dzen(1, 1, 0);
        glen(1, 1, 0, 0);
        ans += v * i;
    }
    cout << ans;
    return 0;
}
```

**Comments**:
- **Checkers are placed after reading inputs**: This ensures that potential bottlenecks are detected early without adding overhead in the main computation loops.
- **Avoids redundant warnings**: Each check is designed to detect different but related conditions that could lead to performance issues.
