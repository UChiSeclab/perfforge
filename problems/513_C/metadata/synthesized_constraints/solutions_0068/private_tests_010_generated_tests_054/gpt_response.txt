=== Invariants Response ===
To analyze the performance bottleneck in the given C code and generate performance-characterizing invariants, we need to delve into the hit count data and the problem logic. Here's a structured approach to deriving the required information:

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Compare Line-Level Hit Counts:**
   - Focus on the function `func(int pos, int eNum, int bNum)`. This function is the core recursive function that evaluates different bid scenarios and contributes to the expected value calculation.
   - Line 56 (`func` function entry) has a significantly higher hit count in the slow input (680,597 hits) compared to the fast input (288,805 hits).
   - Other lines within the `func` function also exhibit higher hit counts for the slow input, such as lines 57, 58, 59, 60, and 63.

2. **Pinpoint Trouble Areas:**
   - The recursive calls within `func` (lines 69, 77, 85) are contributing to the high hit count. The increased recursion depth and branching are likely causes for the slowdown.
   - The calculations involving `curnum` and the range checks (lines 67 and 80) seem to be consistently processed, indicating broader ranges or more complex scenarios for the slow input.

3. **Interaction with Data Structures:**
   - The recursion explores all possible bid values between the given ranges `[Li, Ri]` for each company, which impacts the depth and breadth of the recursion tree.
   - The `memset` on the `vis` array (line 106) is called often, suggesting persistent state checks across multiple recursive paths.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the above analysis, the following performance characterizations can be made:

1. **High Dimensionality of Range Space:**
   - Natural Language Invariant: "When the range of bids for any company is large, the recursive function explores a vast number of possible bid combinations, leading to significant performance degradation."
   - Reasoning: Larger ranges increase the number of possible bid values, resulting in deeper and more complex recursion trees.

2. **Frequent State Re-computation:**
   - Natural Language Invariant: "When overlapping bid ranges occur frequently across companies, the algorithm tends to recompute similar states, resulting in inefficient processing."
   - Reasoning: The `memset` and recursion cache (`vis`) indicate repeated recomputation due to overlapping bid ranges.

3. **Recursive Call Depth and Branching:**
   - Natural Language Invariant: "If the recursive branching factor is high, or the depth of recursion increases due to many companies having overlapping bid ranges, the program becomes slow."
   - Reasoning: Both branching and recursion depth increase with the complexity of bid overlaps, which are exacerbated by larger or similar ranges.

4. **Limited Caching Efficiency:**
   - Natural Language Invariant: "When bid ranges are not distinct enough, the caching mechanism fails to prevent redundant calculations, leading to performance issues."
   - Reasoning: The `vis` array caches states, but if ranges are overlapping or too broad, the cache hit rate decreases, resulting in redundant calculations.

### Final Thoughts

The slow performance primarily arises from the recursive exploration of bid possibilities that spans a large combinatorial space, especially when bid ranges are extensive or overlapping. The derived performance invariants are abstract enough to apply broadly within the problem's constraints but provide specific insights into likely slow-execution conditions.

=== Checker Response ===
Let's proceed to implement the runtime checks for the performance-characterizing invariants in C++.

### Phase 3: Implementing Checks for Performance-Characterizing Invariants

We'll translate the natural language invariants into C++ checker code.

1. **Invariant 1 - High Dimensionality of Range Space:**
   - Natural Language: "When the range of bids for any company is large, the recursive function explores a vast number of possibilities, leading to significant performance degradation."
   - C++ Code:

```cpp
void check_range_invariant(int l[], int r[], int n) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        if ((r[i] - l[i]) > 5000) { // Arbitrary threshold for large range
            cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to large bid range!" << endl;
            abort();
        }
    }
}
```

2. **Invariant 2 - Frequent State Re-computation:**
   - Natural Language: "When overlapping bid ranges occur frequently across companies, the algorithm tends to recompute similar states, leading to inefficient processing."
   - C++ Code:

```cpp
void check_overlap_invariant(int l[], int r[], int n) {
    int total_overlap = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j < n; ++j) {
            if (max(l[i], l[j]) <= min(r[i], r[j])) {
                total_overlap++;
            }
        }
    }
    if (total_overlap > 10) { // Arbitrary threshold for excessive overlap
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to overlapping bid ranges!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

3. **Invariant 3 - Recursive Call Depth and Branching:**
   - Natural Language: "If the recursive branching factor is high, or the depth of recursion increases due to many companies having overlapping bid ranges, the program becomes slow."
   - C++ Code:

```cpp
void check_recursive_invariant(int n) {
    if (n > 4) { // Since n can be at most 5, check if it's at the upper limit
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to high branching factor!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrate Checkers into the Original Program

Now, we integrate these checks into the original C++ program.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
const double PI = acos(-1);
const double eps = 1e-9;
const int inf = 2000000000;
const long long infLL = 9000000000000000000;

// Function prototypes for checks
void check_range_invariant(int l[], int r[], int n);
void check_overlap_invariant(int l[], int r[], int n);
void check_recursive_invariant(int n);

const int MX = 10100;
int vis[5][5][5], l[5], r[5], curnum, n;
double dp[5][5][5];

double func(int pos, int eNum, int bNum) {
    if (bNum > 1) return 0;
    if (pos == n) {
        if (eNum > 1 && !bNum) return 1;
        if (eNum && bNum) return 1;
        return 0;
    }
    if (vis[pos][eNum][bNum]) return dp[pos][eNum][bNum];
    vis[pos][eNum][bNum] = 0;
    double &ret = dp[pos][eNum][bNum];
    ret = 0;
    if (curnum >= l[pos] && curnum <= r[pos]) {
        double temp = (1.0 / (r[pos] - l[pos] + 1));
        temp *= func(pos + 1, eNum + 1, bNum);
        ret += temp;
    }
    if (r[pos] > curnum) {
        double temp = 1;
        if (l[pos] <= curnum) {
            temp *= (double)(r[pos] - curnum) / (double)(r[pos] - l[pos] + 1);
        }
        temp *= func(pos + 1, eNum, bNum + 1);
        ret += temp;
    }
    if (l[pos] < curnum) {
        double temp = 1;
        if (r[pos] >= curnum) {
            temp *= (double)(curnum - l[pos]) / (double)(r[pos] - l[pos] + 1);
        }
        temp *= func(pos + 1, eNum, bNum);
        ret += temp;
    }
    return ret;
}

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
    cin.tie(0);
    cout.tie(0);

    cout.unsetf(ios::floatfield);
    cout.precision(10);
    cout.setf(ios::fixed, ios::floatfield);

    cin >> n;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) cin >> l[i] >> r[i];

    // Insert checks before processing
    check_range_invariant(l, r, n); // Check for large bid ranges
    check_overlap_invariant(l, r, n); // Check for overlapping bid ranges
    check_recursive_invariant(n); // Check for high branching factor

    double ans = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i < MX; ++i) {
        curnum = i;
        ans += i * func(0, 0, 0);
        memset(vis, 0, sizeof(vis));
    }

    cout << ans;
    return 0;
}

// Function definitions for checks
void check_range_invariant(int l[], int r[], int n) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        if ((r[i] - l[i]) > 5000) { // Arbitrary threshold for large range
            cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to large bid range!" << endl;
            abort();
        }
    }
}

void check_overlap_invariant(int l[], int r[], int n) {
    int total_overlap = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j < n; ++j) {
            if (max(l[i], l[j]) <= min(r[i], r[j])) {
                total_overlap++;
            }
        }
    }
    if (total_overlap > 10) { // Arbitrary threshold for excessive overlap
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to overlapping bid ranges!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_recursive_invariant(int n) {
    if (n > 4) { // Since n can be at most 5, check if it's at the upper limit
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to high branching factor!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Check Insertion:** The checks are inserted in the `main` function after reading the input values. This ensures that any problematic input patterns are caught early, before any computation begins.
2. **Avoiding Overhead:** The checks are placed outside the main computation loop to avoid any additional overhead during recursive computations.

The above code integrates the performance checks effectively, ensuring that potential bottlenecks are flagged during execution.
