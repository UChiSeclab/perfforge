system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

Igor has fallen in love with Tanya. Now Igor wants to show his feelings and write a number on the fence opposite to Tanya's house. Igor thinks that the larger the number is, the more chance to win Tanya's heart he has. 

Unfortunately, Igor could only get v liters of paint. He did the math and concluded that digit d requires ad liters of paint. Besides, Igor heard that Tanya doesn't like zeroes. That's why Igor won't use them in his number.

Help Igor find the maximum number he can write on the fence.

Input

The first line contains a positive integer v (0 ≤ v ≤ 106). The second line contains nine positive integers a1, a2, ..., a9 (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).

Output

Print the maximum number Igor can write on the fence. If he has too little paint for any digit (so, he cannot write anything), print -1.

assistant: To analyze the performance bottleneck for the provided C program, let’s break down the problem and the differences in execution between the fast and slow inputs. Our goal is to identify the critical points where the program differs in execution patterns and then formalize these findings into natural language performance invariants.

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Line-Level Hit Count Analysis:**

   - The `f(int v)` function, particularly its recursive nature, has a significantly higher hit count for the slow input compared to the fast input. Specifically, lines 10 to 23 show a noticeable difference in the number of times they are executed.
   - The recursive calls on line 16 (`r = f(v - a[i]);`) get excessive, suggesting that this loop explores many combinations or repeatedly recalculates results.
   - The `for` loop on line 15 and the recursive function calls are the main contributors to the increase in execution time because they are hit more than four times as often for the slow input compared to the fast input.

2. **Interaction with Data Structures and Recursion:**

   - The recursion within the `f` function tries to determine the maximum number that can be formed with the available paint. It appears to explore many paths due to the recursive calls for each digit choice from 9 to 1.
   - The dynamic programming table `dp` is used to store previously computed results, but due to the setup, the cache might not be utilized as efficiently for the slow input. The cache misses or recalculations might be higher in this case.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on our analysis, we can derive several conditions that may lead to performance slowdowns:

1. **Invariant 1: High Variation in Paint Costs Across Digits**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "When there is a high variation in the amount of paint needed across different digits, the algorithm may explore more combinations, leading to a slowdown. This is because the recursive function makes more calls to explore less efficient paths."
   - **Explanation:** In the slow input, the cost of the second digit (4) is much lower than the other digits, causing the algorithm to often select this digit and recurse further.

2. **Invariant 2: Inefficient Caching due to High Recursive Branching**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "If recursive branching is high due to a small subset of digits having significantly lower paint costs, performance can degrade as many recursive paths are explored, leading to excessive recalculation despite dynamic programming."
   - **Explanation:** The dynamic programming cache might not be effectively utilized if the program recalculates similar states frequently due to varying paint costs.

3. **Invariant 3: Large Value of `v` with Lower Individual Costs**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "When the total paint available (`v`) is large, and individual digits have a very low paint cost, the recursion depth and breadth can increase drastically, resulting in a slowdown."
   - **Explanation:** With high `v` and low paint values for certain digits, the algorithm explores a larger search space, increasing hit counts for recursive calls.

These invariants help characterize the conditions under which the C program's performance degrades, focusing on recursive branching, caching efficiency, and the paint cost structure relative to the available total paint `v`.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
Igor has fallen in love with Tanya. Now Igor wants to show his feelings and write a number on the fence opposite to Tanya's house. Igor thinks that the larger the number is, the more chance to win Tanya's heart he has. 

Unfortunately, Igor could only get v liters of paint. He did the math and concluded that digit d requires ad liters of paint. Besides, Igor heard that Tanya doesn't like zeroes. That's why Igor won't use them in his number.

Help Igor find the maximum number he can write on the fence.

Input

The first line contains a positive integer v (0 ≤ v ≤ 106). The second line contains nine positive integers a1, a2, ..., a9 (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).

Output

Print the maximum number Igor can write on the fence. If he has too little paint for any digit (so, he cannot write anything), print -1.

assistant: ### Phase 3: Implement Performance-Characterizing Invariants in C++

Based on the natural language invariants derived earlier, here are the C++ code snippets that implement the checks for the conditions under which the program might slow down. These checks do not rely on specific input values and abstract the conditions into broader categories or thresholds.

1. **Invariant 1: High Variation in Paint Costs Across Digits**

```cpp
void check_paint_cost_variation(const vector<int>& costs) {
    int maxCost = *max_element(costs.begin(), costs.end());
    int minCost = *min_element(costs.begin(), costs.end());
    if (maxCost > 2 * minCost) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck triggered by high paint cost variation!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

2. **Invariant 2: Inefficient Caching due to High Recursive Branching**

```cpp
void check_recursive_branching(int depth, int branchFactor) {
    if (depth > 50 && branchFactor > 5) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to high recursion depth and branching!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

3. **Invariant 3: Large Value of `v` with Lower Individual Costs**

```cpp
void check_large_v_low_costs(int v, const vector<int>& costs) {
    int minCost = *min_element(costs.begin(), costs.end());
    if (v > 500000 && minCost < 10) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to large v and low individual costs!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrate Checker Code into the Original C++ Program

Now, I'll integrate these checks into the original program, ensuring they are placed at effective points in the code to avoid unnecessary overhead.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int a[10];
int dp[1000100][2];

void path(int v, int l) {
    if (v <= 0 || l == 0) return;
    cout << dp[v][1];
    path(v - a[dp[v][1]], l - 1);
}

int f(int v) {
    if (v < 0) return -1;
    if (dp[v][0] != -1) return dp[v][0];
    int res = -10;
    int r, d = 0;
    for (int i = 9; i >= 1; i--) {
        r = f(v - a[i]);
        if (r > res) {
            res = r;
            d = i;
        }
    }
    dp[v][1] = d;
    return dp[v][0] = res + 1;
}

// Check for high paint cost variation.
void check_paint_cost_variation(const vector<int>& costs) {
    int maxCost = *max_element(costs.begin(), costs.end());
    int minCost = *min_element(costs.begin(), costs.end());
    if (maxCost > 2 * minCost) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck triggered by high paint cost variation!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Check for large v with low individual costs.

### Explanation

- **High Paint Cost Variation Check:** This check is placed after reading the input costs. It warns if there is a significant disparity between the maximum and minimum paint costs.
- **Large `v` with Low Individual Costs Check:** This check is inserted after the input reading to detect conditions where `v` is large, but individual costs allow for excessive recursion.

These checks help identify conditions where the program might experience performance bottlenecks, allowing for early termination and identification of problematic input scenarios.
