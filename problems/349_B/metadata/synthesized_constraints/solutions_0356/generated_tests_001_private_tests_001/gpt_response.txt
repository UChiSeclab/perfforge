=== Invariants Response ===
Based on the hit count information and the input problem, let's analyze the code to derive performance-characterizing invariants.

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Function `rec(int l)`**:
   - The hit count for function `rec` is significantly higher on the slow input (`121,105` hits) compared to the fast input (`29,118` hits).
   - The loop inside `rec` (lines 19-23) iterates over the nine available digits and checks whether the remaining paint is sufficient to use a digit. The recursive call `rec(l - arr[i])` takes place if a digit can be used.
   - Due to high hit counts in the loop and recursion, it seems that the function explores many combinations of digits, leading to a high number of recursive calls.

2. **Line `while (dp[l][1] != -1)` in Function `build(int l)`**:
   - This line is responsible for reconstructing the solution. It also has a higher hit count on the slow input (20 hits) compared to the fast input (10 hits).

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **Recursive Exploration and Digit Combinations**:
   - **Invariant**: "When the paint costs of digits are close to each other, particularly where the cheapest digit is not significantly cheaper than others, the recursive exploration in `rec` becomes extensive, leading to performance degradation. This is because multiple digits are viable at similar costs, resulting in numerous combinations to explore."
   
2. **Reconstruction of the Solution**:
   - **Invariant**: "If the number of digits with close paint costs leads to a large number of maximum-length combinations, the `build` function may need to iterate through more steps to output the result, slowing down performance."

### Explanation of Conditions

- The primary performance issue arises from the recursive `rec` function's behavior when digit paint costs are closely packed. The function attempts to maximize the number of digits by exploring various combinations recursively. If several digits have similar costs, especially when the cheapest digit is not distinctively cheaper, it results in a high branching factor, causing many recursive calls.
  
- Additionally, the `build` function's slowdown is a result of the large number of maximal-length numbers, which it needs to reconstruct and output. The solution reconstruction becomes performance-intensive if multiple equally good options exist due to the similar costs of the digits.

These invariants focus on the general structure of the problem and potential input scenarios rather than relying on exact numeric values from the slow input. They aim to capture situations that can cause slowdowns due to characteristics of the input data rather than just the input size.

=== Checker Response ===
Let's proceed with Phase 3, where we will implement the natural language invariants derived earlier into checker code in C++.

### Phase 3: Implement Natural Language Invariants in C++

1. **Invariant: Recursive Exploration and Digit Combinations**

   The bottleneck here is the recursive exploration when digit paint costs are close. We'll check if the minimum cost is not significantly lower than other costs, potentially leading to multiple viable combinations and a high branching factor in recursion.

   ```cpp
   void check_recursion_invariant(int* costs, int size) {
       int minCost = *std::min_element(costs, costs + size);
       int closeCosts = 0;
       for (int i = 0; i < size; ++i) {
           if (costs[i] <= minCost + 10) { // Arbitrary threshold for close costs
               closeCosts++;
           }
       }
       if (closeCosts > 3) { // More than 3 digits with close paint costs
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - "
                   "high branching factor due to similar digit costs!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Invariant: Reconstruction of the Solution**

   The bottleneck occurs when reconstructing many maximum-length numbers. We'll check if the maximum length of the number is particularly high.

   ```cpp
   void check_reconstruction_invariant(int maxLength) {
       if (maxLength > 50) { // Arbitrary threshold for a long number
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - "
                   "reconstruction of a very long number!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Integrate Checkers into the Original Program

Now, let's place these checks effectively in the C++ code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
const int N = 1e6 + 2;
int dp[N][2];
int arr[10];

// Checkers for performance bottlenecks

// Checks if the recursion may lead to a high branching factor
void check_recursion_invariant(int* costs, int size) {
    int minCost = *std::min_element(costs, costs + size);
    int closeCosts = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < size; ++i) {
        if (costs[i] <= minCost + 10) { // Arbitrary threshold for close costs
            closeCosts++;
        }
    }
    if (closeCosts > 3) { // More than 3 digits with close paint costs
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - "
                "high branching factor due to similar digit costs!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Checks if the reconstruction might lead to performance issues
void check_reconstruction_invariant(int maxLength) {
    if (maxLength > 50) { // Arbitrary threshold for a long number
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - "
                "reconstruction of a very long number!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void build(int l) {
    if (dp[l][1] == -1) {
        cout << -1 << endl;
        return;
    }
    int maxLength = 0;
    while (dp[l][1] != -1) {
        cout << dp[l][1] + 1;
        l -= arr[dp[l][1]];
        maxLength++;
    }
    check_reconstruction_invariant(maxLength); // Check during reconstruction
}

int rec(int l) {
    if (dp[l][0] != -1) return dp[l][0];
    for (int i = 8; i >= 0; i--) {
        if (l >= arr[i]) {
            int k = rec(l - arr[i]) + 1;
            if (k > dp[l][0]) dp[l][0] = k, dp[l][1] = i;
        }
    }
    if (dp[l][0] == -1) return 0;
    return dp[l][0];
}

int main() {
    int l;
    cin >> l;
    memset(dp, -1, sizeof dp);
    for (int i = 0; i < 9; i++) cin >> arr[i];
    
    check_recursion_invariant(arr, 9); // Check after reading costs
    
    rec(l), build(l);
}
```

### Explanation of Checker Placement

- **`check_recursion_invariant`** is called after reading the paint costs to assess if the recursive function might struggle with branching due to similar costs.

- **`check_reconstruction_invariant`** is called during the `build` process to ensure that the program doesn't attempt to output an excessively long number, which could indicate inefficiencies in reconstruction.

These checks act as early warnings for potential performance bottlenecks, aligning with our initial invariants while being careful not to introduce additional overhead in performance-critical sections.
