system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

Igor has fallen in love with Tanya. Now Igor wants to show his feelings and write a number on the fence opposite to Tanya's house. Igor thinks that the larger the number is, the more chance to win Tanya's heart he has. 

Unfortunately, Igor could only get v liters of paint. He did the math and concluded that digit d requires ad liters of paint. Besides, Igor heard that Tanya doesn't like zeroes. That's why Igor won't use them in his number.

Help Igor find the maximum number he can write on the fence.

Input

The first line contains a positive integer v (0 ≤ v ≤ 106). The second line contains nine positive integers a1, a2, ..., a9 (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).

Output

Print the maximum number Igor can write on the fence. If he has too little paint for any digit (so, he cannot write anything), print -1.

assistant: To analyze the performance bottlenecks in the given C program, let's break down the tasks into the two phases as described.

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Compare Line-Level Hit Counts:**
   - The function `f(x)` is a recursive function used extensively, with the hit count for the slow input significantly higher than for the fast input. Specifically, lines inside this function (lines 5 to 17) are hit much more frequently with the slow input.
   - The key line that stands out is line 9, which contains a loop iterating over the digits from 9 to 1. This loop is executed a lot more times in the slow input (425,790 hits versus 124,710 hits for the fast input).
   - Recursive calls on line 11 are made 121,104 times for the slow input as opposed to 29,117 times for the fast input.

2. **Pinpoint Problematic Areas:**
   - The recursive calls in line 11 are a significant contributor to the performance difference. This indicates that the recursion depth or branching factor in these recursive calls is larger for the slow input.
   - The condition in line 8 (`if (dp[x]) return dp[x];`) shows that many values of `x` are not memoized early, causing excessive recursive calls.

3. **Interaction with Data Structures:**
   - The function `f(x)` uses two arrays `dp` and `w` for memoization and digit tracking, respectively. The inefficient use of memoization (i.e., not caching results early enough) likely causes the recursive calls to multiply unnecessarily.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the analysis in Phase 1, we can derive the following performance-characterizing invariants:

1. **Invariant 1: Recursion Depth and Branching Factor**
   - Natural Language: "If the recursion explores many branches due to multiple valid digits fitting into the paint budget `v` at each step, the function's computation time increases significantly."
   - Explanation: The function tries each possible digit from largest to smallest, causing extensive exploration of combinations when multiple digits are feasible given the remaining paint. This can lead to a high branching factor if many digits have similar paint costs.

2. **Invariant 2: Insufficient Memoization**
   - Natural Language: "If there is insufficient caching of results (i.e., the `dp` array is not effectively utilized), the recursion will redundantly recompute values, leading to performance degradation."
   - Explanation: When the memoization array `dp` does not cover many states early, the program may repeatedly recompute results for the same input values, causing unnecessary recursive calls.

3. **Invariant 3: Large Remaining Paint Budget with Close Costs**
   - Natural Language: "If the remaining paint budget `v` is large and the paint costs for different digits are very close, the recursion will explore a vast number of possibilities, slowing down execution."
   - Explanation: When paint costs are close, particularly for higher digits, the recursive function will continue checking many possible combinations rather than quickly converging on an optimal solution.

These invariants abstractly capture the conditions that can lead to performance issues in the program without relying on specific numeric values from the input. They focus on the structural aspects of the code that contribute to inefficiency, such as recursion depth, memoization strategy, and the relative cost of options being processed.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
Igor has fallen in love with Tanya. Now Igor wants to show his feelings and write a number on the fence opposite to Tanya's house. Igor thinks that the larger the number is, the more chance to win Tanya's heart he has. 

Unfortunately, Igor could only get v liters of paint. He did the math and concluded that digit d requires ad liters of paint. Besides, Igor heard that Tanya doesn't like zeroes. That's why Igor won't use them in his number.

Help Igor find the maximum number he can write on the fence.

Input

The first line contains a positive integer v (0 ≤ v ≤ 106). The second line contains nine positive integers a1, a2, ..., a9 (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).

Output

Print the maximum number Igor can write on the fence. If he has too little paint for any digit (so, he cannot write anything), print -1.

assistant: Phase 3: Implement Checker Code for Performance Characterizing Invariants

Based on the performance-characterizing invariants derived in Phase 2, I will write C++ code snippets to check these conditions at runtime.

### Invariant 1: Recursion Depth and Branching Factor

```cpp
void check_recursion_invariant(int branchCount) {
    if (branchCount > 8) { // Assuming a high branching factor when nearly all digits are possible.
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high branching factor in recursion!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Invariant 2: Insufficient Memoization

```cpp
void check_memoization_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - insufficient memoization!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Invariant 3: Large Remaining Paint Budget with Close Costs

```cpp
void check_paint_budget_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large remaining paint budget with close costs!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

Phase 4: Integrate Checks into the Original Program

Now, I will integrate these checks into the original C++ program, ensuring they're placed effectively without adding overhead in tight loops.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Checker for recursion depth and branching factor
void check_recursion_invariant(int branchCount) {
    if (branchCount > 8) { // High branching factor assumption
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high branching factor in recursion!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Checker for insufficient memoization
void check_memoization_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - insufficient memoization!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Checker for large remaining paint budget with close costs
void check_paint_budget_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large remaining paint budget with close costs!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int i, j, k, t, n, m, a[15];
int dp[1000005], w[1000005];

int f(int x) {
    int ans = -1, t = 0;
    if (x == 0) return 0;
    if (dp[x]) return dp[x];

    int branchCount = 0; // To track the number of branching options in recursion

    for (int i = 9; i >= 1; i--) {
        if (x - a[i] < 0) continue;
        branchCount++;
        t = f(x - a[i]);
        if (t > ans) {
            ans = t;
            w[x] = i;
        }
    }

    check_recursion_invariant(branchCount); // Check high branching factor

    return dp[x] = ans + 1;
}

int main() {
    scanf("%d", &k);
    for (i = 1; i <= 9; i++) scanf("%d", &a[i]);

    // Before starting recursion, check if memoization is sufficiently initialized
    check_memoization_invariant(dp[k] == 0 && k > 0);

    // Check if there's a potential performance bottleneck due to close costs
    int minCost = *min_element(a + 1, a + 10);
    int maxCost = *max_element(a + 1, a + 10);
    check_paint_budget_invariant(k > 100 && (maxCost - minCost < 10));

    if (!f(k))
        cout << -1;
    else
        while (w[k] > 0) {
            cout << w[k];
            k -= a[w[k]];
        }
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of Inserted Checks:

- **Recursion Depth and Branching Factor:** The `check_recursion_invariant` function checks if the number of possible branches in the recursion (`branchCount`) exceeds a threshold, indicating potential performance issues.
  
- **Insufficient Memoization:** The `check_memoization_invariant` function ensures the array `dp` is utilized effectively before recursion begins, preventing redundant computations.

- **Large Remaining Paint Budget with Close Costs:** The `check_paint_budget_invariant` function checks if the remaining paint budget is large and costs are very close, which could lead to excessive recursion.
