system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

Igor has fallen in love with Tanya. Now Igor wants to show his feelings and write a number on the fence opposite to Tanya's house. Igor thinks that the larger the number is, the more chance to win Tanya's heart he has. 

Unfortunately, Igor could only get v liters of paint. He did the math and concluded that digit d requires ad liters of paint. Besides, Igor heard that Tanya doesn't like zeroes. That's why Igor won't use them in his number.

Help Igor find the maximum number he can write on the fence.

Input

The first line contains a positive integer v (0 ≤ v ≤ 106). The second line contains nine positive integers a1, a2, ..., a9 (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).

Output

Print the maximum number Igor can write on the fence. If he has too little paint for any digit (so, he cannot write anything), print -1.

assistant: To diagnose the performance bottlenecks and generate performance-characterizing invariants, let's go through the analysis process step-by-step.

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Compare Line-Level Hit Counts:**
   - `calc()` function (lines 7-14) shows significant differences in hit counts between slow and fast inputs:
     - Line 7: Slow input has 113,323 hits while the fast input has 66,773 hits.
     - Line 12: Slow input has 56,647 hits while the fast input has 33,372 hits.

2. **Pinpoint Lines with Significant Hits:**
   - The `calc()` function's recursive calls (`calc(i - 1, v)` and `calc(i, v - f[i])`) are heavily hit in the slow input, indicating recursive depth or branching might be causing inefficiencies.

3. **Inference on Interaction with Data Structures:**
   - The `dp` array is being accessed and modified repeatedly, especially noticeable in lines 10-14.
   - The `vis` array helps avoid recalculating already computed states, but the recursion depth or branching suggests we might be revisiting many states even with this optimization.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **Generate Natural Language Statements:**

   - **Invariant 1:** Recursive Depth and Branching Factor
     - "The program may slow down significantly when the recursive function calculates a large number of states. This is likely when the available paint volume `v` allows many digits to be painted repeatedly or when the cost of digits has large variance, causing deeper recursion or more branching."

2. **Consider Thresholds and Input Patterns:**
   - Given the constraints `v <= 10^6` and `1 <= ai <= 10^5`, the slow scenarios can arise when the paint costs `ai` allow for large numbers of digits to be painted, particularly when the cost of some digits is much lower than others, leading to frequent recursive calls as seen in the slow input.

3. **Correlate Conditions Strongly with Input Patterns:**
   - The slow performance is likely when there is a significant disparity in `ai` values, particularly when the smallest values are much smaller compared to others, causing repetitive calculations on how to maximize digit usage.

### Performance Characterizing Invariants

1. **Invariant Statement:**
   - "If the digit paint costs `ai` have a large variance, with some digits being significantly cheaper than others, and the total paint volume `v` is large enough, the recursive calculation may involve excessive branching and depth, leading to performance degradation."

By identifying these conditions and abstracting the problem to input patterns and recursive computation characteristics, we provide a robust invariant that can help diagnose future slow performance scenarios.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
Igor has fallen in love with Tanya. Now Igor wants to show his feelings and write a number on the fence opposite to Tanya's house. Igor thinks that the larger the number is, the more chance to win Tanya's heart he has. 

Unfortunately, Igor could only get v liters of paint. He did the math and concluded that digit d requires ad liters of paint. Besides, Igor heard that Tanya doesn't like zeroes. That's why Igor won't use them in his number.

Help Igor find the maximum number he can write on the fence.

Input

The first line contains a positive integer v (0 ≤ v ≤ 106). The second line contains nine positive integers a1, a2, ..., a9 (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).

Output

Print the maximum number Igor can write on the fence. If he has too little paint for any digit (so, he cannot write anything), print -1.

assistant: ### Phase 3: Implement the Natural Language Invariants in C++

Based on the invariant derived in Phase 2, we need to implement a check that triggers when there is a large variance in digit paint costs, leading to potential performance bottlenecks due to recursive depth and branching.

Here's how we can implement the invariant as a C++ helper function:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;

void check_variance_invariant(const vector<int>& costs) {
    int minCost = *min_element(costs.begin(), costs.end());
    int maxCost = *max_element(costs.begin(), costs.end());

    if ((maxCost - minCost) > 50000) { // Threshold is arbitrary but reflects a large variance
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to large variance in digit paint costs!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrate Checkers into the Original Program

Now that we have the checker function, we need to integrate it into the existing C++ solution. The check should be placed after reading the input but before the main recursive computation begins.

Here is the instrumented C++ code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int f[10];
vector<int> sol;
int dp[10][1000001];
bool vis[10][1000001];

// Function to check variance in digit costs
void check_variance_invariant(const vector<int>& costs) {
    int minCost = *min_element(costs.begin(), costs.end());
    int maxCost = *max_element(costs.begin(), costs.end());

    if ((maxCost - minCost) > 50000) { // Threshold is arbitrary but reflects a large variance
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to large variance in digit paint costs!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int calc(int i, int v) {
  if (v < 0) return -(1 << 29);
  if (!i) return 0;
  if (vis[i][v] == false) {
    vis[i][v] = true;
    dp[i][v] = max(calc(i - 1, v), 1 + calc(i, v - f[i]));
  }
  return dp[i][v];
}

void print(int i, int v) {
  if (v < 0) return;
  if (!i) return;
  if (dp[i][v] == 1 + calc(i, v - f[i])) {
    printf("%d", i);
    print(i, v - f[i]);
  } else
    print(i - 1, v);
}

int main() {
  int v;
  cin >> v;
  vector<int> costs(9);
  for (int i = 1; i <= 9; ++i) {
    cin >> f[i];
    costs[i - 1] = f[i];
  }

  // Insert check for variance in digit paint costs before heavy computations
  check_variance_invariant(costs);

  int x = calc(9, v);
  if (x > 0)
    print(9, v);
  else
    printf("-1");
  return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

- **Check Placement:** The `check_variance_invariant` function is called right after the inputs are read. This ensures the program checks for potential performance issues before entering the computationally expensive part.
- **Thresholds:** The threshold for triggering the variance check is based on assumptions about significant disparities that could lead to deep recursion or excessive branching.
- **Abort on Trigger:** If the condition is met, the program outputs a warning and aborts, which is useful for fuzzing and detecting performance issues early on.
