system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

Little Vlad is fond of popular computer game Bota-2. Recently, the developers announced the new add-on named Bota-3. Of course, Vlad immediately bought only to find out his computer is too old for the new game and needs to be updated.

There are n video cards in the shop, the power of the i-th video card is equal to integer value ai. As Vlad wants to be sure the new game will work he wants to buy not one, but several video cards and unite their powers using the cutting-edge technology. To use this technology one of the cards is chosen as the leading one and other video cards are attached to it as secondary. For this new technology to work it's required that the power of each of the secondary video cards is divisible by the power of the leading video card. In order to achieve that the power of any secondary video card can be reduced to any integer value less or equal than the current power. However, the power of the leading video card should remain unchanged, i.e. it can't be reduced.

Vlad has an infinite amount of money so he can buy any set of video cards. Help him determine which video cards he should buy such that after picking the leading video card and may be reducing some powers of others to make them work together he will get the maximum total value of video power.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 200 000) — the number of video cards in the shop.

The second line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 200 000) — powers of video cards.

Output

The only line of the output should contain one integer value — the maximum possible total power of video cards working together.

Examples

Input

4
3 2 15 9


Output

27


Input

4
8 2 2 7


Output

18

Note

In the first sample, it would be optimal to buy video cards with powers 3, 15 and 9. The video card with power 3 should be chosen as the leading one and all other video cards will be compatible with it. Thus, the total power would be 3 + 15 + 9 = 27. If he buys all the video cards and pick the one with the power 2 as the leading, the powers of all other video cards should be reduced by 1, thus the total power would be 2 + 2 + 14 + 8 = 26, that is less than 27. Please note, that it's not allowed to reduce the power of the leading video card, i.e. one can't get the total power 3 + 1 + 15 + 9 = 28.

In the second sample, the optimal answer is to buy all video cards and pick the one with the power 2 as the leading. The video card with the power 7 needs it power to be reduced down to 6. The total power would be 8 + 2 + 2 + 6 = 18.

assistant: To analyze and derive performance-characterizing invariants from the given C code, let's go through the steps as outlined:

**Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments**

1. **Compare Line-Level Hit Counts**: 
   - The primary loop (lines 17-21) is where a significant difference in hit counts occurs between the slow input and the fast input. Specifically, line 17 (`while (j <= 200000)`) is hit 435,242 times for the slow input compared to 235,241 times for the fast input.

2. **Pinpoint Lines or Functions with More Hits in Slow Input**: 
   - The while loop that iterates over possible multiples of `a[i]` (`line 17`) and the operations inside it (`lines 18-21`) are the main culprits of increased execution time on the slow input. 

3. **Infer Interaction with Data Structures, Loops, etc.**:
   - The loop inside the `while` on line 17 seems to be the source of inefficiency. This loop's performance hinges on how many times it iterates, which is determined by how `j` progresses with increments of `a[i]`. The hit count difference indicates that certain values of `a[i]` cause the loop to iterate many more times.

**Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants**

1. **Natural Language Statements on Slow Path Conditions**:
   - **Invariant #1**: "If a video card with a small power value is chosen as the leading card, and is a divisor for many other card power values, the program may enter a slow execution path due to increased iterations over multiples of this small value."
   - **Invariant #2**: "When the number of distinct divisors among the card powers is low, especially with small leading values, the algorithm may repetitively evaluate the same sets of cards, causing slow performance."

2. **Abstract Input Patterns**:
   - These conditions are abstract and do not rely on specific numeric values from the slow input. The general pattern is that the computational cost is higher when the chosen leading power value has many contributing multiples within the card set.

3. **Ensure Broadness but Realistic Triggers**:
   - The invariants focus on characteristics like the divisibility relations and how they lead to repetitive and extensive calculations as the loop over possible multiples runs too many times. Given the constraint \( n \leq 200,000 \), these statements help in understanding potential slowdowns even when \( n \) is not maximized but when specific divisibility patterns are prevalent.

**Output Requirements - Concise Set of Performance Triggers**:

- **Invariant #1**: Performance may degrade if a small power value is chosen as the leading card and there are many video cards whose powers are divisible by this small value, causing excessive iterations in calculating potential combinations.

- **Invariant #2**: If several video card powers share a common small divisor and this divisor is used frequently as the leading card, the program may run significantly slower due to redundant calculations over common multiples or divisor relationships. 

These invariants provide insight into how the nature of divisibility among the powers of video cards can lead to inefficient computations when suboptimal leading cards are chosen, resulting in increased iteration counts within the nested loop logic.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
Little Vlad is fond of popular computer game Bota-2. Recently, the developers announced the new add-on named Bota-3. Of course, Vlad immediately bought only to find out his computer is too old for the new game and needs to be updated.

There are n video cards in the shop, the power of the i-th video card is equal to integer value ai. As Vlad wants to be sure the new game will work he wants to buy not one, but several video cards and unite their powers using the cutting-edge technology. To use this technology one of the cards is chosen as the leading one and other video cards are attached to it as secondary. For this new technology to work it's required that the power of each of the secondary video cards is divisible by the power of the leading video card. In order to achieve that the power of any secondary video card can be reduced to any integer value less or equal than the current power. However, the power of the leading video card should remain unchanged, i.e. it can't be reduced.

Vlad has an infinite amount of money so he can buy any set of video cards. Help him determine which video cards he should buy such that after picking the leading video card and may be reducing some powers of others to make them work together he will get the maximum total value of video power.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 200 000) — the number of video cards in the shop.

The second line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 200 000) — powers of video cards.

Output

The only line of the output should contain one integer value — the maximum possible total power of video cards working together.

Examples

Input

4
3 2 15 9


Output

27


Input

4
8 2 2 7


Output

18

Note

In the first sample, it would be optimal to buy video cards with powers 3, 15 and 9. The video card with power 3 should be chosen as the leading one and all other video cards will be compatible with it. Thus, the total power would be 3 + 15 + 9 = 27. If he buys all the video cards and pick the one with the power 2 as the leading, the powers of all other video cards should be reduced by 1, thus the total power would be 2 + 2 + 14 + 8 = 26, that is less than 27. Please note, that it's not allowed to reduce the power of the leading video card, i.e. one can't get the total power 3 + 1 + 15 + 9 = 28.

In the second sample, the optimal answer is to buy all video cards and pick the one with the power 2 as the leading. The video card with the power 7 needs it power to be reduced down to 6. The total power would be 8 + 2 + 2 + 6 = 18.

Solution (C++ code):
{solution}


assistant: ### Phase 3: Implementing Checkers for Invariants

Based on the natural language invariants derived, we'll implement the checks in C++. These checks will help identify when the program might experience performance slowdowns.

#### Invariant #1 Implementation
**Description**: If a small power value is chosen as the leading card and there are many video cards whose powers are divisible by this small value, it may trigger excessive iterations.

```cpp
void check_leading_card_invariant(int leading_card, int power_count) {
    if (leading_card < 10 && power_count > 10000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - small leading card with many divisors" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

#### Invariant #2 Implementation
**Description**: When several video card powers share a common small divisor, using this divisor frequently as the leading card might cause performance issues.

```cpp
void check_common_divisor_invariant(int divisor_count) {
    if (divisor_count > 5000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive common divisor usage" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrating Checkers into the C++ Program

Now that we have the checker functions, we need to integrate them into the existing C++ program. We'll place these checks at points where they can effectively identify potential performance issues without adding overhead to tight loops.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
const int maxn = 2e5 + 233;
int a[maxn];

// Checker function for invariant #1
void check_leading_card_invariant(int leading_card, int power_count) {
    if (leading_card < 10 && power_count > 10000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - small leading card with many divisors" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Checker function for invariant #2
void check_common_divisor_invariant(int divisor_count) {
    if (divisor_count > 5000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive common divisor usage" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    long long ans = 0;
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) scanf("%d", &a[i]);
    
    sort(a + 1, a + 1 + n);
    a[n + 1] = 2e9;
    a[0] = -1;

**Comments on Integration:**
- **Check for Invariant #1**: We determine the number of cards divisible by each potential leading card and check if this number is high when the leading card's power is small.
- **Check for Invariant #2**: The detection of many common divisors is indirectly managed by the same logic since it tends to focus on frequent small leading card candidates.

This integration should assist in identifying scenarios where the program might face significant performance degradation due to the characteristics of the input data.
