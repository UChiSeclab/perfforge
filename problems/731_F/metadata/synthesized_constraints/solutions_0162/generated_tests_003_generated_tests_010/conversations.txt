system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

Little Vlad is fond of popular computer game Bota-2. Recently, the developers announced the new add-on named Bota-3. Of course, Vlad immediately bought only to find out his computer is too old for the new game and needs to be updated.

There are n video cards in the shop, the power of the i-th video card is equal to integer value ai. As Vlad wants to be sure the new game will work he wants to buy not one, but several video cards and unite their powers using the cutting-edge technology. To use this technology one of the cards is chosen as the leading one and other video cards are attached to it as secondary. For this new technology to work it's required that the power of each of the secondary video cards is divisible by the power of the leading video card. In order to achieve that the power of any secondary video card can be reduced to any integer value less or equal than the current power. However, the power of the leading video card should remain unchanged, i.e. it can't be reduced.

Vlad has an infinite amount of money so he can buy any set of video cards. Help him determine which video cards he should buy such that after picking the leading video card and may be reducing some powers of others to make them work together he will get the maximum total value of video power.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 200 000) — the number of video cards in the shop.

The second line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 200 000) — powers of video cards.

Output

The only line of the output should contain one integer value — the maximum possible total power of video cards working together.

Examples

Input

4
3 2 15 9


Output

27


Input

4
8 2 2 7


Output

18

Note

In the first sample, it would be optimal to buy video cards with powers 3, 15 and 9. The video card with power 3 should be chosen as the leading one and all other video cards will be compatible with it. Thus, the total power would be 3 + 15 + 9 = 27. If he buys all the video cards and pick the one with the power 2 as the leading, the powers of all other video cards should be reduced by 1, thus the total power would be 2 + 2 + 14 + 8 = 26, that is less than 27. Please note, that it's not allowed to reduce the power of the leading video card, i.e. one can't get the total power 3 + 1 + 15 + 9 = 28.

In the second sample, the optimal answer is to buy all video cards and pick the one with the power 2 as the leading. The video card with the power 7 needs it power to be reduced down to 6. The total power would be 8 + 2 + 2 + 6 = 18.

assistant: To analyze why the provided C program performs slowly under certain inputs, let's first go through the two phases mentioned:

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Line-Level Hit Count Comparison:**
   - Lines 28 to 49 are executed significantly more for the slow input compared to the fast input. This block of code performs calculations for each potential leading power value from 2 to 200,004.
   - Lines 35 to 47, which involve nested loops, account for the majority of the hit counts, suggesting that they are particularly expensive.

2. **Pinpoint Inefficient Lines or Functions:**
   - **Lines 35-37**: The loop marks multiples of `i` using `color[j] = true`, iterating for each multiple of `i`.
   - **Lines 42-47**: The do-while loop computes the total power for a leading video card power `i`, updating `power` with contributions from compatible secondary cards.

3. **Inferring Interaction with Data Structures:**
   - The code iterates over a large range of potential leading video card powers, even if there are sparse or no cards available at those powers. This causes unnecessary iterations and checks, especially when powers like 5 form a significant portion of the input.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the analysis, here are some potential performance-characterizing invariants explaining slowdown conditions:

1. **High Multiplicity Scenario:**
   - Natural Language Description: "If the input contains a high frequency of a particular power value, and many multiples of that value exist within the range up to 200,000, the program may perform excessive iterations to check compatibility."
   - This occurs because the program checks all possible powers up to a large number, even when only a few are relevant, resulting in redundant calculations.

2. **Lack of Early Termination for Trivial Cases:**
   - Natural Language Description: "When there are no video cards with power equal to 1, and all other powers are higher, the program executes extensive checks and comparisons that are unnecessary, potentially leading to high execution times."
   - The presence of a card with power 1 optimizes the solution directly by taking the sum of all powers, whereas its absence leads to a complete exploration of possibilities.

3. **Sparse Power Distribution:**
   - Natural Language Description: "When video card powers are sparse across a large range, each potential leading power results in redundant calculations for non-existent secondary cards, leading to a slowdown."
   - The program does not effectively skip ranges of powers with no corresponding cards, causing inefficiencies.

By understanding these invariants, one can optimize the program by limiting the range of considered leading powers based on the actual distribution of video card powers, or by introducing conditions that improve efficiency when certain trivial cases are detected.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:

The only line of the output should contain one integer value — the maximum possible total power of video cards working together.

Examples

Input

4
3 2 15 9


Output

27


Input

4
8 2 2 7


Output

18

Note

In the first sample, it would be optimal to buy video cards with powers 3, 15 and 9. The video card with power 3 should be chosen as the leading one and all other video cards will be compatible with it. Thus, the total power would be 3 + 15 + 9 = 27. If he buys all the video cards and pick the one with the power 2 as the leading, the powers of all other video cards should be reduced by 1, thus the total power would be 2 + 2 + 14 + 8 = 26, that is less than 27. Please note, that it's not allowed to reduce the power of the leading video card, i.e. one can't get the total power 3 + 1 + 15 + 9 = 28.

In the second sample, the optimal answer is to buy all video cards and pick the one with the power 2 as the leading. The video card with the power 7 needs it power to be reduced down to 6. The total power would be 8 + 2 + 2 + 6 = 18.

assistant: Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++

Based on the performance-characterizing invariants identified earlier, here are the C++ code snippets to check for those conditions at runtime:

1. **High Multiplicity Scenario:**
   This check aims to detect when the input contains a high frequency of a particular power value that leads to excessive iterations in nested loops.

   ```cpp
   void check_high_multiplicity_invariant(const int* cnt, int threshold) {
       for (int i = 2; i < 200005; ++i) {
           if (cnt[i] >= threshold) {
               cerr << "Warning: High multiplicity invariant triggered - excessive iterations expected for power " << i << endl;
               abort();
           }
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Lack of Early Termination for Trivial Cases:**
   This check ensures we detect the absence of a card with power 1, which might lead to unnecessary computations.

   ```cpp
   void check_early_termination_invariant(bool there_ai_eq_1) {
       if (!there_ai_eq_1) {
           cerr << "Warning: Early termination invariant triggered - no card with power 1 present" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Sparse Power Distribution:**
   This checks when video card powers are sparse, potentially leading to redundant calculations.

   ```cpp
   void check_sparse_distribution_invariant(const int* cnt) {
       int sparse_count = 0;
       for (int i = 2; i < 200005; ++i) {
           if (cnt[i] > 0) {
               ++sparse_count;
           }
       }
       if (sparse_count < 10) {  // Arbitrary threshold for sparseness
           cerr << "Warning: Sparse distribution invariant triggered - redundant calculations likely" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Integrate the Checker Code into the Original Program

Now let's integrate these checks into the existing C++ code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int a[200005], cnt[200005], acc_cnt[200005];
bool color[200005];
int n;

// Checker function implementations
void check_high_multiplicity_invariant(const int* cnt, int threshold) {
    for (int i = 2; i < 200005; ++i) {
        if (cnt[i] >= threshold) {
            cerr << "Warning: High multiplicity invariant triggered - excessive iterations expected for power " << i << endl;
            abort();
        }
    }
}

void check_early_termination_invariant(bool there_ai_eq_1) {
    if (!there_ai_eq_1) {
        cerr << "Warning: Early termination invariant triggered - no card with power 1 present" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_sparse_distribution_invariant(const int* cnt) {
    int sparse_count = 0;
    for (int i = 2; i < 200005; ++i) {
        if (cnt[i] > 0) {
            ++sparse_count;
        }
    }
    if (sparse_count < 10) {  // Arbitrary threshold for sparseness
        cerr << "Warning: Sparse distribution invariant triggered - redundant calculations likely" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    scanf("%d", &n);
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        scanf("%d", &a[i]);
    }

    bool there_ai_eq_1 = false;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        if (a[i] == 1) {
            there_ai_eq_1 = true;
        }
    }

    // Check for early termination conditions
    check_early_termination_invariant(there_ai_eq_1);

    if (there_ai_eq_1) {
        long long int sum = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            sum += a[i];
        }
        cout << sum;
        return 0;
    }

    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        cnt[a[i]]++;
    }
    
    // Check for high multiplicity and sparse distribution
    check_high_multiplicity_invariant(cnt, n / 10);  // Arbitrary ratio threshold
    check_sparse_distribution_invariant(cnt);

    for (int i = 2; i < 200005; i++) {
        acc_cnt[i] = acc_cnt[i - 1] + cnt[i];
    }
    long long int ans = 0;
    for (int i = 2; i < 200005; i++) {
        if (cnt[i] > 0 && color[i] == false) {
            int j = i;
            while (j < 200005) {
                color[j] = true;
                j += i;
            }
            j = i;
            long long int multi = i;
            long long int power = 0;
            do {
                j += i;
                j = min(j, 200005 - 1);
                power += (acc_cnt[j - 1] - acc_cnt[multi - 1]) * multi;
                multi += i;
            } while (j < 200005 - 1);
            ans = max(ans, power);
        }
    }
    cout << ans;
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

- **Check Functions**: The check functions are implemented as separate functions for clarity and reusability. They are invoked at appropriate points in the main logic to detect the described conditions.
- **Early Termination Check**: This is placed right after determining if any card has the power of 1, which directly leads to an optimal solution.
- **Multiplicative and Sparse Checks**: These are placed after initial array processing, ensuring they do not interfere with performance in tight loops.
- The conditions used in checks (like thresholds) are arbitrary and can be fine-tuned based on empirical analysis or testing.
