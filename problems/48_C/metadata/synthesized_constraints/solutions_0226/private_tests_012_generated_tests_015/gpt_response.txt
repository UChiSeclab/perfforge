### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

Upon reviewing the hit counts and the code, the following observations can be made regarding the lines with significant hit count differences between the slow and fast inputs:

1. **Line 18**: The outer loop increments `cur` by `0.000001` and runs from `cur = a[0] * 10` to `cur <= a[0] * 10 + 10`. This loop runs `10,000,000` times for the slow input, compared to `5,000,000` times for the fast input.

2. **Lines 21-23**: The nested loop iterates over the petrol station stops and gets executed a substantial number of times, specifically `10,000,001` times for the slow input versus `5,000,002` times for the fast input.

3. **Line 28**: The condition checking `if (c < 0)` is met frequently, resulting in frequent breaks from the inner loop.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the identified expensive or inefficient segments, the following natural language performance invariants can be derived:

1. **Fine Granularity in Floating Point Iteration**:
   - **Description**: The program uses very fine increments (`0.000001`) in a loop over a floating point range. This can lead to a large number of iterations, significantly impacting performance, especially when the range is such that the loop does not break early.
   - **Invariant**: "When the range of potential `α` values is too narrow, and the increment is very fine, the loop may result in excessive iterations."

2. **Frequent Inner Loop Breaks**:
   - **Description**: The inner loop frequently breaks due to the condition `c < 0`, indicating that many `cur` values do not satisfy the conditions, leading to potentially unnecessary checks.
   - **Invariant**: "If the difference between consecutive petrol station stops is irregular and doesn’t allow `c` to stay positive for long across iterations, the inner loop may break often, causing inefficiency."

3. **High Frequency of Non-unique Determination**:
   - **Description**: The program struggles with non-unique determinations of the next petrol station stop when there are multiple possible `α` values, leading to extensive computations over the range.
   - **Invariant**: "When the sequence of stops allows multiple valid interpretations for `α`, the search space increases, leading to longer computation times."

### Summary

The slow performance is primarily caused by the fine granularity of the floating-point iteration and frequent breaks in the nested loop due to the `c < 0` condition. These factors, combined with scenarios where the determination of the next stop is not unique, lead to the observed performance bottlenecks. Adjusting the granularity of `cur` increments or optimizing the search space based on observed patterns could help mitigate these issues.

### Phase 3: Implement Invariants as C++ Checker Code

Below are the C++ code snippets implementing the performance-characterizing invariants derived earlier.

1. **Fine Granularity in Floating Point Iteration**:

   This invariant checks if the number of iterations in the loop that increments `cur` is excessively high due to fine granularity, potentially indicating a performance bottleneck:
   
   ```cpp
   void check_fine_granularity_invariant(double start, double end, double increment) {
       if ((end - start) / increment > 10000000) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive iterations due to fine granularity!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Frequent Inner Loop Breaks**:

   This invariant checks for frequent breaks in the inner loop, which can signify inefficient execution when consecutive station intervals cause `c` to drop below zero repeatedly:
   
   ```cpp
   void check_frequent_breaks_invariant(int breakCount, int n) {
       if (breakCount > n / 2) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - frequent inner loop breaks!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **High Frequency of Non-unique Determination**:

   This invariant checks if the solution is non-unique due to multiple valid `α` values, which can lead to excessive exploration:
   
   ```cpp
   void check_non_unique_invariant(bool first, int x, int y) {
       if (!first && x != y) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - non-unique solution space!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Integrate Checker Code into the Original Program

Here is the instrumented C++ code with the checker functions integrated at appropriate points:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

const long double EPS = 1e-9;
const long double PI = 3.1415926535897932384626433832795;
const int INF = 1000 * 1000 * 1000;
const int NMAX = 1000 * 1000;
long ans, i, j, k, l, n, m, x, y;
double mx, cur, c;
bool first = true;
long a[1000];
long long mn;

// Checker functions to detect performance bottlenecks
void check_fine_granularity_invariant(double start, double end, double increment) {
    if ((end - start) / increment > 10000000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive iterations due to fine granularity!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_frequent_breaks_invariant(int breakCount, int n) {
    if (breakCount > n / 2) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - frequent inner loop breaks!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_non_unique_invariant(bool first, int x, int y) {
    if (!first && x != y) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - non-unique solution space!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    freopen("out.deb", "w", stderr);
    scanf("%d", &n);
    for ((i) = (0); (i) < (n); (i)++) scanf("%d", &a[i]);
    mx = 10 + (a[1] - a[0]) * 10;

    // Check for excessive iterations due to fine granularity
    check_fine_granularity_invariant(a[0] * 10, a[0] * 10 + 10, 0.000001);

    int breakCount = 0;
    for (cur = a[0] * 10; cur <= a[0] * 10 + 10; cur += 0.000001) {
        c = cur - a[0] * 10;
        if (c > 10) break;
        for ((i) = (1); (i) < (n); (i)++) {
            c += cur;
            c -= (a[i] - a[i - 1]) * 10;
            if (c > 10) {
                printf("unique\n%d", x);
                return 0;
            }
            if (c < 0) {
                breakCount++;
                break;
            }
        }
        // Check for frequent inner loop breaks
        check_frequent_breaks_invariant(breakCount, n);

        if (c + cur > 0 && i == n) {
            y = (c + cur) / 10 + a[n - 1];
            if (first) {
                x = y;
                first = false;
            }
            // Check for non-unique solution space
            check_non_unique_invariant(first, x, y);

            if (x != y) {
                printf("not unique");
                return 0;
            }
        }
    }
    printf("unique\n%d", x);
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

- **Check for Fine Granularity**: The `check_fine_granularity_invariant` is placed before the loop starts, ensuring that the loop will not run excessively due to too small increments.
  
- **Check for Frequent Breaks**: The `check_frequent_breaks_invariant` is called after the nested loop, counting how often the loop breaks early due to `c < 0`.

- **Check for Non-unique Solutions**: The `check_non_unique_invariant` is invoked when deciding if the solution is unique or not, ensuring that multiple potential `α` values do not cause unnecessary calculations.
