### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

Based on the hit count data, we can identify the following observations:

1. **Line 35 (`for (int z = 0; z < 500; z++)`):** This line is executed a total of 1002 times in both fast and slow inputs, indicating a large number of iterations in the binary search loop within the `GetBound` function. The high iteration count is expected since it runs a fixed number of times (500 in this case).

2. **Lines 45 to 59:** These lines represent the inner while-loop execution within the `GetBound` function, specifically handling petrol station simulations. The `slow_hit_count` for these lines is much higher (9635 times for line 45) compared to `fast_hit_count` (1000 times for line 45). This suggests that the `slow` input performs significantly more operations in the while-loop compared to the `fast` input.

3. **Line 57 (`i++`) and Line 58 (`if (i >= N)`):** These lines are executed a high number of times (9138 and 506 times for slow and fast inputs, respectively). Noticeably, the slow input executes these lines significantly more, implying deeper iteration through input data.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

#### Performance Invariants

1. **Invariant 1: Large Number of Iterations within the Binary Search Loop**

   - **Natural language description:** 
     "The program may slow down when the number of petrol stations `n` is large, causing the binary search loop in the `GetBound` function to perform many iterations to simulate possible refueling sequences."

2. **Invariant 2: High Frequency of Inner Loop Executions in Simulation**

   - **Natural language description:** 
     "When the sequence of station stops is such that frequent refueling is computed within the simulation (inner loop of `GetBound`), this could lead to performance degradation. This occurs when the stops are closely spaced in the progression."

3. **Invariant 3: Complexity of Sequential Simulation**

   - **Natural language description:** 
     "The performance might deteriorate when the series of station stops create a scenario where multiple potential values for `alpha` (petrol fill-up) need to be cross-verified for both bounds, leading to extensive computation in the `GetFinalStation` function."

### Summary

The performance of the program can be adversely affected by:

- A large input size `n`, which increases the iteration count in the binary search for bounds.
- Closely spaced station numbers in the sequence, leading to repeated computations within the simulation loop.
- The necessity to verify multiple hypothetical `alpha` values, which increases the complexity and execution time of the function. 

These conditions align with the problem constraints and provide a framework for understanding potential slowdowns in different scenarios.

### Phase 3: Implementing Invariants in C++

Below are C++ code snippets representing the runtime checks for each invariant:

1. **Invariant 1: Large Number of Iterations within the Binary Search Loop**

   ```cpp
   void check_large_input_invariant(int n) {
       if (n > 500) { // Considering n > 500 as a performance bottleneck threshold
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to large number of petrol stations!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Invariant 2: High Frequency of Inner Loop Executions in Simulation**

   ```cpp
   void check_frequent_stops_invariant(const int stops[], int n) {
       for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
           if (stops[i] - stops[i-1] < 5) { // If stops are too close, indicating frequent computation
               cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to closely spaced station stops!" << endl;
               abort();
           }
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Invariant 3: Complexity of Sequential Simulation**

   ```cpp
   void check_sequential_simulation_invariant(double lower, double upper) {
       if (fabs(upper - lower) < EPS) { // If bounds are very close, implying extensive computations
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to sequential simulation complexity!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Integrating Checkers into the Original Program

Here is the instrumented C++ program with the runtime checks integrated:

  return fabs(x - y) <= EPS * max(1.0, max(fabs(x), fabs(y)));
}
double SQSUM(double x, double y) { return x * x + y * y; }
template <class T>
bool INRANGE(T x, T a, T b) {
  return a <= x && x <= b;
}

```

### Explanation

- **`check_large_input_invariant`:** This function is called immediately after reading `N` to ensure the input size does not exceed the threshold.
- **`check_frequent_stops_invariant`:** This function is invoked after reading the sequence of stops, ensuring no two consecutive stops are too close.
- **`check_sequential_simulation_invariant`:** This function checks if the bounds derived from the binary search are too close, which would indicate a potential performance bottleneck. It is called after computing both bounds.

These checks are strategically placed to avoid overhead in tight loops, while effectively monitoring the conditions that could lead to a slowdown.
