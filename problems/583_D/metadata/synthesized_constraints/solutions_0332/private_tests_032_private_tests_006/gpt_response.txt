**Phase 1: Identify expensive or inefficient code segments**

From the hit count information, the following observations can be made:

1. **`lisLength` Function**: This function is called multiple times during both the fast and slow inputs. However, the hit counts for the slow input are significantly higher, especially for lines 16-22. 
   - Line 16 (loop): The loop runs `n * n` times for slow input as opposed to `t * n` for fast input, increasing from 10,001 to 2,000,200 times.
   - Lines 18-22: The use of `upper_bound` and updating elements of the `lis` vector show a dramatic increase in operations, indicating potential inefficiencies in handling larger datasets or more varied input.

2. **Main Function Logic**:  
   - Lines 44-47: The slow input goes through a nested loop where `lisLength` is called multiple times and involves `n * n` operations. This part of the code is hit 100 times in the slow input compared to 0 in the fast input, suggesting this path is responsible for the slowdown.

**Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants**

Based on the observations, here are the natural language performance invariants:

1. **Invariant 1**: 
   - **Description**: When the repeated pattern length `T` is significantly larger than `n`, the program takes a slow path where it computes the longest increasing subsequence for multiple segments, leading to increased operations.
   - **Condition**: "If `T` exceeds twice the value of `n`, the code may enter a slow path due to excessive subsequence calculations."

2. **Invariant 2**: 
   - **Description**: The computation becomes inefficient when the input array `a` contains many unique elements, leading to a higher number of operations in constructing the longest non-decreasing subsequence.
   - **Condition**: "If the input array `a` has a high degree of uniqueness, leading to many distinct values, the function for calculating the subsequence may be executed excessively."

3. **Invariant 3**: 
   - **Description**: When the input size `n` is at its upper constraint and involves diverse values, the operations inside the loop become the main performance bottleneck.
   - **Condition**: "If `n` is at its maximum constraint of 100, and the input sequence is diverse, operations for managing non-decreasing subsequences increase significantly."

By incorporating these invariants, future runs of the program can be analyzed to determine potential slow paths and further optimize the algorithm's efficiency. These conditions focus on high `T` values relative to `n`, the uniqueness of elements in `a`, and maximum constraints of `n`, which are realistic triggers given the problem constraints.

### Phase 3: Implementing the Natural Language Invariants in C++

Based on the performance-characterizing invariants, here are the checkers implemented in C++:

1. **Invariant 1**: Checking if `T` is significantly larger than `n`.

```cpp
void check_large_T_vs_n(int T, int n) {
    if (T > 2 * n) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - T is significantly larger than n!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

2. **Invariant 2**: Checking for a high degree of uniqueness in the input array `a`.

```cpp
void check_high_uniqueness(const int a[], int n) {
    set<int> unique_elements(a, a + n);
    if (unique_elements.size() > n / 2) {  // Example threshold: more than half elements are unique
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high degree of uniqueness in input array!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

3. **Invariant 3**: Checking if `n` is at its maximum constraint and involves diverse values.

```cpp
void check_max_n_constraint(int n, const int a[]) {
    set<int> unique_elements(a, a + n);
    if (n == 100 && unique_elements.size() > 50) {  // Example threshold
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - max n constraint with diverse input!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Instrumenting the Original C++ Code with Checkers

Here is the original C++ solution augmented with the invariant checks:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Check if `T` is significantly larger than `n`.
void check_large_T_vs_n(int T, int n) {
    if (T > 2 * n) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - T is significantly larger than n!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Check for a high degree of uniqueness in the input array `a`.
void check_high_uniqueness(const int a[], int n) {
    set<int> unique_elements(a, a + n);
    if (unique_elements.size() > n / 2) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high degree of uniqueness in input array!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Check if `n` is at its maximum constraint and involves diverse values.
void check_max_n_constraint(int n, const int a[]) {
    set<int> unique_elements(a, a + n);
    if (n == 100 && unique_elements.size() > 50) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - max n constraint with diverse input!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int lisLength(int a[], int n, int mn, int mx) {
    vector<int> lis;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        if (a[i] >= mn && a[i] <= mx) {
            vector<int>::iterator it = upper_bound(lis.begin(), lis.end(), a[i]);
            if (it == lis.end())
                lis.push_back(a[i]);
            else
                *it = a[i];
        }
    return lis.size();
}

int main() {
    int n, t;
    scanf("%d", &n);
    scanf("%d", &t);
    int a[110], b[20020];
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) scanf("%d", &a[i]);

    // Insert invariant checks after input is read.
    check_large_T_vs_n(t, n);
    check_high_uniqueness(a, n);
    check_max_n_constraint(n, a);

    for (int i = 0; i < min(t, n); i++)
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) b[i * n + j] = a[j];
    if (t <= n)
        printf("%d\n", lisLength(b, t * n, INT_MIN, INT_MAX));
    else if (t <= 2 * n) {
        for (int i = n; i < t; i++)
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) b[i * n + j] = a[j];
        printf("%d\n", lisLength(b, t * n, INT_MIN, INT_MAX));
    } else {
        int cnt[330] = {0};
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) cnt[a[i]]++;
        int ans = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
            ans = max(ans, lisLength(b, n * n, INT_MIN, a[i]) +
                             cnt[a[i]] * (t - 2 * n) +
                             lisLength(b, n * n, a[i], INT_MAX));
        printf("%d\n", ans);
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of Instrumentation

- The invariant checks are added right after reading the input values, ensuring they are run before any heavy computation begins.
- Each check is implemented as a function to ensure clean and modular code, making it easy to adjust thresholds or add additional complexity if required.
- The use of `abort()` ensures that if a condition is triggered, the program halts immediately, aiding in the detection of performance bottlenecks during testing or fuzzing.
