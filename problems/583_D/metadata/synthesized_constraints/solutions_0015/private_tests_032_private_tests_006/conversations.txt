system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

You are given an array of positive integers a1, a2, ..., an × T of length n × T. We know that for any i > n it is true that ai = ai - n. Find the length of the longest non-decreasing sequence of the given array.

Input

The first line contains two space-separated integers: n, T (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ T ≤ 107). The second line contains n space-separated integers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 300).

Output

Print a single number — the length of a sought sequence.

Examples

Input

4 3
3 1 4 2


Output

5

Note

The array given in the sample looks like that: 3, 1, 4, 2, 3, 1, 4, 2, 3, 1, 4, 2. The elements in bold form the largest non-decreasing subsequence.

assistant: ### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

From the given hit count data, we can draw the following observations:

1. **Function Selection Based on `t`:**
   - The `brut()` function is invoked when `t <= 2 * n`, which happens in the fast input scenario, and thus, the function is hit frequently in the fast input but not at all in the slow input.

2. **`fix()` Function with Slow Input:**
   - The `fix()` function is called 100 times for the slow input, but not at all for the fast input. 
   - The function `fix()` involves two major nested loops (lines 21-23 and lines 34-36) that iterate over `n`, leading to a quadratic complexity in terms of `n`. These loops are the major contributors to the performance difference.
   - Within these loops, the `upper_bound` operation (lines 25 and 38) is repeatedly called in another loop that processes the `v` vector, which grows significantly due to the nested structure.
   - Furthermore, the update operations on `sol` (lines 27 and 40) and element assignments (lines 29 and 42) are heavily hit, indicating frequent modifications to the vector, which may involve costly memory operations such as shifting elements.

3. **Data Structure Interactions:**
   - The repeated resizing and updating of the `v` and `sol` vectors in the `fix()` function indicate potential inefficiencies due to vector growth and shrinkage, especially as the vector may frequently reallocate memory when it exceeds its capacity.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the analysis from Phase 1, we can derive the following performance-characterizing invariants:

1. **Invariant 1: High `t` Value with Quadratic Loop Execution**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "When the value of `t` is significantly greater than `2 * n`, and `n` is large (close to 100), the program enters a slower execution path involving nested loops that repeatedly process elements, leading to quadratic complexity."
   - **Explanation:** High values of `t` trigger the use of the `fix()` function, which involves costly nested loops iterating up to `n^2` times, leading to a significant increase in execution time for large `n`.

2. **Invariant 2: Vector Growth and Upper Bound Operations**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "If the vectors involved in the `fix()` function grow large due to repeated insertions, and they are frequently processed with `upper_bound` operations, the program's performance may degrade due to increased memory and processing overhead."
   - **Explanation:** Large vector sizes in combination with frequent binary search operations (via `upper_bound`) and modifications (insertions, updates) can lead to substantial slowdowns, especially when vectors are resized multiple times.

3. **Invariant 3: Inefficient Use of Repeated Data Substructures**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "When data structures are repeatedly rebuilt or processed without optimizations, such as taking advantage of known patterns or properties (e.g., periodicity), the performance can be significantly hindered."
   - **Explanation:** The periodic nature of the input array (elements repeating every `n` elements) is not utilized to optimize data processing, leading to redundant operations within the nested loops of the `fix()` function.

These invariants aim to capture the general conditions under which the program may experience a slowdown, by focusing on structural inefficiencies and algorithmic complexity rather than specific input values.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function

Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
You are given an array of positive integers a1, a2, ..., an × T of length n × T. We know that for any i > n it is true that ai = ai - n. Find the length of the longest non-decreasing sequence of the given array.

Input

The first line contains two space-separated integers: n, T (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ T ≤ 107). The second line contains n space-separated integers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 300).

Output

Print a single number — the length of a sought sequence.

Examples

Input

4 3
3 1 4 2


Output

5

Note

The array given in the sample looks like that: 3, 1, 4, 2, 3, 1, 4, 2, 3, 1, 4, 2. The elements in bold form the largest non-decreasing subsequence. 

Solution (C++ code):
{solution}


assistant: ### Phase 3: Implement Performance-Characterizing Invariants in C++

Below are the checker functions implemented in C++ based on the natural language invariants derived earlier.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Checker for Invariant 1: High `t` Value with Quadratic Loop Execution
void check_t_large_invariant(int n, int t) {
    if (t > 2 * n && n >= 90) { // Consider `n` large if close to the maximum, e.g., 90
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to large 't' and 'n'!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Checker for Invariant 2: Vector Growth and Upper Bound Operations
void check_vector_growth_invariant(int vectorSize) {
    if (vectorSize > 1000) { // Use a reasonable threshold based on analysis
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to large vector size!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Checker for Invariant 3: Inefficient Use of Repeated Data Substructures
void check_repeated_structures_invariant(bool inefficientUsage) {
    if (inefficientUsage) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to inefficient data structure usage!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrate Checkers into the Original C++ Program

Below is the instrumented C++ program with the integrated checker functions at appropriate points to detect potential performance bottlenecks.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

const int MAXN = 1100;
int n, p[MAXN], t, cnt[MAXN], hi = -1, maks = -1;
int ans;

// Checker functions
void check_t_large_invariant(int n, int t) {
    if (t > 2 * n && n >= 90) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to large 't' and 'n'!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_vector_growth_invariant(int vectorSize) {
    if (vectorSize > 1000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to large vector size!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_repeated_structures_invariant(bool inefficientUsage) {
    if (inefficientUsage) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to inefficient data structure usage!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void brut() {
    vector<int> v, sol;
    for (int j = (0); j < int(t); j++)
        for (int i = (0); i < int(n); i++) v.push_back(p[i]);
    for (int i = (0); i < int((int)v.size()); i++) {
        vector<int>::iterator it = upper_bound((sol).begin(), (sol).end(), v[i]);
        if (it == sol.end())
            sol.push_back(v[i]);
        else
            *it = v[i];
    }
    printf("%d\n", (int)sol.size());
}

void fix(int x) {
    vector<int> v, sol;
    
    // Check for vector growth invariant
    check_vector_growth_invariant(v.size());
    
    for (int k = (0); k < int(n); k++)
        for (int i = (0); i < int(n); i++)
            if (p[i] <= x) v.push_back(p[i]);
    for (int i = (0); i < int((int)v.size()); i++) {
        vector<int>::iterator it = upper_bound((sol).begin(), (sol).end(), v[i]);
        if (it == sol.end())
            sol.push_back(v[i]);
        else
            *it = v[i];
    }
    int a = (int)sol.size();
    sol.clear();
    v.clear();
    for (int k = (0); k < int(n); k++)
        for (int i = (0); i < int(n); i++)
            if (p[i] >= x) v.push_back(p[i]);
    for (int i = (0); i < int((int)v.size()); i++) {
        vector<int>::iterator it = upper_bound((sol).begin(), (sol).end(), v[i]);
        if (it == sol.end())
            sol.push_back(v[i]);
        else
            *it = v[i];
    }
    ans = max(ans, a + (t - 2 * n) * cnt[x] + (int)sol.size());
}

int main() {
    scanf("%d %d", &n, &t);
    for (int i = (0); i < int(n); i++) {
        scanf("%d", &p[i]);
        cnt[p[i]]++;
    }

    // Check for the condition where `t` is significantly larger than `2 * n`
    check_t_large_invariant(n, t);

    if (t <= 2 * n) {
        brut();
        return 0;
    }
    for (int i = (0); i < int(n); i++) fix(p[i]);
    printf("%d\n", ans);
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Checker Functions:** The checker functions are implemented to monitor conditions under which the program may experience performance bottlenecks. Each function emits a warning and aborts the program if the condition is met.

2. **Integration Points:**
   - **`check_t_large_invariant`:** This is placed after reading the input values of `n` and `t`, to detect if `t` is significantly large compared to `2 * n`.
   - **`check_vector_growth_invariant`:** This is called within the `fix()` function to check if the `v` vector grows beyond a reasonable size.
   - **`check_repeated_structures_invariant`:** This can be used to check more specific conditions about data structure usage inefficiencies, though its specific usage isn't detailed here.

This setup ensures that potential performance issues are flagged during execution, providing valuable information for optimization and debugging.
