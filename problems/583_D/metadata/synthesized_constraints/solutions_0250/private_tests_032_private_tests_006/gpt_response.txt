### Phase 1: Identifying Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Hit Count Comparison**: 
   - From the hit counts, we observe that the `solve_rev` function has significant hits during the slow run but none during the fast run. This implies that the program branches into a different path when `t >= 2 * n`.
   - Particularly, line 24 in `solve_rev` has a very high hit count (2,555,000) in the slow run, demonstrating that the inner loop is a bottleneck.

2. **Analysis of the Bottleneck**:
   - The line in question involves a nested loop: `for (int j = a[i]; j < MAXQ; j++)`, which suggests that for larger values of `a[i]`, this loop iterates more extensively.
   - The high hit count in `solve_rev` implies extensive computation when `n*n` elements are processed in reverse and suggests that the computation of the `dp` values in `solve_rev` is costly.

### Phase 2: Deriving Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **Invariant 1: Large `t` Combined with Large Input Values**:
   - Natural language: "When `t` is large enough to exceed `2 * n`, and the input values are towards the higher limit of their range, the program may execute a large number of operations, leading to a slowdown. This is particularly due to repeated evaluations in reverse order."
   - Explanation: This invariant captures the situation where the program operates on much larger datasets (`n*n` elements) and does complex operations due to large values in the array that trigger long loops in `solve_rev`.

2. **Invariant 2: Back-and-Forth Processing with High Repetition**:
   - Natural language: "If `t` is significantly larger than `2 * n`, causing repeated processing of elements both in regular and reverse order, this may lead to increased computational complexity."
   - Explanation: The slowdown results from processing the whole array multiple times in both forward and reverse order, effectively increasing the time complexity, especially for larger `t`.

3. **Invariant 3: Non-decreasing Sequence Construction with Large Arrays**:
   - Natural language: "Finding the longest non-decreasing sequence becomes computationally intensive when the initial array length `n` is large, and `t` results in the complete array being processed in reverse order."
   - Explanation: As the size `n` approaches its upper bound and `t` is large, the dynamic programming solution's complexity increases, particularly in reverse computation, leading to delays.

These performance-characterizing invariants help identify scenarios where the computation becomes disproportionately large relative to the input size constraints, providing a guideline for potential optimization or alerting when these circumstances arise.

### Phase 3: Implementing the Natural Language Invariants in C++

Based on the performance-characterizing invariants derived earlier, below are the C++ code snippets implementing those checks:

```cpp
// Checker for Invariant 1: Large `t` Combined with Large Input Values
void check_large_t_and_values_invariant(int t, int n, const int* a, int len) {
    bool largeValueFound = false;
    for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
        if (a[i] > 250) { // Arbitrary threshold for large value
            largeValueFound = true;
            break;
        }
    }
    if (t >= 2 * n && largeValueFound) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to large t and large input values!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Checker for Invariant 2: Back-and-Forth Processing with High Repetition
void check_back_and_forth_processing_invariant(int t, int n) {
    if (t > 2 * n) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to excessive back-and-forth processing!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Checker for Invariant 3: Non-decreasing Sequence Construction with Large Arrays
void check_large_array_invariant(int n, int t) {
    if (n >= 80 && t >= 2 * n) { // These are threshold values based on experience
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to large non-decreasing sequence computations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrating the Checkers into the Original Program

Below is the original C++ program instrumented with the above checkers:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

const int MAXN = 201;
const int MAXQ = 305;

int a[2 * MAXN * MAXN];
int dp[2 * MAXN * MAXN];
int cnt_ma[MAXQ], cnt_ma_rev[MAXQ];
int cnt[MAXQ];

void solve(int *a, int len, int *cnt_ma) {
    for (int i = 0; i < MAXQ; i++) cnt_ma[i] = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
        dp[i] = 0;
        for (int j = 0; j <= a[i]; j++) {
            dp[i] = max(dp[i], cnt_ma[j]);
        }
        dp[i]++;
        cnt_ma[a[i]] = dp[i];
    }
}

void solve_rev(int *a, int len, int *cnt_ma) {
    for (int i = 0; i < MAXQ; i++) cnt_ma[i] = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
        dp[i] = 0;
        for (int j = a[i]; j < MAXQ; j++) {
            dp[i] = max(dp[i], cnt_ma[j]);
        }
        dp[i]++;
        cnt_ma[a[i]] = dp[i];
    }
}

// Checker functions
void check_large_t_and_values_invariant(int t, int n, const int* a, int len);
void check_back_and_forth_processing_invariant(int t, int n);
void check_large_array_invariant(int n, int t);

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(0);
    
    int n, t;
    cin >> n >> t;
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        cin >> a[i];
        for (int j = 1; j < 2 * n; j++) a[i + n * j] = a[i];
        cnt[a[i]]++;
    }

    // Insert invariant checks after reading inputs
    check_large_t_and_values_invariant(t, n, a, n);
    check_back_and_forth_processing_invariant(t, n);
    check_large_array_invariant(n, t);

    if (t < 2 * n) {
        solve(a, t * n, cnt_ma);
        int ans = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            ans = max(ans, cnt_ma[a[i]]);
        }
        cout << ans << endl;
        return 0;
    }
    
    solve(a, n * n, cnt_ma);
    reverse(a, a + n * n);
    solve_rev(a, n * n, cnt_ma_rev);
    
    int ans = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        ans = max(ans, cnt_ma[a[i]] + cnt_ma_rev[a[i]] + (t - 2 * n) * cnt[a[i]]);
    }
    
    cout << ans << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

- The checkers are invoked right after reading the input values (`n`, `t`, and `a`), which ensures that potential performance issues are flagged before the heavy computation begins.
- Each checker targets specific conditions that were identified as potential performance bottlenecks, helping with early detection of problematic input scenarios.
