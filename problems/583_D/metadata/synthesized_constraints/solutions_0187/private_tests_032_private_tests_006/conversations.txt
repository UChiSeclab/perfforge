system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

You are given an array of positive integers a1, a2, ..., an × T of length n × T. We know that for any i > n it is true that ai = ai - n. Find the length of the longest non-decreasing sequence of the given array.

Input

The first line contains two space-separated integers: n, T (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ T ≤ 107). The second line contains n space-separated integers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 300).

Output

Print a single number — the length of a sought sequence.

Examples

Input

4 3
3 1 4 2


Output

5

Note

The array given in the sample looks like that: 3, 1, 4, 2, 3, 1, 4, 2, 3, 1, 4, 2. The elements in bold form the largest non-decreasing subsequence.

assistant: To diagnose the performance issue and derive performance-characterizing invariants, we follow these two main phases:

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Compare Line-Level Hit Counts:**  
   - The `binary` function (lines 19-24) receives significantly more hits on the slow input than on the fast input. In the slow input, lines 19 and 20 are hit 51,128,440 times compared to 93,831 times in the fast input.
   - The loop in the `lis` function (lines 41-55) also shows a large number of hits on the slow input at line 51, which calls the `binary` function.

2. **Pinpoint Lines or Functions with Significant Hits:**
   - The `binary` function is called extensively on the slow input.
   - Both `lis` and `lis2` functions are repeatedly invoked for the slow input, hitting line 51 (inside the loop) a large number of times.

3. **Infer Interaction with Data Structures/Loops/Recursion:**
   - The `binary` function's recursive calls are likely due to the `lis` and `lis2` functions trying to manage the sequence's ordered insertion within the loop.
   - Since the problem's constraints include `T` up to \(10^7\), the large number of recursions in `binary` for large `T` is a leading factor for the slowdown.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **Generate Natural Language Statements:**

    - **Invariant 1:**
      - "If the array sequence length becomes significantly large due to high `T` values, resulting in repeated calls to the `binary` function for ordered insertion, the execution time increases substantially."
    
    - **Invariant 2:**
      - "If the `lis` and `lis2` functions are called in a nested manner with high sequence length, and if `T` is large, the nested and recursive processing of the sequence elements through `binary` can degrade performance."

2. **Avoid Specific Numeric Values:**
   - These invariants do not specifically mention exact input values but rather conditions related to the structure and behavior of the execution path.

3. **Correlate Conditions to Input Patterns:**
   - The slowdown is primarily correlated with high values of `T` that cause extensive sequence manipulation and recursive calls within `binary` for insertion operations.

4. **Ensure Broad Applicability:**
   - These invariants are applicable to potential future inputs that could lead to similar performance degradation under high `T` constraints.

### Conclusive Statements

These performance invariants indicate that the slowdown is primarily triggered when the sequence operations become extensive, due to the repeated recursive processing of elements, particularly when `T` is large. To address such performance bottlenecks, strategies like optimizing the insertion logic or limiting recursion depth might be needed to prevent excessive computational overhead.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
You are given an array of positive integers a1, a2, ..., an × T of length n × T. We know that for any i > n it is true that ai = ai - n. Find the length of the longest non-decreasing sequence of the given array.

Input

The first line contains two space-separated integers: n, T (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ T ≤ 107). The second line contains n space-separated integers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 300).

Output

Print a single number — the length of a sought sequence.

Examples

Input

4 3
3 1 4 2


Output

5

Note

The array given in the sample looks like that: 3, 1, 4, 2, 3, 1, 4, 2, 3, 1, 4, 2. The elements in bold form the largest non-decreasing subsequence. 

Solution (C++ code):
{solution}


assistant: Let's start by translating the performance-characterizing invariants into C++ checker code, and then integrate them into the original program.

### Phase 3: Implement Natural Language Invariants in C++

1. **Invariant 1:**
   - "If the array sequence length becomes significantly large due to high `T` values, resulting in repeated calls to the `binary` function for ordered insertion, the execution time increases substantially."

    ```cpp
    void check_large_sequence_invariant(int seqSize, int T) {
        if (seqSize > 1000 && T > 1000) { // arbitrary threshold for large sequence
            cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large sequence due to high T value!" << endl;
            abort();
        }
    }
    ```

2. **Invariant 2:**
   - "If the `lis` and `lis2` functions are called in a nested manner with high sequence length, and if `T` is large, the nested and recursive processing of the sequence elements through `binary` can degrade performance."

    ```cpp
    void check_recursive_calls_invariant(int lisCalls, int lis2Calls, int T) {
        if (lisCalls > 100 && lis2Calls > 100 && T > 1000) { // arbitrary thresholds
            cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive recursive calls!" << endl;

### Notes on Code Integration:

- **`check_large_sequence_invariant`**: Added after setting up the sequence and before entering the loops that process it.
- **`check_recursive_calls_invariant`**: Added after the loops where `lis` and `lis2` are used, checking for potential excessive recursion calls.
- These checks help identify conditions leading to performance bottlenecks without significantly impacting the program's performance in typical scenarios.
