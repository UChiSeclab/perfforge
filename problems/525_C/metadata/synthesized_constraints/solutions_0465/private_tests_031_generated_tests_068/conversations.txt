system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

In the evening, after the contest Ilya was bored, and he really felt like maximizing. He remembered that he had a set of n sticks and an instrument. Each stick is characterized by its length li.

Ilya decided to make a rectangle from the sticks. And due to his whim, he decided to make rectangles in such a way that maximizes their total area. Each stick is used in making at most one rectangle, it is possible that some of sticks remain unused. Bending sticks is not allowed.

Sticks with lengths a1, a2, a3 and a4 can make a rectangle if the following properties are observed:

  * a1 ≤ a2 ≤ a3 ≤ a4
  * a1 = a2
  * a3 = a4



A rectangle can be made of sticks with lengths of, for example, 3 3 3 3 or 2 2 4 4. A rectangle cannot be made of, for example, sticks 5 5 5 7.

Ilya also has an instrument which can reduce the length of the sticks. The sticks are made of a special material, so the length of each stick can be reduced by at most one. For example, a stick with length 5 can either stay at this length or be transformed into a stick of length 4.

You have to answer the question — what maximum total area of the rectangles can Ilya get with a file if makes rectangles from the available sticks?

Input

The first line of the input contains a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of the available sticks.

The second line of the input contains n positive integers li (2 ≤ li ≤ 106) — the lengths of the sticks.

Output

The first line of the output must contain a single non-negative integer — the maximum total area of the rectangles that Ilya can make from the available sticks.

assistant: Based on the provided C code and the input data, I will analyze performance bottlenecks and derived performance-characterizing invariants.

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Line-Level Hit Count Analysis:**
   - Lines inside the loop starting at line 22 (`while (xx >= 0)`) show significantly higher hit counts for the slow input compared to the fast input.
   - Specifically, line 22 is executed 1000006 times in the slow case versus 11 times for the fast case. Similarly, lines 23 and 28 also show substantially more hits in the slow input.
   - This indicates that the loop from line 22 to line 46 is a hotspot, especially as it involves decrementing `xx` from `y` down to `0`.

2. **Data Structures and Control Flow:**
   - The loop at line 22 iterates over all possible stick lengths starting from the maximum length (`y`) down to 0. This suggests that the higher the maximum stick length, the greater the number of iterations, regardless of the number of sticks available.
   - The logic checks for pairs of sticks to form rectangles and updates counters (`w` and `ww`). The conditions depend heavily on the count of stick lengths (`a[xx]`), leading to multiple iterations when many sticks have the same length.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the analysis, here are potential performance-characterizing invariants that could explain when the code might enter a slower path:

1. **Invariant for High Maximum Stick Length:**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "When the maximum stick length (`y`) is large, the loop from the maximum length down to zero can cause significant slowdowns, especially if there are repeated lengths requiring many checks."
   - **Explanation:** The loop is directly influenced by the maximum length of the sticks, so if `y` is large, the loop will run many times, slowing down the program. This is especially problematic when many sticks are at this maximum length or near it, as it forces unnecessary checking and updating.

2. **Invariant for Large Count of Identical Lengths:**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "If there are many sticks of the same length, especially the maximum length, this can cause the loop to iterate excessively to pair and decrement sticks."
   - **Explanation:** The conditions inside the loop (lines 28-31 and 37-44) depend on the counts of sticks of certain lengths. When many sticks share the same length, particularly the max length, more operations are done to find pairs, thereby increasing execution time.

3. **Invariant for Imbalance in Stick Pairing:**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "If the distribution of stick lengths causes inefficient pairing, forcing the program to repeatedly check for pairs as the loop decrements, this can slow down the program."
   - **Explanation:** Inefficient pairing occurs when sticks are not readily available to form rectangles, requiring multiple attempts and checks to make potential pairs, leading to increased computation.

These invariants indicate that not just the size of the input but also the characteristics of the stick lengths (such as maximum length and distribution) significantly influence the performance. These insights can help identify future cases that might trigger slow execution paths.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
In the evening, after the contest Ilya was bored, and he really felt like maximizing. He remembered that he had a set of n sticks and an instrument. Each stick is characterized by its length li.

Ilya decided to make a rectangle from the sticks. And due to his whim, he decided to make rectangles in such a way that maximizes their total area. Each stick is used in making at most one rectangle, it is possible that some of sticks remain unused. Bending sticks is not allowed.

Sticks with lengths a1, a2, a3 and a4 can make a rectangle if the following properties are observed:

  * a1 ≤ a2 ≤ a3 ≤ a4
  * a1 = a2
  * a3 = a4



A rectangle can be made of sticks with lengths of, for example, 3 3 3 3 or 2 2 4 4. A rectangle cannot be made of, for example, sticks 5 5 5 7.

Ilya also has an instrument which can reduce the length of the sticks. The sticks are made of a special material, so the length of each stick can be reduced by at most one. For example, a stick with length 5 can either stay at this length or be transformed into a stick of length 4.

You have to answer the question — what maximum total area of the rectangles can Ilya get with a file if makes rectangles from the available sticks?

Input

The first line of the input contains a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of the available sticks.

The second line of the input contains n positive integers li (2 ≤ li ≤ 106) — the lengths of the sticks.

Output

The first line of the output must contain a single non-negative integer — the maximum total area of the rectangles that Ilya can make from the available sticks.

assistant: Let's implement the natural language invariants as runtime checks in C++.

### Phase 3: Implementing Invariants as Checker Functions

1. **Invariant for High Maximum Stick Length:**
   - This invariant checks if the maximum stick length is very large, which could cause slowdown.
   
   ```cpp
   void check_max_length_invariant(long long max_length) {
       if (max_length > 1000000) { // Threshold based on problem constraints
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck - maximum stick length is too large!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Invariant for Large Count of Identical Lengths:**
   - This check ensures that having many sticks of the same length doesn't trigger excessive operations.
   
   ```cpp
   void check_identical_lengths_invariant(const int* array, int size) {
       int threshold = 50000; // Arbitrary threshold for excessive same-length sticks
       for (int i = 0; i < size; ++i) {
           if (array[i] > threshold) {
               cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck - too many sticks of the same length!" << endl;
               abort();
           }
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Invariant for Imbalance in Stick Pairing:**
   - Ensure that there is not a significant imbalance in stick pairing possibilities.
   
   ```cpp
   void check_pairing_imbalance_invariant(int rect_count) {
       if (rect_count < 1) { // If not enough pairs are formed, it indicates imbalance
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck - imbalance in stick pairing!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Integrating Checkers into the Program

Now we will embed these checks into the original C++ program at appropriate places:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>

int a[1000002] = {0};

// Define checker functions here
void check_max_length_invariant(long long max_length) {
    if (max_length > 1000000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck - maximum stick length is too large!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_identical_lengths_invariant(const int* array, int size) {
    int threshold = 50000;
    for (int i = 0; i < size; ++i) {
        if (array[i] > threshold) {
            cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck - too many sticks of the same length!" << endl;
            abort();
        }
    }
}

void check_pairing_imbalance_invariant(int rect_count) {
    if (rect_count < 1) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck - imbalance in stick pairing!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    int m, n;
    int mm, nn;
    long long int w, ww, x, xx, y, yy, z, zz;
    
    // Read input
    scanf("%d", &nn);
    mm = 0;
    y = 0;
    
    while (mm < nn) {
        scanf("%lld", &x);
        if (x > y) {
            y = x;
        }
        a[x - 1]++;
        mm++;
    }
    
    // Check for maximum stick length invariant
    check_max_length_invariant(y);
    
    z = 0;
    w = 0;
    ww = 0;
    xx = y;
    
    // Check for identical lengths invariant
    check_identical_lengths_invariant(a, y + 1);
    
    while (xx >= 0) {
        if (w != 0 && ww != 0) {
            z = z + w * ww;
            w = 0;
            ww = 0;
        }
        if (a[xx] >= 2) {
            if (w == 0) {
                w = xx + 1;
                a[xx] = a[xx] - 2;
            } else if (ww == 0) {
                ww = xx + 1;
                a[xx] = a[xx] - 2;
            }
            continue;
        } else if (a[xx] == 1 && a[xx - 1] >= 1) {
            if (w == 0) {
                w = xx;
            } else if (ww == 0) {
                ww = xx;
            }
            a[xx] = a[xx] - 1;
            a[xx - 1] = a[xx - 1] - 1;
        }
        xx--;
    }
    
    // Check for pairing imbalance invariant
    int rect_count = (z > 0) ? 1 : 0; // An approximation of successful pairings
    check_pairing_imbalance_invariant(rect_count);
    
    printf("%lld\n", z);
    return 0;
}
```

### Comments on Checker Placement:
- The `check_max_length_invariant` is placed after the maximum stick length `y` is determined.
- The `check_identical_lengths_invariant` runs after the stick counts are populated.
- The `check_pairing_imbalance_invariant` is placed after the loop to ensure there was at least one valid rectangle formed.
