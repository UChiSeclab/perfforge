### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Comparison of Hit Counts**:
   - The `for` loops on lines 20 and 21 have significantly higher hit counts in the slow input compared to the fast input.
   - Line 20 (outer loop) is hit 2999 times for the slow input.
   - Line 21 (inner loop) is hit 8,217,518 times for the slow input.

2. **Pinpointing Inefficient Segments**:
   - The most critical line in terms of performance is line 21 (the inner loop), as its execution accounts for the majority of the hit count.
   - The conditional check on line 22 also has a high hit count, indicating it is evaluated frequently.

3. **Data Structure and Loop Interaction**:
   - Given the nature of the problem (grid-based operations), the loops are iterating over a reduced size of the matrix derived from initial dimensions `n` and `m` adjusted by `x`.
   - The hit count disparity suggests that the size reduction (via `n -= x * 2; m -= x * 2;`) doesn't sufficiently minimize the inner iterations in some cases.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **Natural Language Statements**:

   - **Invariant 1**: "When `n` or `m` is considerably larger after being reduced by twice the value of `x`, and both remain positive, the nested loops over the modified grid dimensions enter a slow execution path due to a high number of iterations."

   - **Invariant 2**: "If `x` is such that `n - 2x` and `m - 2x` are still large, the program will perform extensive iterations over a sizable sub-grid, leading to significant slowdowns."

2. **Thresholds and Conditions**:
   - The slowdown is likely when the effective dimensions (`n - 2x` and `m - 2x`) remain large, which means `x` is relatively smaller compared to `n/2` and `m/2`.
   - For values of `n` and `m` near the maximum constraint (5000), if `x` does not sufficiently reduce these dimensions, the slow path is triggered.

3. **General Observations**:
   - The problem complexity arises from needing to ensure corners are repainted correctly within the reduced grid.
   - Given the constraints, any condition where `n` and `m` dimensions after adjustments remain close to or above, for example, 1000 could be seen as a potential trigger for slow performance due to the extensive number of iterations.

These invariants help identify input patterns that can lead to performance bottlenecks, enabling a fuzzer or a developer to test and diagnose potential slow paths more effectively without relying on exact input values.

### Phase 3: Implementing Natural Language Invariants in C++

Below are the C++ code snippets that implement the performance-characterizing invariants derived earlier. These snippets use conditional checks to identify when the program may enter a slow execution path.

```cpp
void check_grid_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large effective grid size!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage of the function
check_grid_size_invariant(n > 2000 && m > 2000 && x < (min(n, m) / 2));
```

### Phase 4: Integrating the Checkers into the Original C++ Program

Here is the instrumented C++ code with the integrated performance checks:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
static const double EPS = 1e-8;
static const double PI = 4.0 * atan(1.0);
static const double PI2 = 8.0 * atan(1.0);

void check_grid_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large effective grid size!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    long long n, m, x;
    cin >> n >> m >> x;

    // Check for potential performance bottleneck due to large effective grid size
    check_grid_size_invariant(n > 2000 && m > 2000 && x < (min(n, m) / 2));

    if (n < m) {
        swap(n, m);
    }
    --x;
    n -= x * 2;
    m -= x * 2;
    if (n <= 0 || m <= 0) {
        cout << 0 << endl;
        return 0;
    }

    int answer = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < (int)n; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < (int)m; ++j) {
            if ((i + j) % 2 == 0 && (i == 0 || i == n - 1 || j == 0 || j == m - 1)) {
                ++answer;
            }
        }
    }
    cout << answer << endl;
}
```

### Explanation

- **Checker Function**: A function `check_grid_size_invariant` is implemented to check if the effective grid size post reduction is large, which can be a potential performance bottleneck.
- **Condition**: The condition checks if the dimensions `n` and `m` are both large after adjusting for `x`, suggesting that too many iterations may occur when `x` is relatively small.
- **Integration**: The checker function is called right after reading inputs and before modifying `n` and `m`, to avoid adding overhead in tight loops. This positioning ensures it captures the state before any potential performance-intensive operations commence.
