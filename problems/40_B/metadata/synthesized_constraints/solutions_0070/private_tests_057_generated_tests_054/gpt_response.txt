=== Invariants Response ===
To diagnose the performance bottleneck in the given C program, let's analyze the hit counts and the code logic.

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Analyzing Hit Counts**:
   - The loops on lines 14 and 15 are the most significant contributors to the number of operations. Specifically, line 15 has a hit count of 8,217,260 in the slow input case.
   - This indicates that the nested loops are being executed a very large number of times, which significantly contributes to the slowdown.

2. **Interaction with Input Constraints**:
   - The program reduces `n` and `m` by `2 * (x - 1)`. For large values of `x`, this can result in negative or zero dimensions, short-circuiting further calculations.
   - However, when `n` and `m` remain positive after this reduction, the loops iterate over almost the entire board size, which is computationally expensive.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the analysis, here are the performance-characterizing invariants for the program:

1. **Invariant on Loop Execution**:
   - **Natural Language Description**: "The program slows down significantly when the dimensions `n` and `m` remain large after accounting for the reduction by `2 * (x - 1)`, causing the nested loops to iterate over a large area of the chessboard."
   - **Threshold Consideration**: Since the original constraints are `1 ≤ n, m ≤ 5000`, a substantial slowdown happens when `n > 0` and `m > 0` after reduction, and they are still large enough to result in a high number of loop iterations, such as when they are close to 5000.

2. **Invariant on Boundary Conditions**:
   - **Natural Language Description**: "A slowdown is observed when the condition `(i == 0 || j == 0 || i == m - 1 || j == n - 1)` frequently evaluates to true in a large chessboard after reduction, leading to excessive checks and increments in the innermost loop."
   - **Threshold Consideration**: This condition becomes impactful when both `n` and `m` are reduced but still large, causing many iterations over the boundary cells.

3. **Invariant on Reduction Impact**:
   - **Natural Language Description**: "If the reduction `2 * (x - 1)` results in `n` and `m` being positive but significantly reduced from their initial size, while still allowing for many iterations, the program may still perform a large number of operations."
   - **Threshold Consideration**: This situation typically arises when `x` is large but not large enough to make `n` or `m` zero or negative, keeping loops active over a considerable grid area.

These invariants capture the essence of performance issues by characterizing the conditions that lead to excessive loop iterations, especially when `n` and `m` are not reduced enough to avoid the nested loops entirely while still remaining substantial in size.

### Phase 3: Implementing the Invariants as Checker Code in C++

Based on the performance-characterizing invariants derived earlier, here are the C++ checkers:

1. **Invariant on Loop Execution**:
   - **Checker Code**:
   ```cpp
   // Check if n and m remain large after reduction
   void check_loop_invariant(int n, int m) {
       if (n > 100 && m > 100) {  // Assuming a threshold for large values after reduction
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large loops!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Invariant on Boundary Conditions**:
   - **Checker Code**:
   ```cpp
   // Check if n and m allow frequent boundary checks
   void check_boundary_invariant(int n, int m, int x) {
       if ((n > 20 || m > 20) && x > 1) {  // Thresholds where boundary conditions frequently hit
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive boundary checks!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Invariant on Reduction Impact**:
   - **Checker Code**:
   ```cpp
   // Check if dimensions remain substantial after reduction
   void check_reduction_invariant(int n, int m) {
       if (n > 0 && m > 0 && n * m > 10000) {  // Condition where reduced dimensions still cause heavy computation
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large computation area after reduction!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Integrating Checker Code with the Original Program

Now, let's integrate the above checkers into the original C++ solution:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Check if n and m remain large after reduction
void check_loop_invariant(int n, int m) {
    if (n > 100 && m > 100) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large loops!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Check if n and m allow frequent boundary checks
void check_boundary_invariant(int n, int m, int x) {
    if ((n > 20 || m > 20) && x > 1) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive boundary checks!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Check if dimensions remain substantial after reduction
void check_reduction_invariant(int n, int m) {
    if (n > 0 && m > 0 && n * m > 10000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large computation area after reduction!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    cout << fixed;
    cout.precision(9);
    int n, m, x;
    cin >> n >> m >> x;

    // Checkers before computation
    check_loop_invariant(n, m);
    check_boundary_invariant(n, m, x);

    n -= 2 * (x - 1);
    m -= 2 * (x - 1);

    // Additional check after reduction
    check_reduction_invariant(n, m);

    if (n <= 0 || m <= 0) {
        cout << 0 << "\n";
    } else {
        int r = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++)
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++)
                if (i == 0 || j == 0 || i == m - 1 || j == n - 1) {
                    if ((i + j) % 2 == 0) {
                        r++;
                    }
                }
        cout << r << "\n";
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

- **Placement of Checks**: The checks are strategically placed just after reading inputs and before the main computation. This ensures that potential bottlenecks are detected early without adding extra overhead during the loop execution itself.
- **Thresholds**: The thresholds for the checks are set to capture conditions where `n` and `m` remain significantly large after reduction, leading to extensive computations, as inferred from the problem constraints and observed slow inputs.
