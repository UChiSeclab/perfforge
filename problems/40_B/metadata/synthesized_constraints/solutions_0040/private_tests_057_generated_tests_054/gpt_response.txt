=== Invariants Response ===
To diagnose the performance bottleneck in the given C program, we must first compare the line-level hit counts from the fast and slow inputs and then derive performance-characterizing invariants in natural language. Here's the analysis and the invariants:

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Hit Count Discrepancies**:
   - Lines 7 and 10 (the inner loops) have notably higher hit counts in the slow input compared to the fast input. This indicates that these loops are being executed a significantly larger number of times for the slow input.
   - The operations in the inner loops (lines 8 and 11) involve conditional checks that cause `ans` to be updated. The hit counts for these lines are also substantially higher for the slow input.

2. **Interaction with Data Structures and Input Constraints**:
   - The loops iterate over `i` from `0` to `n - 2 * x + 2` and `j` from `0` to `m - 2 * x + 2`. Similarly, for the second loop, `i` from `0` to `n - 2 * (x + 1) + 2` and `j` from `0` to `m - 2 * (x + 1) + 2`.
   - Given that `x` is a large number relative to `m` in the slow input, this results in a large number of iterations over the `j` loop, causing the slowdown.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on these observations, here are the performance-characterizing invariants:

1. **Invariant for Large Width `m` Relative to `x`**:
   - **Natural Language Description**: "If the width `m` of the board is significantly larger than `2 * x`, the program may experience a slowdown due to excessive iterations over wide board sections."
   - **Explanation**: This is because the inner loop iterates over a range that decreases with increasing `x`, but when `m` is large enough not to be constrained much by `x`, the number of iterations becomes excessive.

2. **Invariant for Large Values of `x`**:
   - **Natural Language Description**: "If `x` is large and close to half of `n` or `m`, it can cause extensive looping and recalculations, leading to performance degradation."
   - **Explanation**: This is due to the fact that the range `(n - 2 * x + 2)` or `(m - 2 * x + 2)` can still be large, resulting in many unnecessary calculations, especially if `n` and `m` are originally much larger than `x`.

3. **Invariant Related to Board Dimensions**:
   - **Natural Language Description**: "When the board dimensions `n` and `m` are large, combined with a large `x`, the nested loops may execute a substantial number of times, causing a slowdown."
   - **Explanation**: This is because both dimensions of the board significantly contribute to the number of iterations required by the nested loops, particularly if both `n` and `m` are not sufficiently reduced by the `x` factor.

These invariants provide a framework for understanding slow execution paths given the constraints of the problem (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 5000 and 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9). They highlight scenarios where the combination of board dimensions and the repainting parameter `x` can lead to inefficient execution due to extensive looping.

=== Checker Response ===
## Phase 3: Implement Performance-Characterizing Invariants in C++

Here are the C++ code snippets to check the conditions derived from the performance-characterizing invariants:

1. **Invariant for Large Width `m` Relative to `x`**:
   ```cpp
   void check_large_width_invariant(int m, int x) {
       if (m > 2 * x) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - width m significantly larger than 2*x!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Invariant for Large Values of `x`**:
   ```cpp
   void check_large_x_invariant(int n, int m, int x) {
       if (x > (n / 2) || x > (m / 2)) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - x is large relative to n or m!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Invariant Related to Board Dimensions**:
   ```cpp
   void check_large_dimensions_invariant(int n, int m, int x) {
       if ((n > 2000 && m > 2000) && x > 500) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large board dimensions with large x!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

## Phase 4: Integrate Checks into the Original C++ Program

Let's integrate these checks into the original C++ program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Checker functions for performance invariants

void check_large_width_invariant(int m, int x) {
    if (m > 2 * x) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - width m significantly larger than 2*x!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_large_x_invariant(int n, int m, int x) {
    if (x > (n / 2) || x > (m / 2)) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - x is large relative to n or m!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_large_dimensions_invariant(int n, int m, int x) {
    if ((n > 2000 && m > 2000) && x > 500) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large board dimensions with large x!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    int n, m, x, ans = 0;
    cin >> n >> m >> x;
    
    // Insert performance checkers at effective points after reading inputs
    check_large_width_invariant(m, x);        // Check if m is significantly larger than 2*x
    check_large_x_invariant(n, m, x);         // Check if x is large relative to n or m
    check_large_dimensions_invariant(n, m, x); // Check for large dimensions with large x
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n - 2 * x + 2; i++)
        for (int j = 0; j < m - 2 * x + 2; j++)
            if (i % 2 == j % 2) ans++;
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n - 2 * (x + 1) + 2; i++)
        for (int j = 0; j < m - 2 * (x + 1) + 2; j++)
            if (i % 2 == j % 2) ans--;
    
    cout << ans;
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

- **Checker Placement**: The performance checks are placed immediately after reading the inputs. This ensures that they do not add overhead inside the loops.
- **Checker Functions**: Each check is implemented as a separate function to keep the main function clean and make each check reusable.
- **Abort on Trigger**: Each checker outputs an error message and aborts the program if the condition is triggered, aiding in quick identification of potential performance issues.
