system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

Giant chess is quite common in Geraldion. We will not delve into the rules of the game, we'll just say that the game takes place on an h × w field, and it is painted in two colors, but not like in chess. Almost all cells of the field are white and only some of them are black. Currently Gerald is finishing a game of giant chess against his friend Pollard. Gerald has almost won, and the only thing he needs to win is to bring the pawn from the upper left corner of the board, where it is now standing, to the lower right corner. Gerald is so confident of victory that he became interested, in how many ways can he win?

The pawn, which Gerald has got left can go in two ways: one cell down or one cell to the right. In addition, it can not go to the black cells, otherwise the Gerald still loses. There are no other pawns or pieces left on the field, so that, according to the rules of giant chess Gerald moves his pawn until the game is over, and Pollard is just watching this process.

Input

The first line of the input contains three integers: h, w, n — the sides of the board and the number of black cells (1 ≤ h, w ≤ 105, 1 ≤ n ≤ 2000). 

Next n lines contain the description of black cells. The i-th of these lines contains numbers ri, ci (1 ≤ ri ≤ h, 1 ≤ ci ≤ w) — the number of the row and column of the i-th cell.

It is guaranteed that the upper left and lower right cell are white and all cells in the description are distinct.

Output

Print a single line — the remainder of the number of ways to move Gerald's pawn from the upper left to the lower right corner modulo 109 + 7.

assistant: ### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

Based on the provided hit counts, the primary sections of the code that are contributing to the slowdown in the slow input are:

1. **Function `fpm`:** 
   - **Lines 6–13:** This function is invoked multiple times with a high number of iterations due to its exponentiation by squaring method. It is called primarily within the `init` function for computing modular inverses of factorials.
   - **Hit Counts:** 400,000 calls with 12,400,000 loops on the slow input compared to 4,000 calls with 124,000 loops on the fast input.

2. **Loop Inside `init` Function:**
   - **Lines 27–29:** The loop iterates `h + w` times (200,000 iterations for the slow input vs 2,000 for the fast input). The use of `fpm` within this loop amplifies the computational demand further.

3. **Combination Calculations:**
   - **Lines 44, 46, 50, 56:** The combination function `c` is calculated several times. Given the nature of the problem, these calculations depend on the values of `h`, `w`, and the positions of the black cells, which increase with the board size.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the analysis, we can derive the following performance invariants explaining conditions under which the program slows down:

1. **Invariant 1: Large Board Size for Factorial Calculations**
   - Natural Language Description: "When the combined dimensions of the board (`h` + `w`) are large, the program will perform numerous calculations involving large factorials and modular inverses, leading to significant computational overhead."
   - Applicable Threshold: Since both `h` and `w` can go up to \(10^5\), this calculation becomes intensive when both dimensions are significantly large. A threshold could be when `h + w` approaches the upper limits, such as \( \geq 10^5\).

2. **Invariant 2: Frequent Modular Exponentiation**
   - Natural Language Description: "Repeated modular exponentiation operations within the initialization phase become a bottleneck when computing inverses for large factorials due to the high computational complexity involved."
   - Applicable Threshold: The bottleneck is particularly pronounced when the number of iterations in `init` is high, approximately when `h + w` leads to >200,000 operations.

3. **Invariant 3: Dense Black Cell Configuration**
   - Natural Language Description: "A configuration of black cells that creates multiple potential paths requires recalculating paths frequently, causing the dynamic programming solution to recompute pathways multiple times."
   - Applicable Conditions: When black cells are positioned such that they significantly increase the complexity of valid paths (e.g., clustering around midpoints of the board), this scenario can cause performance degradation.

These invariants focus on the size of the board and the configuration of the black cells, which are the primary factors influencing the performance in this problem scenario.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
Giant chess is quite common in Geraldion. We will not delve into the rules of the game, we'll just say that the game takes place on an h × w field, and it is painted in two colors, but not like in chess. Almost all cells of the field are white and only some of them are black. Currently Gerald is finishing a game of giant chess against his friend Pollard. Gerald has almost won, and the only thing he needs to win is to bring the pawn from the upper left corner of the board, where it is now standing, to the lower right corner. Gerald is so confident of victory that he became interested, in how many ways can he win?

The pawn, which Gerald has got left can go in two ways: one cell down or one cell to the right. In addition, it can not go to the black cells, otherwise the Gerald still loses. There are no other pawns or pieces left on the field, so that, according to the rules of giant chess Gerald moves his pawn until the game is over, and Pollard is just watching this process.

Input

The first line of the input contains three integers: h, w, n — the sides of the board and the number of black cells (1 ≤ h, w ≤ 105, 1 ≤ n ≤ 2000). 

Next n lines contain the description of black cells. The i-th of these lines contains numbers ri, ci (1 ≤ ri ≤ h, 1 ≤ ci ≤ w) — the number of the row and column of the i-th cell.

It is guaranteed that the upper left and lower right cell are white and all cells in the description are distinct.

Output

Print a single line — the remainder of the number of ways to move Gerald's pawn from the upper left to the lower right corner modulo 109 + 7.

assistant: ### Phase 3: Implement Performance Invariants as C++ Checkers

Here, I'll translate the performance-characterizing invariants derived earlier into C++ code snippets for runtime checks.

```cpp
// Invariant 1: Large Board Size for Factorial Calculations
void check_large_board_size_invariant(long long h, long long w) {
    if (h + w > 200000) {  // Threshold chosen based on large input size considerations
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large board size!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Invariant 2: Frequent Modular Exponentiation
void check_modular_exponentiation_invariant(long long h, long long w) {
    if ((h + w) > 200000) {  // High iterations due to large factorial inversions
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive modular exponentiation!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Invariant 3: Dense Black Cell Configuration
void check_black_cells_invariant(int n) {
    if (n > 1000 && n < 2000) {  // Checking for dense configurations affecting path calculations
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - dense black cell configuration!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrate Checkers into the Original Program

Now, we'll insert these checkers into the original program at appropriate points to monitor for performance bottlenecks.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
const int maxn = 1e5 + 5;
const long long mod = 1e9 + 7;
long long inv[maxn * 2], fac[maxn * 2], n, h, w, dp[maxn];

long long fpm(long long a, long long p) {
    long long res = 1;
    while (p) {
        if (p & 1) res = res * a % mod;
        a = a * a % mod;
        p /= 2;
    }
    return res;
}

struct node {
    long long x, y;
};

bool cmp(node a1, node b1) {
    if (a1.x == b1.x) {
        return a1.y < b1.y;
    } else
        return a1.x < b1.x;
}

node a[maxn];

void init() {
    inv[0] = fac[0] = 1;
    for (int i = 1; i <= h + w; i++) {
        fac[i] = fac[i - 1] * i % mod;
        inv[i] = fpm(fac[i], mod - 2);
    }
}

long long c(long long n, long long m) {
    if (n < m || n < 0 || m < 0) return 0;
    return fac[n] * inv[n - m] % mod * inv[m] % mod;
}

// Performance Invariant Checkers
void check_large_board_size_invariant(long long h, long long w) {
    if (h + w > 200000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large board size!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_modular_exponentiation_invariant(long long h, long long w) {
    if ((h + w) > 200000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive modular exponentiation!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_black_cells_invariant(int n) {
    if (n > 1000 && n < 2000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - dense black cell configuration!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    cin >> h >> w >> n;
    
    // Insert performance checks after input
    check_large_board_size_invariant(h, w);
    check_modular_exponentiation_invariant(h, w);
    check_black_cells_invariant(n);
    
    init();
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        scanf("%lld%lld", &a[i].x, &a[i].y);
    }
    init();
    sort(a + 1, a + n + 1, cmp);
    long long ans = c(h + w - 1 - 1, h - 1);
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        dp[i] = c(a[i].x - 1 + a[i].y - 1, a[i].x - 1);
        for (int j = 1; j <= i - 1; j++) {
            if (a[j].x <= a[i].x && a[j].y <= a[i].y) {
                dp[i] = (dp[i] -
                         dp[j] * c(a[i].x + a[i].y - a[j].x - a[j].y, a[i].x - a[j].x) %
                             mod +
                         mod) %
                        mod;
            }
        }
        ans = (ans - dp[i] * c(h - a[i].x + w - a[i].y, h - a[i].x) % mod + mod) %
              mod;
    }
    cout << ans << endl;
}
```

### Explanation:

- **Location of Checks:** I placed the invariant checks immediately after reading the input values. This allows us to detect potential performance issues before entering the main computation sections of the program, such as initialization and combination calculations.
- **Checker Logic:** Each check relates directly to one of the identified performance bottlenecks. They ensure that if the conditions indicative of potential slow execution are met, a warning is printed and execution is aborted to prevent unnecessary performance degradation during testing or fuzzing.
