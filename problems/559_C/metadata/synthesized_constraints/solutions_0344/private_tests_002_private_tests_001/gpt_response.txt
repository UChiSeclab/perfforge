### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

Based on the provided hit counts, the primary sections of the code that are contributing to the slowdown in the slow input are:

1. **Function `fpm`:** 
   - **Lines 6–13:** This function is invoked multiple times with a high number of iterations due to its exponentiation by squaring method. It is called primarily within the `init` function for computing modular inverses of factorials.
   - **Hit Counts:** 400,000 calls with 12,400,000 loops on the slow input compared to 4,000 calls with 124,000 loops on the fast input.

2. **Loop Inside `init` Function:**
   - **Lines 27–29:** The loop iterates `h + w` times (200,000 iterations for the slow input vs 2,000 for the fast input). The use of `fpm` within this loop amplifies the computational demand further.

3. **Combination Calculations:**
   - **Lines 44, 46, 50, 56:** The combination function `c` is calculated several times. Given the nature of the problem, these calculations depend on the values of `h`, `w`, and the positions of the black cells, which increase with the board size.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the analysis, we can derive the following performance invariants explaining conditions under which the program slows down:

1. **Invariant 1: Large Board Size for Factorial Calculations**
   - Natural Language Description: "When the combined dimensions of the board (`h` + `w`) are large, the program will perform numerous calculations involving large factorials and modular inverses, leading to significant computational overhead."
   - Applicable Threshold: Since both `h` and `w` can go up to \(10^5\), this calculation becomes intensive when both dimensions are significantly large. A threshold could be when `h + w` approaches the upper limits, such as \( \geq 10^5\).

2. **Invariant 2: Frequent Modular Exponentiation**
   - Natural Language Description: "Repeated modular exponentiation operations within the initialization phase become a bottleneck when computing inverses for large factorials due to the high computational complexity involved."
   - Applicable Threshold: The bottleneck is particularly pronounced when the number of iterations in `init` is high, approximately when `h + w` leads to >200,000 operations.

3. **Invariant 3: Dense Black Cell Configuration**
   - Natural Language Description: "A configuration of black cells that creates multiple potential paths requires recalculating paths frequently, causing the dynamic programming solution to recompute pathways multiple times."
   - Applicable Conditions: When black cells are positioned such that they significantly increase the complexity of valid paths (e.g., clustering around midpoints of the board), this scenario can cause performance degradation.

These invariants focus on the size of the board and the configuration of the black cells, which are the primary factors influencing the performance in this problem scenario.

=== Checker Response ===
### Phase 3: Implement Performance Invariants as C++ Checkers

Here, I'll translate the performance-characterizing invariants derived earlier into C++ code snippets for runtime checks.

```cpp
// Invariant 1: Large Board Size for Factorial Calculations
void check_large_board_size_invariant(long long h, long long w) {
    if (h + w > 200000) {  // Threshold chosen based on large input size considerations
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large board size!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Invariant 2: Frequent Modular Exponentiation
void check_modular_exponentiation_invariant(long long h, long long w) {
    if ((h + w) > 200000) {  // High iterations due to large factorial inversions
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive modular exponentiation!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Invariant 3: Dense Black Cell Configuration
void check_black_cells_invariant(int n) {
    if (n > 1000 && n < 2000) {  // Checking for dense configurations affecting path calculations
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - dense black cell configuration!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrate Checkers into the Original Program

Now, we'll insert these checkers into the original program at appropriate points to monitor for performance bottlenecks.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
const int maxn = 1e5 + 5;
const long long mod = 1e9 + 7;
long long inv[maxn * 2], fac[maxn * 2], n, h, w, dp[maxn];

long long fpm(long long a, long long p) {
    long long res = 1;
    while (p) {
        if (p & 1) res = res * a % mod;
        a = a * a % mod;
        p /= 2;
    }
    return res;
}

struct node {
    long long x, y;
};

bool cmp(node a1, node b1) {
    if (a1.x == b1.x) {
        return a1.y < b1.y;
    } else
        return a1.x < b1.x;
}

node a[maxn];

void init() {
    inv[0] = fac[0] = 1;
    for (int i = 1; i <= h + w; i++) {
        fac[i] = fac[i - 1] * i % mod;
        inv[i] = fpm(fac[i], mod - 2);
    }
}

long long c(long long n, long long m) {
    if (n < m || n < 0 || m < 0) return 0;
    return fac[n] * inv[n - m] % mod * inv[m] % mod;
}

// Performance Invariant Checkers
void check_large_board_size_invariant(long long h, long long w) {
    if (h + w > 200000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large board size!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_modular_exponentiation_invariant(long long h, long long w) {
    if ((h + w) > 200000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive modular exponentiation!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_black_cells_invariant(int n) {
    if (n > 1000 && n < 2000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - dense black cell configuration!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    cin >> h >> w >> n;
    
    // Insert performance checks after input
    check_large_board_size_invariant(h, w);
    check_modular_exponentiation_invariant(h, w);
    check_black_cells_invariant(n);
    
    init();
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        scanf("%lld%lld", &a[i].x, &a[i].y);
    }
    init();
    sort(a + 1, a + n + 1, cmp);
    long long ans = c(h + w - 1 - 1, h - 1);
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        dp[i] = c(a[i].x - 1 + a[i].y - 1, a[i].x - 1);
        for (int j = 1; j <= i - 1; j++) {
            if (a[j].x <= a[i].x && a[j].y <= a[i].y) {
                dp[i] = (dp[i] -
                         dp[j] * c(a[i].x + a[i].y - a[j].x - a[j].y, a[i].x - a[j].x) %
                             mod +
                         mod) %
                        mod;
            }
        }
        ans = (ans - dp[i] * c(h - a[i].x + w - a[i].y, h - a[i].x) % mod + mod) %
              mod;
    }
    cout << ans << endl;
}
```

### Explanation:

- **Location of Checks:** I placed the invariant checks immediately after reading the input values. This allows us to detect potential performance issues before entering the main computation sections of the program, such as initialization and combination calculations.
- **Checker Logic:** Each check relates directly to one of the identified performance bottlenecks. They ensure that if the conditions indicative of potential slow execution are met, a warning is printed and execution is aborted to prevent unnecessary performance degradation during testing or fuzzing.
