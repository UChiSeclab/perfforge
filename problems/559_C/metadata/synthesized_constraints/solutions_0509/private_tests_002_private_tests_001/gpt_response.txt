=== Invariants Response ===
Based on the information provided, let's analyze the code and generate performance-characterizing invariants.

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Line-level Hit Counts Comparison:**

   - The function `pv()` (lines 7-12) is called significantly more often in the slow input compared to the fast input. Specifically, line 9 (`long long r = pv(a, b / 2);`) has a hit count of 6,000,030 for the slow input and only 60,030 for the fast input. This indicates that recursive power calculation is a major performance bottleneck, especially when `X` and `Y` are large.

   - The loops on lines 21 and 22 that populate `fu` and `inv` arrays are executed many more times for the slow input, with hit counts of 200,001 and 200,002 compared to 2,001 and 2,002 for the fast input. This implies that as the board dimensions `h` and `w` increase, the factorial and inverse factorial calculations become more expensive.

2. **Potential Inefficiencies:**

   - The `pv()` function is recursively calculating powers using a divide-and-conquer approach, which is optimal for large exponents but can become costly if called many times.
   
   - The outer loops depend heavily on `X` and `Y`, which means that for larger dimensions, factorial calculations (`fu` and `inv`) become a significant source of overhead.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the analysis, we can derive the following natural language performance invariants:

1. **Large Dimension Invariant:**
   - **Description:** "If the board dimensions `h` and `w` are large, the factorial and inverse calculations grow increasingly expensive. Performance degradation is likely when `h + w` approaches or exceeds `2 * 10^5`."
   - **Rationale:** The hit count data shows a significant increase in the number of times the loops for calculating `fu` and `inv` are executed, leading to higher execution time.

2. **Power Calculation Invariant:**
   - **Description:** "The recursive power function `pv` becomes a bottleneck when it is called repeatedly with large exponents. Performance issues arise when it is leveraged to compute inverse factorials for large board configurations."
   - **Rationale:** The disproportionate hit count for the `pv()` function indicates that repeated recursive calls for large exponents contribute significantly to the slowdown.

3. **Black Cell Path Complexity Invariant:**
   - **Description:** "When the distribution of black cells causes the path computation to involve numerous blocked paths, the dynamic programming state transitions significantly increase, leading to slower computation."
   - **Rationale:** The dynamic programming approach relies heavily on the number of valid paths and transitions; thus, complex configurations with many blocked paths (black cells) can lead to increased computations.

These invariants abstractly capture scenarios that can lead to performance issues, based on the structure of the code and observed hit counts. They go beyond the specific slow input provided and describe broader conditions that could lead to similar slowdowns in other inputs.

### Phase 3: Implement the Natural Language Invariants in C++

Here, we translate the natural language invariants into C++ runtime checks:

1. **Large Dimension Invariant:**
   ```cpp
   void check_large_dimension_invariant(int h, int w) {
       if (h + w > 200000) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered! Large board dimensions." << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Power Calculation Invariant:**
   ```cpp
   void check_power_calculation_invariant(int h, int w) {
       if (h > 50000 || w > 50000) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered! Power calculation in large configuration." << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Black Cell Path Complexity Invariant:**
   ```cpp
   void check_black_cell_path_complexity(int n) {
       if (n > 1000) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered! Complex black cell configuration." << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Integrate the Checker Code into the Original Program

Now, let's integrate these checks into the given C++ program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int dp[2222][2];
int X, Y, n;
int x[2222], y[2222];
int inv[211111], fu[211111];

int pv(int a, int b) {
    if (b == 0) return 1;
    long long r = pv(a, b / 2);
    r = r * r % 1000000007;
    if (b % 2) r = r * a % 1000000007;
    return r;
}

int C(int n, int k) {
    return fu[n] * 1ll * inv[k] % 1000000007 * inv[n - k] % 1000000007;
}

// Check for large dimensions
void check_large_dimension_invariant(int h, int w) {
    if (h + w > 200000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered! Large board dimensions." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Check for power calculation bottleneck
void check_power_calculation_invariant(int h, int w) {
    if (h > 50000 || w > 50000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered! Power calculation in large configuration." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Check for complex black cell configuration
void check_black_cell_path_complexity(int n) {
    if (n > 1000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered! Complex black cell configuration." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    cin >> X >> Y >> n;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) cin >> x[i] >> y[i];
    
    // Insert checks based on natural language invariants
    check_large_dimension_invariant(X, Y); // Detects large board dimensions
    check_power_calculation_invariant(X, Y); // Detects large configuration for power calculations
    check_black_cell_path_complexity(n); // Detects complex black cell configuration

    fu[0] = 1;
    for (int i = 1; i <= X + Y; i++) fu[i] = fu[i - 1] * 1ll * i % 1000000007;
    for (int i = 0; i <= X + Y; i++) inv[i] = pv(fu[i], 1000000007 - 2);
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++)
            if (x[i] + y[i] > x[j] + y[j]) {
                swap(x[i], x[j]);
                swap(y[i], y[j]);
            }

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) dp[i][1] = C(x[i] - 1 + y[i] - 1, x[i] - 1);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        for (int o = 0; o < 2; o++)
            for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
                if (x[j] < x[i] || y[j] < y[i]) continue;
                dp[j][o ^ 1] =
                    (dp[j][o ^ 1] +
                     dp[i][o] * 1ll * C(x[j] - x[i] + y[j] - y[i], x[j] - x[i])) %
                    1000000007;
            }

    int ans = C(X - 1 + Y - 1, X - 1);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        for (int o = 0; o < 2; o++) {
            int t = dp[i][o] * 1ll * C(X - x[i] + Y - y[i], X - x[i]) % 1000000007;
            if (o)
                ans = (ans - t + 1000000007) % 1000000007;
            else
                ans = (ans + t) % 1000000007;
        }
    
    cout << ans << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation of Integration:**
- **`check_large_dimension_invariant`**: This check is placed after reading input values `X` and `Y`, ensuring that we flag large board dimensions early.
- **`check_power_calculation_invariant`**: Also placed after input reading to detect potential power calculation bottlenecks for large `X` or `Y`.
- **`check_black_cell_path_complexity`**: Placed after reading `n` to ensure we detect complex black cell configurations that might slow down execution.

The checks are designed to trigger before entering the main computation parts of the program to help diagnose potential slowdowns effectively.
