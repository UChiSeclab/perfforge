system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

Giant chess is quite common in Geraldion. We will not delve into the rules of the game, we'll just say that the game takes place on an h × w field, and it is painted in two colors, but not like in chess. Almost all cells of the field are white and only some of them are black. Currently Gerald is finishing a game of giant chess against his friend Pollard. Gerald has almost won, and the only thing he needs to win is to bring the pawn from the upper left corner of the board, where it is now standing, to the lower right corner. Gerald is so confident of victory that he became interested, in how many ways can he win?

The pawn, which Gerald has got left can go in two ways: one cell down or one cell to the right. In addition, it can not go to the black cells, otherwise the Gerald still loses. There are no other pawns or pieces left on the field, so that, according to the rules of giant chess Gerald moves his pawn until the game is over, and Pollard is just watching this process.

Input

The first line of the input contains three integers: h, w, n — the sides of the board and the number of black cells (1 ≤ h, w ≤ 105, 1 ≤ n ≤ 2000). 

Next n lines contain the description of black cells. The i-th of these lines contains numbers ri, ci (1 ≤ ri ≤ h, 1 ≤ ci ≤ w) — the number of the row and column of the i-th cell.

It is guaranteed that the upper left and lower right cell are white and all cells in the description are distinct.

Output

Print a single line — the remainder of the number of ways to move Gerald's pawn from the upper left to the lower right corner modulo 109 + 7.

assistant: To diagnose the performance bottlenecks in the given C program and derive performance-characterizing invariants, we will analyze the hit count information and the code structure. 

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Line-Level Hit Count Comparison:**
   - **ModPow Function (Lines 5-9):** This recursive function has significantly higher hit counts for the slow input, indicating frequent recursive calls. The slow input has 9,000,270 hits versus 90,270 for the fast input.
   - **Factorial and Inverse Initialization (Lines 25-29):** The loop iterating from 1 to `h + w + 7` has 200,007 hits for the slow input versus 2,007 hits for the fast input, showing high computational overhead.

2. **Pinpoint Potential Bottlenecks:**
   - **Factorial and Inverse Calculation:** The loop from line 25 populates large arrays `fact` and `inv`, crucial for combinatorial calculations. Larger dimensions (`h` and `w`) exacerbate this overhead.
   - **Recursive ModPow Function:** The recursive nature of the function suggests that large exponents increase recursive depth, impacting performance.

3. **Interaction with Data Structures and Loops:**
   - The `fact` and `inv` arrays interact heavily with the `comb` function. The cost of initializing these arrays depends on the sum of `h` and `w`.
   - The nested loops on lines 38-46 utilize these arrays for combinatorial calculations, further exacerbating performance issues when `h` and `w` are large.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the analysis, we propose the following natural language performance invariants:

1. **Array Initialization Overhead:**
   - **Invariant:** "If the sum of the board dimensions `h + w` is large, the initialization of factorial and inverse arrays becomes a bottleneck due to extensive computations."
   - **Explanation:** When `h + w` approaches 200,000 or more, the loops for initializing these arrays incur significant computational cost.

2. **Recursive Exponentiation:**
   - **Invariant:** "If the recursive exponentiation function is called with large arguments, it may significantly degrade performance due to deep recursive calls."
   - **Explanation:** The `ModPow` function's depth increases with larger arguments, leading to excessive recursive calls.

3. **Combinatorial Calculations:**
   - **Invariant:** "When combinatorial functions are invoked with large indices, the repeated multiplication and modulo operations can become computationally expensive."
   - **Explanation:** The combinatorial function heavily relies on precomputed factorials and inverses, which are costly for large indices.

### Conclusion

The main performance bottlenecks are tied to computationally expensive operations that scale poorly with increasing board dimensions (`h` and `w`). The recursive `ModPow` function and large array initializations are critical areas where performance degradation occurs. These insights allow us to understand and predict potential slowdowns in similar input scenarios, guiding future optimizations or redesigns to handle large inputs more efficiently.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
Giant chess is quite common in Geraldion. We will not delve into the rules of the game, we'll just say that the game takes place on an h × w field, and it is painted in two colors, but not like in chess. Almost all cells of the field are white and only some of them are black. Currently Gerald is finishing a game of giant chess against his friend Pollard. Gerald has almost won, and the only thing he needs to win is to bring the pawn from the upper left corner of the board, where it is now standing, to the lower right corner. Gerald is so confident of victory that he became interested, in how many ways can he win?

The pawn, which Gerald has got left can go in two ways: one cell down or one cell to the right. In addition, it can not go to the black cells, otherwise the Gerald still loses. There are no other pawns or pieces left on the field, so that, according to the rules of giant chess Gerald moves his pawn until the game is over, and Pollard is just watching this process.

Input

The first line of the input contains three integers: h, w, n — the sides of the board and the number of black cells (1 ≤ h, w ≤ 105, 1 ≤ n ≤ 2000). 

Next n lines contain the description of black cells. The i-th of these lines contains numbers ri, ci (1 ≤ ri ≤ h, 1 ≤ ci ≤ w) — the number of the row and column of the i-th cell.

It is guaranteed that the upper left and lower right cell are white and all cells in the description are distinct.

Output

Print a single line — the remainder of the number of ways to move Gerald's pawn from the upper left to the lower right corner modulo 109 + 7.

assistant: ### Phase 3: Implementing Performance-Characterizing Invariants in C++

Here, we'll translate the natural language invariants into C++ runtime checks:

1. **Array Initialization Overhead Invariant:**  
   Check if the sum of the board dimensions `h + w` is large, leading to computational overhead during the initialization of factorial and inverse arrays.

```cpp
void check_array_initialization_overhead(int h, int w) {
    if (h + w > 200000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large h + w causing array initialization overhead!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

2. **Recursive Exponentiation Invariant:**  
   Check if the recursive exponentiation function (`ModPow`) is called with large arguments, potentially leading to deep recursion.

```cpp
void check_recursive_exponentiation(int base, int exp) {
    if (exp > 10000) {  // assuming a threshold for the exponent
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large exponent in ModPow causing deep recursion!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

3. **Combinatorial Calculations Invariant:**  
   Check if combinatorial functions are invoked with large indices, causing expensive computations.

```cpp
void check_combinatorial_calculations(int a, int b) {
    if (a + b > 200000) {  // assuming a threshold for the combined indices
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large indices in combinatorial calculations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrating Checks into the Original C++ Program

Now, let's integrate these checks into the code at appropriate points:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

long long int fact[1000000];
long long int inv[1000000];

long long int ModPow(long long int base, long long int exp) {
    check_recursive_exponentiation(base, exp);
    if (exp == 0) return 1;
    if (exp % 2 == 1) return (base * ModPow(base, exp - 1)) % 1000000007;
    long long int a = ModPow(base, exp / 2);
    return (a * a) % 1000000007;
}

long long int comb(int a, int b) {
    check_combinatorial_calculations(a, b);
    if (a < 0 || b < 0) return 0;
    long long int ans = fact[a + b];
    ans *= inv[a];
    ans %= 1000000007;
    ans *= inv[b];
    ans %= 1000000007;
    return ans;
}

int main() {
    int h, w, n;
    cin >> h >> w >> n;

    check_array_initialization_overhead(h, w);

    fact[0] = 1;
    inv[0] = 1;
    for (int i = 1; i < h + w + 7; i++) {
        fact[i] = i * fact[i - 1];
        fact[i] %= 1000000007;
        inv[i] = ModPow(i, 1000000007 - 2) * inv[i - 1];
        inv[i] %= 1000000007;
    }

    pair<int, int> cells[n + 2];
    cells[0] = pair<int, int>(1, 1);
    for (int i = 1; i < n + 1; i++) cin >> cells[i].first >> cells[i].second;
    cells[n + 1] = pair<int, int>(h, w);
    sort(cells, cells + n + 2);

    long long int DP[n + 2];
    DP[0] = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i < n + 2; i++) {
        DP[i] = comb(cells[i].first - 1, cells[i].second - 1);
        for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
            long long int can = DP[j] * comb(cells[i].first - cells[j].first,
                                             cells[i].second - cells[j].second);
            can %= 1000000007;
            DP[i] -= can;
            DP[i] += 1000000007;
            DP[i] %= 1000000007;
        }
    }

    cout << DP[n + 1] << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Comments on Integration

- **Array Initialization Check:** Placed right after input reading to avoid unnecessary overhead if conditions are not met.
- **Recursive Exponentiation Check:** Integrated directly into the `ModPow` function to preempt deep recursion.
- **Combinatorial Calculation Check:** Placed in the `comb` function to detect large indices dynamically.

These checks help identify potential performance bottlenecks at runtime, aiding in debugging and optimization efforts.
