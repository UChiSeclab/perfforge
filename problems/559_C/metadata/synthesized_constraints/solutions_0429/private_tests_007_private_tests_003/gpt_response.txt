### Phase 1: Identifying Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

Upon examining the line-level hit counts for both the slow and fast inputs, we can identify a few key differences:

1. **Lines 41 and 43**: These lines, responsible for calculating factorials and their modular inverses using loops, have significantly more hits in the slow input (200,001 times) compared to the fast input (5 times). The loop iterates up to \(h + w\), which is substantial for the slow input.

2. **Line 46**: This loop iterates over the number of black cells, plus one. While this is not a major difference in hit counts compared to the fast input, any additional operations inside this loop can compound in larger inputs.

3. **Nested Loop at Lines 48-54**: The nested loop iterates over all previously considered black cells for each current black cell. This can lead to a quadratic complexity with respect to `n`, the number of black cells. Given the constraints (up to 2000 black cells), this can become a bottleneck.

### Phase 2: Deriving Performance-Characterizing Invariants

From the above analysis, we can derive natural language descriptions of the conditions under which the program enters a slow path:

1. **Invariant on Large Dimensions**:
   - **Natural Language Description**: "If the combined dimensions of the board, \(h + w\), are large, the precomputation of factorials and modular inverses becomes costly."
   - **Rationale**: The calculations involving factorials and inverses in lines 41 and 43 are dependent on \(h + w\), making them expensive for large values.

2. **Invariant on Number of Black Cells**:
   - **Natural Language Description**: "If the number of black cells, \(n\), is close to the maximum constraint, the program may slow down due to nested loops iterating over these cells."
   - **Rationale**: The nested loops at lines 48-54 have a complexity that may become significant as \(n\) approaches 2000, due to repeated calculations for each pair of black cells.

3. **Invariant on Path Calculations**:
   - **Natural Language Description**: "If the set of black cells densely populates the board, especially near critical paths, path recalculations become expensive."
   - **Rationale**: The program recalculates possible paths at each step considering the black cells, which can be costly when significant recalculations are required due to dense or poorly distributed black cells.

### Conclusion

These performance-characterizing invariants highlight the potential slowdowns due to large board dimensions and the number of black cells. These conditions strongly correlate with input patterns that can trigger computationally expensive operations in the given C program.

### Phase 3: Implementing the Performance Invariants in C++

Here are the C++ code snippets implementing the invariants as runtime checks. Each snippet detects specific conditions based on the natural language invariants described in Phase 2:

#### Invariant Checkers

1. **Invariant on Large Dimensions**:

```cpp
void check_large_dimension_invariant(int h, int w) {
    if ((h + w) > 200000) {  // Threshold based on performance concerns
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to large board dimensions!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

2. **Invariant on Number of Black Cells**:

```cpp
void check_black_cells_invariant(int n) {
    if (n > 1900) {  // Threshold close to the maximum constraint
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to high number of black cells!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

3. **Invariant on Path Calculations**:

```cpp
void check_dense_black_cells_invariant(int blackCellsDensity) {
    if (blackCellsDensity > 80) {  // Hypothetical threshold for density
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to dense black cells!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrating the Checker Code

Here's the original program with the invariant checks integrated at strategic points:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
const int N = 1e5 + 10;
const int M = 2010;
const int mod = 1e9 + 7;
struct dd {
  int x, y;
};
dd a[M];
int f[M];
long long inv[N << 1], fac[N << 1];

// Checker for large board dimensions
void check_large_dimension_invariant(int h, int w) {
    if ((h + w) > 200000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to large board dimensions!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Checker for high number of black cells
void check_black_cells_invariant(int n) {
    if (n > 1900) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to high number of black cells!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Function to read input
int re() {
  int x = 0;
  char c = getchar();
  bool p = 0;
  for (; c < '0' || c > '9'; c = getchar()) p = (c == '-' || p) ? 1 : 0;
  for (; c >= '0' && c <= '9'; c = getchar()) x = x * 10 + (c - '0');
  return p ? -x : x;
}

int comp(dd x, dd y) {
  if (x.x == y.x) return x.y < y.y;
  return x.x < y.x;
}

int ksm(int x, int y) {
  int s = 1;
  for (; y; y >>= 1, x = 1LL * x * x % mod)
    if (y & 1) s = 1LL * s * x % mod;
  return s;
}

int C(int x, int y) { return fac[y] * inv[x] % mod * inv[y - x] % mod; }

int main() {
  int i, j, h, w, n, o;
  h = re();
  w = re();
  n = re();

  // Place checkers after reading input
  check_large_dimension_invariant(h, w);
  check_black_cells_invariant(n);

  for (i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    a[i].x = re();
    a[i].y = re();
  }
  sort(a + 1, a + n + 1, comp);
  for (fac[0] = i = 1, o = h + w; i <= o; i++) fac[i] = fac[i - 1] * i % mod;
  inv[o] = ksm(fac[o], mod - 2);
  for (i = o - 1; i >= 0; i--) inv[i] = inv[i + 1] * (i + 1) % mod;
  a[n + 1].x = h;
  a[n + 1].y = w;
  for (i = 1; i <= n + 1; i++) {
    f[i] = C(a[i].x - 1, a[i].x + a[i].y - 2);
    for (j = 1; j < i; j++)
      if (a[j].x <= a[i].x && a[j].y <= a[i].y)
        f[i] =
            (f[i] - 1LL * f[j] *
                        C(a[i].x - a[j].x, a[i].x + a[i].y - a[j].x - a[j].y) %
                        mod) %
            mod;
  }
  printf("%d", (f[n + 1] + mod) % mod);
  return 0;
}
```

### Comments on Integration

- **Large Dimension Check**: Placed after reading `h` and `w` to quickly abort when dimensions are too large.
- **Black Cells Check**: Placed after reading `n` to quickly abort for too many black cells.
- **Density Check**: The "blackCellsDensity" is a hypothetical measure; in practice, this would be calculated based on proximity or other characteristics of black cell distribution. 

These checks are designed to catch potential performance bottlenecks early in the execution, helping to identify slow scenarios during testing or fuzzing.
