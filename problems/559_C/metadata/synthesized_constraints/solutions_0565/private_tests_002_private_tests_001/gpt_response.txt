=== Invariants Response ===
To analyze the given C program and generate performance-characterizing invariants, we'll follow the outlined phases and steps:

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Line-Level Hit Count Comparison:**

   Upon reviewing the hit count data, the following observations are made:

   - The `exp` function (lines 8-16) is called significantly more often in the slow input than in the fast input, with lines 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, and 16 having hit counts in the millions for the slow input compared to the tens of thousands for the fast input.
   - The loop at line 32 runs 200,001 times for the slow input compared to only 2,001 times for the fast input. This loop calculates factorial and inverse factorial arrays, invoking the `exp` function.
   - The nested loops starting at lines 36 and 38 iterate over combinations of positions, but these are not hit significantly more compared to the `exp` function.

2. **Interaction with Data Structures and Input Constraints:**

   - The `exp` function is used to compute modular inverses, a key part of the factorial precomputation. This precomputation is disproportionately costly for larger values of `h` and `w` due to the vast number of iterations.
   - The main computation, dependent on the factorial values, suggests that large board dimensions cause extensive computations in setting up these values.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the observations, here are the performance-characterizing invariants:

1. **Large Factorial Precomputation:**

   - **Invariant:** "If the dimensions of the board `h` and `w` are large, the factorial precomputation may dominate execution time due to the repeated computation of modular inverses."

   - **Explanation:** The `exp` function, used heavily for computing inverse factorials, is a recursive function that becomes a bottleneck when the dimensions of the board are near their maximum constraints (e.g., `h = 100,000` or `w = 100,000`).

2. **High Computational Load with Large Dimensions:**

   - **Invariant:** "When `h` and `w` are both large, the nested loops processing positions are computationally intensive, particularly when calculating combinations for paths around black cells."

   - **Explanation:** The nested loops contribute to a high computational load, especially as the number of valid paths must be recalculated when black cells obstruct direct paths, with the factorial values recalculated each time.

3. **Sparse Black Cells with Large Dimensions:**

   - **Invariant:** "Sparse distribution of black cells in a large board leads to excessive recalculations of paths, particularly when their positions minimally intersect optimal paths."

   - **Explanation:** When `n` is small but the board is large, there are fewer black cells to block paths, leading to a high number of path recalculations without significant pruning, causing inefficiency.

### Conclusion

The main sources of inefficiency arise from large board dimensions causing extensive precomputation of factorial values and recalculations for paths. These conditions lead to a disproportionate increase in execution time due to recursive operations and nested loops, especially when the board dimensions approach their upper constraints.

=== Checker Response ===
Let's proceed with Phase 3, where we implement the natural language invariants inferred previously in C++.

### Phase 3: Implement Checkers in C++

Here are the C++ checkers based on the performance-characterizing invariants derived in Phase 2:

1. **Checker for Large Factorial Precomputation:**

   ```cpp
   void check_large_dimensions_invariant(long long h, long long w) {
       if (h > 50000 && w > 50000) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large factorial precomputation!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Checker for High Computational Load with Large Dimensions:**

   ```cpp
   void check_high_computation_invariant(long long h, long long w) {
       if (h > 90000 || w > 90000) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high computational load due to large dimensions!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Checker for Sparse Black Cells with Large Dimensions:**

   ```cpp
   void check_sparse_black_cells_invariant(long long n, long long h, long long w) {
       if (n < 10 && (h > 95000 || w > 95000)) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - sparse black cells with large board dimensions!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Integrate Checkers into Original Program

Now, let's integrate these checkers into the original C++ program. We will place the checks after reading the inputs, before the heavy computational sections.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
long long h, w, n;
pair<long long, long long> a[2005];
long long fact[200005];
long long ifact[200005];
long long dp[2005];

long long exp(long long a, long long b) {
  if (b == 0) return 1;
  if (b == 1) return a;
  if (b % 2 == 0) {
    long long r = exp(a, b / 2);
    return (r * r) % 1000000007;
  }
  long long r = exp(a, b - 1);
  return (r * a) % 1000000007;
}

long long C(long long n, long long k) {
  return (((fact[n] * ifact[k]) % 1000000007) * ifact[n - k]) % 1000000007;
}

// Checker functions to detect performance bottlenecks
void check_large_dimensions_invariant(long long h, long long w) {
    if (h > 50000 && w > 50000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large factorial precomputation!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_high_computation_invariant(long long h, long long w) {
    if (h > 90000 || w > 90000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high computational load due to large dimensions!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_sparse_black_cells_invariant(long long n, long long h, long long w) {
    if (n < 10 && (h > 95000 || w > 95000)) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - sparse black cells with large board dimensions!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
  scanf("%lld %lld %lld", &h, &w, &n);

  // Insert checker function calls after reading inputs
  check_large_dimensions_invariant(h, w);
  check_high_computation_invariant(h, w);
  check_sparse_black_cells_invariant(n, h, w);

  for (long long i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    scanf("%lld %lld", &a[i].first, &a[i].second);
    a[i].first--;
    a[i].second--;
  }
  sort(a, a + n);
  a[n++] = make_pair(h - 1, w - 1);
  fact[0] = 1;
  ifact[0] = 1;
  for (long long i = 1; i <= max(w, h) * 2; i++) {
    fact[i] = (fact[i - 1] * i) % 1000000007;
    ifact[i] = exp(fact[i], 1000000007 - 2);
  }
  for (long long i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    long long num = C(a[i].first + a[i].second, a[i].first);
    for (long long j = 0; j < i; j++) {
      if (a[j].first <= a[i].first && a[j].second <= a[i].second) {
        int sub =
            (dp[j] * C((a[i].first - a[j].first) + (a[i].second - a[j].second),
                       a[i].first - a[j].first)) %
            1000000007;
        num = (num - sub + 1000000007) % 1000000007;
      }
    }
    dp[i] = num;
  }
  cout << dp[n - 1] << endl;
}
```

### Explanation:

- **Check Placement:** The checkers are placed immediately after reading the inputs, ensuring that the program aborts early if a bottleneck condition is detected.
- **Checker Functions:** Each checker function corresponds to an invariant derived earlier, and they are designed to capture potential performance bottlenecks without adding unnecessary overhead in tight loops.
