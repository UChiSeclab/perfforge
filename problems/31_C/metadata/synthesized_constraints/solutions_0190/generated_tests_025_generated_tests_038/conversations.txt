system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

At the beginning of the new semester there is new schedule in the Berland State University. According to this schedule, n groups have lessons at the room 31. For each group the starting time of the lesson and the finishing time of the lesson are known. It has turned out that it is impossible to hold all lessons, because for some groups periods of their lessons intersect. If at some moment of time one groups finishes it's lesson, and the other group starts the lesson, their lessons don't intersect.

The dean wants to cancel the lesson in one group so that no two time periods of lessons of the remaining groups intersect. You are to find all ways to do that.

Input

The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 5000) — amount of groups, which have lessons in the room 31. Then n lines follow, each of them contains two integers li ri (1 ≤ li < ri ≤ 106) — starting and finishing times of lesson of the i-th group. It is possible that initially no two lessons intersect (see sample 1).

Output

Output integer k — amount of ways to cancel the lesson in exactly one group so that no two time periods of lessons of the remaining groups intersect. In the second line output k numbers — indexes of groups, where it is possible to cancel the lesson. Groups are numbered starting from 1 in the order that they were given in the input. Output the numbers in increasing order.

assistant: To diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input, we will follow the given two-phase analysis to derive performance-characterizing invariants.

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Compare Line-Level Hit Counts:**
   - Line 10: The loop runs 1,000,001 times on both inputs, but the `if` condition on line 11 is checked 1,000,000 times for the slow input and only twice for the fast input.
   - Line 16: This loop is hit once for the slow input and not at all for the fast input.
   - Line 27: Similarly, this loop runs 999,963 times for the slow input and not at all for the fast input.
   - Line 33: This loop runs 5 times for the slow input and not at all for the fast input.

2. **Pinpoint Lines/Functions with More Hits:**
   - The significant difference in execution paths is associated with the loops starting at lines 16 and 27, which are nearly bypassed for the fast input.
   - The condition `z[i] > 2` is not met for the fast input, leading to an early exit.

3. **Infer Interaction with Data Structures/Loops:**
   - The program computes a running sum in `z[]` that tracks the overlap of lesson times, and uses this to determine if an overlap of more than two lessons occurs (lines 10 and 11).
   - Line 16 aims to find the first time point where exactly two lessons overlap, and line 27 finds the last such time point.
   - A significant loop occurs to count occurrences of overlap until a solution can be derived (line 33).

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **Generate Natural Language Statements:**
   - **Invariant 1:** "If the cumulative overlap of lessons (`z[i]`) exceeds the threshold more frequently, the program takes longer as it processes more overlap points."
   - **Invariant 2:** "If the initial overlap checks in the first heavy loop (`z[i] > 2`) do not cause an immediate exit, subsequent loops (`z[i] == 2`) can become costly as they process a large range of times."

2. **Abstract Into Categories/Thresholds:**
   - The key condition is the presence of multiple overlapping lessons at different time points.
   - If `z[i]` maintains a value of 2 across a substantial range, both `b` and `c` get calculated over many iterations, leading to more work in identifying removable lessons.

3. **Correlate Conditions to Input Patterns:**
   - Overlaps that persist for a wide duration or occur frequently at different time points can lead to slow execution.
   - When the difference between `b` and `c` is large, more iterations are needed to determine which lessons to remove.

### Conclusion

Here are the performance-characterizing invariants derived from the analysis:

1. **Invariant 1:** "The program slows down when there are multiple consecutive time points where exactly two lessons overlap, as it requires processing these points extensively to determine correct group removals."

2. **Invariant 2:** "If the overlap of lessons persists across a large time span without exceeding critical thresholds initially, loops designed to find first and last overlaps (`b` and `c`) become computationally expensive."

These conditions capture scenarios that lead to performance degradation under the problem constraints, offering insights into why certain inputs result in slower execution.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
At the beginning of the new semester there is new schedule in the Berland State University. According to this schedule, n groups have lessons at the room 31. For each group the starting time of the lesson and the finishing time of the lesson are known. It has turned out that it is impossible to hold all lessons, because for some groups periods of their lessons intersect. If at some moment of time one groups finishes it's lesson, and the other group starts the lesson, their lessons don't intersect.

The dean wants to cancel the lesson in one group so that no two time periods of lessons of the remaining groups intersect. You are to find all ways to do that.

Input

The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 5000) — amount of groups, which have lessons in the room 31. Then n lines follow, each of them contains two integers li ri (1 ≤ li < ri ≤ 106) — starting and finishing times of lesson of the i-th group. It is possible that initially no two lessons intersect (see sample 1).

Output

Output integer k — amount of ways to cancel the lesson in exactly one group so that no two time periods of lessons of the remaining groups intersect. In the second line output k numbers — indexes of groups, where it is possible to cancel the lesson. Groups are numbered starting from 1 in the order that they were given in the input. Output the numbers in increasing order.

assistant: ### Phase 3: Implement the Natural Language Invariants in C++

Based on the performance-characterizing invariants identified earlier, here are the C++ runtime checks:

1. **Invariant 1:** "The program slows down when there are multiple consecutive time points where exactly two lessons overlap, as it requires processing these points extensively to determine correct group removals."
   
   We will check if there is a significant range of indices `i` where `z[i] == 2`, which may indicate a performance bottleneck.

   ```cpp
   void check_overlap_invariant(int count_consecutive_overlap) {
       if (count_consecutive_overlap > 1000) { // Arbitrary threshold based on problem context
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - extensive consecutive overlaps!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Invariant 2:** "If the overlap of lessons persists across a large time span without exceeding critical thresholds initially, loops designed to find first and last overlaps (`b` and `c`) become computationally expensive."
   
   We will check if the span between `b` and `c` is large, indicating a potentially costly scenario.

   ```cpp
   void check_span_invariant(int b, int c) {
       if ((c - b) > 1000) { // Arbitrary threshold for potentially large span
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large span between b and c!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Integrate the Checker Code into the Original Program

Now, let's integrate these checks into the C++ code for performance diagnosis.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int a, l[100009], r[100009], z[100009 * 10], b, c;
long long sm;
vector<int> v;

// Checker for consecutive overlaps
void check_overlap_invariant(int count_consecutive_overlap) {
    if (count_consecutive_overlap > 1000) { // Arbitrary threshold based on problem context
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - extensive consecutive overlaps!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Checker for span between b and c
void check_span_invariant(int b, int c) {

### Explanation of Checker Integration

- **Checker for Consecutive Overlaps:** This check is placed after calculating consecutive overlaps in the array `z[]`. If the count of consecutive overlaps exceeds a threshold, this indicates a possible slowdown due to extensive overlap processing.

- **Checker for Span between `b` and `c`:** This check is placed after both `b` and `c` are determined. If their span is large, it signals a potentially expensive computation, and the check warns and aborts if necessary.

These checks aim to aid performance analysis by automatically detecting scenarios likely to cause slowdowns, without interfering with the main program logic.
