### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

The significant differences in line-level hit counts between the slow and fast inputs help identify potential performance bottlenecks:

1. **Loop Iterations**:
   - The line `for (int k = c; k <= 100; k++)` (Line 12) is executed much more frequently for the slow input (939,300 times) than for the fast input (223,200 times).

2. **Triangle Condition Check**:
   - The condition `if (i + j > k && i + k > j && j + k > i)` (Line 13) is evaluated 930,000 times for the slow input compared to 213,900 times for the fast input. This suggests that the condition is checked multiple times without breaking early.

3. **Result Update**:
   - The line `ans = min(ans, i - a + j - b + k - c);` (Line 14) is executed 495,318 times for the slow input, but only 134,307 times for the fast input. This indicates the program takes time to find a valid triangle with minimal increasing operations.

From this analysis, the inefficiency likely stems from iterating over all possible lengths for `i`, `j`, and `k` and evaluating the triangle inequality conditions repeatedly without early exits or optimizations.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the analysis above, we can derive several performance-characterizing invariants that explain under what conditions the code slows down:

1. **Condition on Close Stick Lengths**:
   - **Natural Language Invariant**: "If the lengths of two sticks are significantly smaller compared to the third stick, the loop will iterate extensively as many combinations will be tested before meeting the triangle inequality."
   - **Explanation**: When two sticks are much smaller, it takes many increments of their lengths before satisfying the triangle inequality with the largest stick, leading to significant iterations and evaluations.

2. **Condition on Initial Imbalance**:
   - **Natural Language Invariant**: "If there is a significant imbalance among the stick lengths initially, with one stick being close to the maximum possible length and the others near the minimum, the program may require a large number of iterations and increments to form a valid triangle."
   - **Explanation**: A large imbalance forces many iterations over `i`, `j`, and `k` to satisfy the triangle conditions, increasing the number of operations required.

3. **Condition on Near-Limit Sticks**:
   - **Natural Language Invariant**: "When any two stick lengths are near the minimum value and the third is substantially larger, the function loops through many ineffective combinations before reaching a valid configuration."
   - **Explanation**: Sticks with lengths close to the minimum value and significantly smaller than a third one require many length adjustments to overcome the discrepancy and form a triangle.

By understanding these invariants, you can anticipate scenarios that may lead to slow performance and potentially refactor the code to reduce unnecessary iterations and optimize for early exit conditions.

### Phase 3: Implement the Natural Language Invariants in C++

Here are the C++ checkers for the performance-characterizing invariants derived previously:

1. **Condition on Close Stick Lengths**:
    ```cpp
    void check_close_sticks_invariant(int a, int b, int c) {
        if (std::max({a, b, c}) >= a + b + c - std::max({a, b, c})) {
            cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to close stick lengths!" << endl;
            abort();
        }
    }
    ```

2. **Condition on Initial Imbalance**:
    ```cpp
    void check_initial_imbalance_invariant(int a, int b, int c) {
        int max_length = std::max({a, b, c});
        int sum_others = a + b + c - max_length;
        if (max_length >= sum_others * 2) {
            cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to initial imbalance!" << endl;
            abort();
        }
    }
    ```

3. **Condition on Near-Limit Sticks**:
    ```cpp
    void check_near_limit_sticks_invariant(int a, int b, int c) {
        int min_length = std::min({a, b, c});
        int max_length = std::max({a, b, c});
        if (min_length == 1 && max_length > 50) { // Arbitrary threshold for demonstration
            cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to near-limit sticks!" << endl;
            abort();
        }
    }
    ```

### Phase 4: Integrate Checkers into the C++ Program

Below is the final C++ program with the integrated performance checkers:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Checker functions for performance-characterizing invariants
void check_close_sticks_invariant(int a, int b, int c) {
    if (std::max({a, b, c}) >= a + b + c - std::max({a, b, c})) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to close stick lengths!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_initial_imbalance_invariant(int a, int b, int c) {
    int max_length = std::max({a, b, c});
    int sum_others = a + b + c - max_length;
    if (max_length >= sum_others * 2) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to initial imbalance!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_near_limit_sticks_invariant(int a, int b, int c) {
    int min_length = std::min({a, b, c});
    int max_length = std::max({a, b, c});
    if (min_length == 1 && max_length > 50) { // Arbitrary threshold for demonstration
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to near-limit sticks!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(0);

    int a, b, c;
    cin >> a >> b >> c;

    // Insert invariant checks
    check_close_sticks_invariant(a, b, c);
    check_initial_imbalance_invariant(a, b, c);
    check_near_limit_sticks_invariant(a, b, c);

    int inf = 0x3f3f3f3f;
    int ans = inf;

    // Original code calculating the minimum number of minutes
    for (int i = a; i <= 100; i++) {
        for (int j = b; j <= 100; j++) {
            for (int k = c; k <= 100; k++) {
                if (i + j > k && i + k > j && j + k > i)
                    ans = min(ans, i - a + j - b + k - c);
            }
        }
    }

    cout << ans;
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

- **Checker Functions**: These functions are placed before the heavy computation loops to ensure that any potential performance bottlenecks are detected early based on the input values.
- **Integration Points**: The checkers are called right after reading the input values of `a`, `b`, and `c`. This ensures that the conditions are verified without adding overhead to the main computational loops.
