### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Comparison of Line-Level Hit Counts:**
   - The loops at lines 10 to 13 are hit significantly more times on the slow input compared to the fast input:
     - **Line 10 (for-loop over `i`)**: Slow input (401), Fast input (302)
     - **Line 11 (nested for-loop over `j`)**: Slow input (80600), Fast input (45752)
     - **Line 12 (innermost for-loop over `k`)**: Slow input (21493600), Fast input (13680751)
     - **Line 13 (if-condition and minimum calculation)**: Slow input (21413400), Fast input (13635300)

2. **Pinpointing Lines with More Hits:**
   - The nested loops (lines 10-13) see a massive number of hits, especially the innermost loop, indicating significant processing time spent here.

3. **Inference on Interaction with Data Structures and Loops:**
   - The problem involves iterating over possible stick lengths (`i`, `j`, `k`) for which a triangle can be formed. If the initial values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are small, the loops iterate extensively to find a valid solution.
   - The loops incrementally increase the potential triangle side lengths and check for valid triangles until the condition `i < j + k` is satisfied. This can be computationally expensive when starting values are low.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **Natural Language Statements:**

   - **Invariant 1: Small Initial Values and Extensive Iteration:**
     - *Description:* "If the initial lengths of the sticks are small and close to each other, the loops iterate extensively over possible lengths to find a valid triangle configuration, leading to slow execution."
     - *Explanation:* Starting with smaller stick lengths compared to a max possible side of 400 requires more iterations to find a combination satisfying the triangle inequality.

   - **Invariant 2: Uneven Distribution of Initial Stick Lengths:**
     - *Description:* "When the initial stick lengths are quite similar or all small, the innermost loop runs a significant number of times due to the large range of potential values."
     - *Explanation:* The configuration where `a`, `b`, and `c` are initially similar (and small) causes the loops to explore many combinations, increasing computational effort.

2. **Thresholds and Correlations with Input Patterns:**

   - **Thresholds for Iteration:** Given the constraints (e.g., `a`, `b`, `c` â‰¤ 100), combinations where `a`, `b`, and `c` start small (e.g., close to 1) and similar lead to a large search space, especially when they need to be incremented up to larger values like 400.

   - **Execution Condition:** The slow execution is more likely when the starting stick lengths are such that many increments are necessary to satisfy the triangle inequality. This is especially true when the differences between the stick lengths are minimal, compelling the program to explore numerous configurations.

### Summary
The program's performance bottleneck is primarily due to the nested loop structure, which iterates over a large number of potential side lengths to satisfy the triangle inequality condition. This is exacerbated when the initial stick lengths are small and similar, leading to extensive computations.

## Phase 3: Implementing the Natural Language Invariants in C++

Below are C++ code snippets that implement the performance-characterizing invariants derived earlier. These snippets can later be integrated into the original program to help detect conditions leading to slow performance.

### Invariant 1: Small Initial Values and Extensive Iteration

```cpp
void check_small_sticks_invariant(int a, int b, int c) {
    if (a <= 10 && b <= 10 && c <= 10) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - Small initial stick lengths causing extensive iteration!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Invariant 2: Uneven Distribution of Initial Stick Lengths

```cpp
void check_similar_sticks_invariant(int a, int b, int c) {
    if (abs(a - b) <= 5 && abs(b - c) <= 5 && abs(c - a) <= 5) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - Similar stick lengths causing large search space exploration!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

## Phase 4: Integrating Checkers into the Original Program

Now, let's integrate these checks into the original C++ program, ensuring they are placed in an optimal location to detect the bottlenecks without introducing additional overhead.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int a, b, c;
int answer = 1e9 + 7;

void read() { 
    cin >> a >> b >> c; 
}

// Performance invariant checkers
void check_small_sticks_invariant(int a, int b, int c) {
    if (a <= 10 && b <= 10 && c <= 10) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - Small initial stick lengths causing extensive iteration!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_similar_sticks_invariant(int a, int b, int c) {
    if (abs(a - b) <= 5 && abs(b - c) <= 5 && abs(c - a) <= 5) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - Similar stick lengths causing large search space exploration!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    read();
    
    // Place invariant checks after reading inputs
    check_small_sticks_invariant(a, b, c);
    check_similar_sticks_invariant(a, b, c);
    
    if (b > a && b > c) swap(b, c);
    if (c > a && c > b) swap(a, c);
    
    for (int i = a; i <= 400; i++)
        for (int j = b; j <= i; j++)
            for (int k = c; k <= i; k++) {
                if (i < j + k) 
                    answer = min(answer, i - a + j - b + k - c);
            }
    
    cout << answer;
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Invariant Checks:** The checks are added immediately after reading the input. This ensures that the conditions leading to performance bottlenecks are detected early.
- **Check Placement:** The checks are inserted before significant computation (the nested loops), preventing unnecessary computations if a bottleneck condition is detected.
- **Caveat:** The `abort()` function is used to stop execution if a bottleneck condition is met, which is useful in a testing or debugging context but should be handled differently in production code.
