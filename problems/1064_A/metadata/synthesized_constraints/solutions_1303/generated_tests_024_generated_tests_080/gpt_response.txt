### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

Based on the hit counts:

1. **Nested Loops**: The loops at lines 14, 15, and 16 have significantly high hit counts for the slow input, with line 16 having the highest. For the slow input, line 16 was hit 499,280 times compared to only 810 times for the fast input. This indicates that the loops are iterating a large number of times.

2. **`check` Function**: The `check` function, which determines if the current stick lengths can form a triangle, is called excessively (493,039 times for the slow input versus 729 times for the fast input). This suggests that most of the time is spent checking combinations of stick lengths.

3. **Max Length as Loop Bound**: The loop bounds are determined by the maximum stick length using `max(a, max(b, c))`. For the slow input, with stick lengths 8, 1, and 78, this results in loops executing up to 78 times for each dimension of the triple nested loop, leading to a cubic time complexity in terms of the maximum stick length.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants (Natural Language)

1. **High Loop Iterations Due to Large Stick Length**:
   - **Invariant**: "When the maximum stick length is significantly larger than the others, the number of iterations in the nested loops increases dramatically, leading to a slowdown. Specifically, if one stick length is close to the upper constraint (e.g., near 100) while others are small, the loop will execute many unnecessary checks."
   
2. **Inefficient Triangle Validity Checks**:
   - **Invariant**: "If repeated checks for triangle inequality are necessary due to large discrepancies in stick lengths, particularly when one stick is much larger than the sum of the other two, the program spends excessive time verifying potential triangle configurations."
   
3. **Imbalanced Stick Lengths**:
   - **Invariant**: "The algorithm becomes inefficient when the stick lengths are imbalanced, causing the search space for valid triangle configurations to expand unnecessarily. This typically occurs when the largest stick length is disproportionate to the sum of the other two, requiring many adjustments to find a valid triangle."

These performance-characterizing invariants highlight scenarios where the program's efficiency degrades, primarily due to large maximum stick lengths and imbalanced stick configurations that lead to excessive iterations and checks.

### Phase 3: Implement the Natural Language Invariants in C++

Based on the previously inferred performance-characterizing invariants, we can create checker functions in C++ to detect when these conditions occur at runtime.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Helper checker functions
void check_large_max_length(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large maximum stick length compared to others!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_imbalanced_sticks(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - imbalanced stick lengths!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrate Checker Code with the Original Program

Below, we integrate the checker code with the original C++ program to assess performance bottlenecks efficiently.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Function to check if three sides can form a triangle
bool check(int a, int b, int c) {
    if (a + b > c && b + c > a && a + c > b) return true;
    return false;
}

// Helper checker functions
void check_large_max_length(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large maximum stick length compared to others!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_imbalanced_sticks(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - imbalanced stick lengths!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(0);
    cout.tie(0);

    int a, b, c;
    cin >> a >> b >> c;

    int max_length = max({a, b, c});
    int sum_of_others = a + b + c - max_length;

    // Insert checks based on the identified performance invariants
    check_large_max_length(max_length > 50 && sum_of_others < 50);
    check_imbalanced_sticks(max_length > sum_of_others);

    int mi = 1000;
    for (int i = 0; i <= max(a, max(b, c)); i++)
        for (int j = 0; j <= max(a, max(b, c)); j++)
            for (int k = 0; k <= max(a, max(b, c)); k++)
                if (check(a + i, b + j, c + k))
                    mi = min(mi, i + j + k);

    cout << mi;

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

- **`check_large_max_length`**: This function warns if the maximum stick length is disproportionately large compared to the sum of the other two, indicating the loops might iterate excessively.
  
- **`check_imbalanced_sticks`**: This function warns when the maximum stick length exceeds the sum of the other two, making it impossible to form a triangle without significant adjustments.

These checks are inserted before the loop begins to avoid adding overhead during each iteration, allowing the program to detect potential performance issues effectively.
