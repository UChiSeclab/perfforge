### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

Based on the provided hit count information, the following observations can be made:

1. **Line 13 (Outer Loop)**: The line `for (int i = 0; i < k; i++)` is executed 100,000 times for the slow input and only 4 times for the fast input. This indicates that the number of iterations of this loop is directly proportional to the value of `k`.

2. **Line 16 (Inner Loop)**: The line `for (int j = 0; j < MAXN; j++)` is executed 300,096,999 times for the slow input compared to only 9,003 times for the fast input. This indicates that the inner loop is very costly because it iterates over `MAXN` (3000) elements in each of its 100,000 iterations (for the slow input).

3. **Lines 17-28 (Conditional Operations)**: The condition `if (a[j] % 2)` and the operations inside this if-else block are executed an extremely large number of times (almost 300 million). This suggests that these lines are critical to the performance and are executed frequently due to the large number of iterations of the inner loop.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Here are the natural language performance invariants for this program's execution:

1. **Long Iterative Processes with High k**:
   - "When the number of operations `k` is large, the outer loop iterates many times. Combined with the inner loop that processes all possible strength values, it leads to high computational cost. This is a significant performance bottleneck."

2. **High Cost of Processing a Large Range**:
   - "If the range of possible strength values (determined by `MAXN`) is large and processed repeatedly within the loop, it can cause significant slowdown, especially when `k` is high."

3. **Frequent Bitwise Operations on Large Arrays**:
   - "The frequent execution of bitwise XOR operations on large arrays (size defined by `MAXN`) for all iterations of `k` leads to high computational overhead. This is exacerbated when the array's non-zero elements are distributed such that conditions trigger more operations."

4. **Alternating Conditions in Large Iterative Structures**:
   - "The alternation in condition checks and corresponding operations when the array elements are odd or even, performed across large loops, contributes substantially to execution time, particularly when repeatedly applied with a high `k` value."

These invariants highlight the primary factors contributing to the performance issues, especially when the value of `k` is large, as demonstrated in the slow input scenario. By understanding these triggers, one can optimize the conditions under which the code executes slow paths and potentially redesign the approach to handle large `k` values more efficiently.

### Phase 3: Implementing the Natural Language Invariants in C++

We will implement the performance-characterizing invariants identified in Phase 2 as runtime checks using the provided template:

1. **Long Iterative Processes with High k**:
   - We will check if `k` is large as this directly impacts the number of iterations in the outer loop.

```cpp
void check_high_k_invariant(int k) {
    if (k > 50000) {  // Arbitrary large threshold, considering constraints
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to high k!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

2. **High Cost of Processing a Large Range**:
   - Check if the possible strength values are being processed repeatedly with large `k`.

```cpp
void check_large_range_invariant(int k, int maxN) {
    if (k * maxN > 150000000) {  // Threshold based on observed slowdown
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to large range processing!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

3. **Frequent Bitwise Operations on Large Arrays**:
   - Monitor the operations on array elements in large loops.

```cpp
void check_bitwise_operations_invariant(int k, int maxN) {
    if (k * maxN > 150000000) {  // Reuse threshold for consistency
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to frequent bitwise operations on large arrays!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

4. **Alternating Conditions in Large Iterative Structures**:
   - Ensure that alternating conditions aren't excessively executed.

```cpp
void check_alternating_conditions_invariant(int k, int maxN) {
    if (k * maxN > 150000000) {  // Reuse threshold for consistency
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to alternating conditions in large loops!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrating the Checks into the Original Program

Now, we will integrate these runtime checks into the original C++ program. We will place them strategically to avoid impacting performance, ensuring they're outside tight loops.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
const int MAXN = 3 * 1e3;

// Function to check the invariant for high k value
void check_high_k_invariant(int k) {
    if (k > 50000) {  // Arbitrary large threshold, considering constraints
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to high k!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Function to check for large range processing
void check_large_range_invariant(int k, int maxN) {
    if (k * maxN > 150000000) {  // Threshold based on observed slowdown
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to large range processing!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Function to check for frequent bitwise operations
void check_bitwise_operations_invariant(int k, int maxN) {
    if (k * maxN > 150000000) {  // Reuse threshold for consistency
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to frequent bitwise operations on large arrays!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Function to check for alternating conditions in large loops
void check_alternating_conditions_invariant(int k, int maxN) {
    if (k * maxN > 150000000) {  // Reuse threshold for consistency
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to alternating conditions in large loops!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    int n, k, x;
    cin >> n >> k >> x;

    // Insert performance checker functions
    check_high_k_invariant(k); // Check for high k value
    check_large_range_invariant(k, MAXN); // Check for large range processing
    check_bitwise_operations_invariant(k, MAXN); // Check for frequent bitwise operations
    check_alternating_conditions_invariant(k, MAXN); // Check for alternating conditions

    vector<int> a(MAXN, 0);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        int z;
        cin >> z;
        a[z]++;
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
        vector<int> b(MAXN, 0);
        bool fl = 0;
        for (int j = 0; j < MAXN; j++) {
            if (a[j] % 2) {
                if (fl) {
                    b[j ^ x] += a[j] / 2;
                    b[j] += a[j] / 2 + 1;
                } else {
                    b[j ^ x] += a[j] / 2 + 1;
                    b[j] += a[j] / 2;
                }
                fl ^= 1;
            } else {
                b[j ^ x] += a[j] / 2;
                b[j] += a[j] / 2;
            }
        }
        a = b;
    }
    for (int i = MAXN - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        if (a[i]) {
            cout << i << " ";
            break;
        }
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < MAXN; i++) {
        if (a[i]) {
            cout << i << " ";
            break;
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation

- Each invariant check is placed right after reading the inputs and before the main performance-critical loops.
- The checks ensure that if any of the identified conditions are met, a warning is printed and the program aborts, allowing for easy detection of performance bottlenecks during testing.
