=== Invariants Response ===
To analyze the performance bottlenecks in the provided C code, let's break down the problem with the provided slow and fast inputs, along with the hit count data.

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Line-level Hit Count Analysis:**
   - **Lines 17-20:** The loop starting at line 17 is hit significantly more often during the slow input compared to the fast input. For the slow input, this loop iterates 652,225 times, whereas for the fast input, it iterates only 17 times.
   - **Reason for High Hit Count:**
     - The loop's high iteration count indicates significant work is being done here, especially as it processes each row from `row+1` to `n`, adjusting the parameter `t` and calculating `ans` based on `t`, `max_l`, and `max_r`.

2. **Impact of Input Constraints:**
   - **Constraints (n â‰¤ 10^9):** The very large value of `n` in the slow input (1,000,000,000) compared to a much smaller `c` implies the need to grow the number of "on" cells until reaching at least `c`.
   - **Binary Search in The Main Function:** The binary search loop refines `mi` to find the minimal number of seconds needed, calling `sum(mi)` frequently. This loop terminates when `sum(mi) >= c`.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the code analysis and the performance characteristics revealed by the hit counts, here are some performance-characterizing invariants:

1. **Expansion Across Large n:**
   - **Invariant:** "If `n` is large, and `row` is near one of the edges, leading to a situation where the loop traverses a large portion of the grid, the computation time will increase significantly."
   - **Explanation:** This captures the scenario where the loop iterates from `row+1` to `n` for vast values of `n`, leading to many unnecessary iterations when `c` is much smaller than `n*n`.

2. **High Iteration Within Loops:**
   - **Invariant:** "When `c` is significantly smaller than `n^2`, the loops within the `sum` function can become bottlenecks, especially when they need to cover nearly the entire grid to incrementally achieve the necessary count of 'on' cells."
   - **Explanation:** This invariant identifies the inefficiency of the loop that needs to iterate over a huge chunk of the grid due to the parameters.

3. **Binary Search Over Large Grid:**
   - **Invariant:** "Binary search will perform poorly when each refinement of `mi` results in a call to `sum` that requires looping through a massive section of the grid controlled by `n` and constrained by `c`."
   - **Explanation:** The overhead of binary search is exacerbated by large `n`, causing unnecessary computational cost when `c` is relatively small.

### Conclusion

To optimize this program, it would be beneficial to avoid unnecessary iterations over large sections of the grid when `n` is significantly larger than `c`. This could include optimizing the loop conditions within the `sum` function or using a more efficient approach to count the needed cells, possibly leveraging symmetry or early stopping conditions when possible.

### Phase 3: Implement the Natural Language Invariants in C++

To implement the performance-characterizing invariants as runtime checks in C++:

1. **Expansion Across Large n:**
   - Check if `n` is excessively large while processing a large range of rows in the loop.

2. **High Iteration Within Loops:**
   - Check if the number of iterations in loops is unnecessarily high when `c` is much smaller than `n^2`.

3. **Binary Search Over Large Grid:**
   - Monitor the binary search loop to detect conditions where the search space is unnecessarily extended due to large `n` or small `c`.

Let's implement these checks:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstdio>

using namespace std;

const int maxN = 1e5;
long long n, row, col, c;

long long sum(long long t) {
    long long max_l = col - 1, max_r = n - col;
    long long ans = 0;
    ans += 1 + min(t, max_l) + min(t, max_r);
    long long aux_t = t;
    for (int i = row - 1; i >= 1; i--) {
        aux_t--;
        if (aux_t < 0) break;
        ans += 1 + min(aux_t, max_l) + min(aux_t, max_r);
    }
    for (int i = row + 1; i <= n; i++) {
        t--;
        if (t < 0) break;
        ans += 1 + min(t, max_l) + min(t, max_r);
    }
    return ans;
}

void check_large_n_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to large n!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_loop_iteration_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to high loop iterations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_binary_search_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered during binary search!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    scanf("%lld %lld", &n, &row);
    scanf("%lld %lld", &col, &c);

    // Check for large n causing inefficiencies in computation
    check_large_n_invariant(n > 1e8);

    long long lo = 0, hi = 1e5;

    while (lo < hi) {
        long long mi = lo + (hi - lo) / 2;

        // Check inefficiencies in loop due to high iteration counts
        check_loop_iteration_invariant(mi > 1e4);

        if (sum(mi) >= c)
            hi = mi;
        else
            lo = mi + 1;
    }

    // Check inefficiencies in binary search due to large n or small c
    check_binary_search_invariant((n * n) > 1e9 && c < (n * n * 0.1));

    printf("%lld\n", hi);
    return 0;
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrate the Checker Code with the Original Program

Here's the final instrumented code, with the checkers implemented in a way that they are placed effectively to avoid overhead in tight loops, while still catching potential performance bottlenecks:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstdio>

using namespace std;

const int maxN = 1e5;
long long n, row, col, c;

long long sum(long long t) {
    long long max_l = col - 1, max_r = n - col;
    long long ans = 0;
    ans += 1 + min(t, max_l) + min(t, max_r);
    long long aux_t = t;
    for (int i = row - 1; i >= 1; i--) {
        aux_t--;
        if (aux_t < 0) break;
        ans += 1 + min(aux_t, max_l) + min(aux_t, max_r);
    }
    for (int i = row + 1; i <= n; i++) {
        t--;
        if (t < 0) break;
        ans += 1 + min(t, max_l) + min(t, max_r);
    }
    return ans;
}

void check_large_n_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to large n!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_loop_iteration_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to high loop iterations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_binary_search_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered during binary search!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    scanf("%lld %lld", &n, &row);
    scanf("%lld %lld", &col, &c);

    // Check for large n causing inefficiencies in computation
    check_large_n_invariant(n > 1e8);

    long long lo = 0, hi = 1e5;

    while (lo < hi) {
        long long mi = lo + (hi - lo) / 2;

        // Check inefficiencies in loop due to high iteration counts
        check_loop_iteration_invariant(mi > 1e4);

        if (sum(mi) >= c)
            hi = mi;
        else
            lo = mi + 1;
    }

    // Check inefficiencies in binary search due to large n or small c
    check_binary_search_invariant((n * n) > 1e9 && c < (n * n * 0.1));

    printf("%lld\n", hi);
    return 0;
}
```

The code now includes runtime checks that will identify when the performance bottlenecks identified can potentially be triggered, with appropriate messages and program exits to alert developers or testers during execution. This setup will be useful for debugging purposes and ensuring that future changes to input data or changes in problem constraints do not silently degrade performance.
