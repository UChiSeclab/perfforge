=== Invariants Response ===
To diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input, let's go through the analysis as outlined in the tasks.

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Compare Line-level Hit Counts:**
   - Line 17 (`for (int i = row + 1; i <= n; i++)`) and subsequent lines within this loop (lines 18-20) are executed significantly more times in the slow input compared to the fast input. Specifically, line 17 is hit 1,594,329 times for the slow input but only 20 times for the fast input.

2. **Pinpoint Lines or Functions Significantly More Hits:**
   - The `sum` function itself (line 7) is called 20 times for both inputs, but the loop starting at line 17 is the hotspot during the slow run.
   - The loop from lines 17 to 21 is the main contributor to the high execution time for the slow input, as it iterates over a large range driven by the value of `n`, which is very large in the case of the slow input.

3. **Infer Interaction with Data Structures and Input Constraints:**
   - The loop's range depends on the initial position `row` and the grid size `n`; when `n` is large, the loop iterates many times, particularly if `row` is near the start of the range.
   - As `n` is extremely large (up to \(10^9\)), this loop potentially iterates a huge number of times, limited by `t`.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **Generate Natural Language Statements:**
   - When the grid size `n` is large and the initial row position `row` is near the beginning or the end of the grid, the program takes significantly longer due to extensive iterations over the grid.
   - If the target number of lit cells `c` is close to \(n^2\), the computation requires checking many cells, leading to a longer execution time.

2. **Abstract Categories or Thresholds:**
   - "When the grid size `n` is large, particularly close to its upper constraint, and the initial lit cell is positioned near one of the boundaries of the grid, the program may take significantly longer to compute the result."

3. **Correlate Conditions to Input Patterns:**
   - "If the initial position is such that the breadth of the lit region grows over a large number of rows or columns (e.g., when `row` or `col` is near the grid edge), performance can degrade due to the extensive loop operations required to meet the condition `c`."

4. **Avoid Hardcoding and Focus on Fuzzer Utility:**
   - The invariant checks should be broad and based on the conceptual understanding of constraints rather than specific numeric values from inputs.

### Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **Invariant 1: Large Grid Size with Edge Starting Position**
   - "When `n` is large and the initial lit cell is positioned near the edges of the grid, the number of operations required can grow significantly due to extensive iterations, causing performance to degrade."

2. **Invariant 2: High Target `c` Relative to Grid Size**
   - "If `c` is high relative to the grid size, specifically when it's a substantial fraction of `n^2`, the grid iteration and lit cell expansion may result in a longer computation time."

3. **Invariant 3: Iterative Growth Across the Grid**
   - "When the loop in the `sum` function needs to iterate across a large number of rows or columns, performance will degrade, especially if this is required to meet a high target `c`."

These invariants take into account the relationship between the input parameters and the conditions under which the program's performance deteriorates, ensuring they are general enough to apply to a wide range of similar scenarios.

=== Checker Response ===
Let's begin with Phase 3, where we translate the performance-characterizing invariants into C++ code snippets that check the conditions at runtime.

### Phase 3: Implement Performance-Characterizing Invariants in C++

Based on the natural language invariants derived earlier, here's how you can implement them as runtime checks in C++:

1. **Invariant 1: Large Grid Size with Edge Starting Position**
   - This invariant checks if the grid size `n` is large and the initial position is near the grid's boundaries, which can lead to extensive iterations.

```cpp
void check_large_grid_with_edge_start(long long n, long long row, long long col) {
    if (n > 1e8 && (row <= 10 || row >= n-10 || col <= 10 || col >= n-10)) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large grid with edge start!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

2. **Invariant 2: High Target `c` Relative to Grid Size**
   - This invariant checks if `c` is high relative to the grid size `n`, specifically when it approaches a substantial fraction of `n^2`.

```cpp
void check_high_target_c(long long n, long long c) {
    if (c > 0.9 * n * n) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high target c relative to grid size!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

3. **Invariant 3: Iterative Growth Across the Grid**
   - This invariant checks for potential performance issues when the loop in the `sum` function iterates over a large number of rows or columns.

```cpp
void check_iterative_growth(long long n, long long row, long long col) {
    if (n > 1e8 && (row <= 10 || row >= n-10 || col <= 10 || col >= n-10)) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - iterative growth across the grid!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrate Checker Code into the Original Program

Now we will integrate these checks into the provided solution code. We'll place these checks after reading the input but before the heavy computation starts.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
const int INF = 0x3f3f3f3f;
const long long LLINF = 1e18;
const int maxN = 1e5;
long long n, row, col, c;

// Checker functions
void check_large_grid_with_edge_start(long long n, long long row, long long col) {
    if (n > 1e8 && (row <= 10 || row >= n-10 || col <= 10 || col >= n-10)) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large grid with edge start!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_high_target_c(long long n, long long c) {
    if (c > 0.9 * n * n) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high target c relative to grid size!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

long long sum(long long t) {
    long long max_l = col - 1, max_r = n - col;
    long long ans = 0;
    ans += 1 + min(t, max_l) + min(t, max_r);
    long long aux_t = t;
    for (int i = row - 1; i >= 1; i--) {
        aux_t--;
        if (aux_t < 0) break;
        ans += 1 + min(aux_t, max_l) + min(aux_t, max_r);
    }
    for (int i = row + 1; i <= n; i++) {
        t--;
        if (t < 0) break;
        ans += 1 + min(t, max_l) + min(t, max_r);
    }
    return ans;
}

int main() {
    scanf("%lld %lld", &n, &row);
    scanf("%lld %lld", &col, &c);

    // Insert performance checks here
    check_large_grid_with_edge_start(n, row, col);
    check_high_target_c(n, c);

    long long lo = 0, hi = 1e6;
    while (lo < hi) {
        long long mi = lo + (hi - lo) / 2;
        if (sum(mi) >= c)
            hi = mi;
        else
            lo = mi + 1;
    }
    printf("%lld\n", hi);
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

- **Check Placement**: The checks are placed after the input is read but before any heavy computations. This allows us to catch potential performance problems based on the input characteristics.
- **Abort on Trigger**: The program will terminate with a warning if any of the performance bottleneck conditions are met, helping identify scenarios that degrade performance.
