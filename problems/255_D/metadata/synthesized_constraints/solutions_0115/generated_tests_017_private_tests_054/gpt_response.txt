=== Invariants Response ===
To diagnose the slowness in the program when executed with the slow input versus the fast input, we will conduct an analysis based on the hit count information and the structure of the given C program. The objective is to determine performance-characterizing invariants that describe when and why the program experiences slow execution.

### Phase 1: Identifying Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Line-level Hit Count Comparison**:
   - The hit counts for the function `pintados` (line 4) are substantially higher for the slow input compared to the fast input. 
   - Notably, the hit counts for loops in lines 7 and 29 are significantly higher in the slow input, with the loop on line 29 hitting over 1 million times for the slow input but only 4 times for the fast input. 

2. **Analysis of Expensive Segments**:
   - The loops iterating over a range determined by `x ± segundos` (lines 7-11 and 29-35) are heavily hit due to the large value of `n` in the slow input.
   - The problem arises when these loops handle a large number of iterations, which is exacerbated by the vast size of `n` causing extensive iteration over grid positions.

### Phase 2: Deriving Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **Invariant Descriptions**:
   - **Invariant 1**: "If the grid size `n` is extremely large, and the number of switched-on cells `c` is also large, the program may enter a slow path due to extensive iterations over grid positions."
   - **Invariant 2**: "When the initial position of the switched-on cell (`x`, `y`) is near the grid boundary and the required count `c` needs a substantial spread across the grid, the program may slow down due to boundary checks and extensive loop iterations."
   - **Invariant 3**: "The program could slow down when the calculation involves a large number of grid positions (`n` being large), especially if the required number of active cells `c` is close to the total possible cells, leading to high iteration counts."

2. **Threshold Suggestions**:
   - Given the problem constraints (`1 ≤ n, c ≤ 10^9` and `c ≤ n^2`), these invariants are designed to apply in scenarios where both `n` and `c` are large, particularly when `c` approaches `n^2`.
   - The performance issues are strongly correlated with the high grid size and the number of active cells required, leading to potentially long-running loops.

### Final Considerations:
- Avoiding hardcoded values, the focus is on high `n` and `c` values as common contributors to slow execution.
- Checks for performance issues should be outside of critical loops to avoid further degrading performance.
- These invariants provide guidance for when the program is likely to slow down, helping in optimization or refactoring efforts.

This analysis targets optimizing the interaction between data structure sizes and loop execution given the input constraints, thus aiming to mitigate performance bottlenecks effectively.

### Phase 3: Implementing Invariants as Checker Code in C++

Below are the checker functions corresponding to the performance-characterizing invariants derived in natural language.

```cpp
// Checker for Invariant 1: Large grid size 'n' and large 'c'.
void check_grid_size_invariant(long long n, long long c) {
    if (n > 1e8 && c > 1e8) { // Example threshold, consider large sizes for both n and c
        cerr << "Warning: grid_size_invariant triggered - large grid size and required active cells." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Checker for Invariant 2: Initial cell near boundary and large 'c'.
void check_boundary_invariant(long long x, long long y, long long n, long long c) {
    if ((x <= 2 || x >= n-1 || y <= 2 || y >= n-1) && c > 1e8) { // Near boundary and large 'c'
        cerr << "Warning: boundary_invariant triggered - initial cell near boundary with large c." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Checker for Invariant 3: Large number of cells to be switched on.
void check_active_cells_invariant(long long n, long long c) {
    if (c > 0.9 * n * n) { // Large proportion of cells to be activated
        cerr << "Warning: active_cells_invariant triggered - high number of active cells required." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrating Checkers into the Original C++ Program

Now, we will integrate these checks into the original program at effective points to catch performance issues early.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

long long n, x, y, c;

long long pintados(long long segundos) {
    long long pos, aArriba = 0, aAbajo = 0, contador = 0;
    bool arriba = true, abajo = true;
    for (pos = x - segundos; pos < 1; ++pos) {
        if (y + aAbajo == n) abajo = false;
        if (y - aArriba == 1) arriba = false;
        if (abajo) ++aAbajo;
        if (arriba) ++aArriba;
    }
    for (pos; pos <= x && pos <= n; ++pos) {
        contador += aAbajo + aArriba + 1;
        if (contador < 0) return INT_MAX;
        if (y + aAbajo == n) abajo = false;
        if (y - aArriba == 1) arriba = false;
        if (abajo) ++aAbajo;
        if (arriba) ++aArriba;
    }
    aArriba = aAbajo = 0;
    arriba = abajo = true;
    for (pos = x + segundos; pos > n; --pos) {
        if (y + aAbajo == n) abajo = false;
        if (y - aArriba == 1) arriba = false;
        if (abajo) ++aAbajo;
        if (arriba) ++aArriba;
    }
    for (pos; pos > x; --pos) {
        contador += aAbajo + aArriba + 1;
        if (contador < 0) return INT_MAX;
        if (y + aAbajo == n) abajo = false;
        if (y - aArriba == 1) arriba = false;
        if (abajo) ++aAbajo;
        if (arriba) ++aArriba;
    }
    return contador;
}

long long buscar() {
    long long izq = 0, der = min((long long)2e5, n * 2), centro;
    while (izq <= der) {
        centro = (der - izq) / 2 + izq;
        long long segundos = pintados(centro), ant = pintados(centro - 1);
        if (segundos >= c && ant < c) return centro;
        if (segundos < c)
            izq = centro + 1;
        else
            der = centro - 1;
    }
}

int main() {
    cin >> n >> x >> y >> c;

    // Insert performance checkers after reading inputs
    check_grid_size_invariant(n, c);  // Check for large grid size and required active cells
    check_boundary_invariant(x, y, n, c);  // Check for initial cell near boundary with large 'c'
    check_active_cells_invariant(n, c);  // Check for high number of active cells required

    cout << buscar() << '\n';
}
```

### Explanation of Integration

- **Checker `check_grid_size_invariant`**: Ensures that the program does not proceed when both `n` and `c` are exceedingly large, which can lead to slow execution.
  
- **Checker `check_boundary_invariant`**: Ensures that performance issues are flagged when the initial active cell is near the grid boundary and a large number of cells need to be activated.

- **Checker `check_active_cells_invariant`**: Triggers when the required active cells `c` are a very high proportion of the total grid cells, indicating potential for slow execution due to extensive iterations.

By placing these checks immediately after the input is read, we avoid introducing overhead in the main computational loops, thus ensuring our performance checks are efficient.
