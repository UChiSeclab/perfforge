### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

Based on the hit count data provided, we can identify the following segments of code as being particularly expensive or inefficient:

1. **Nested Loops:**
   - The loop on line 17 (`for (j = 1; j <= k; j++)`) and the subsequent nested loop on line 25 (`for (p = 1; p <= k - j; p++)`) have significantly high hit counts when compared to the fast input. This suggests they are iterating many times for each input query, particularly under conditions presented by the slow input.

2. **Conditionals and Calculations:**
   - The conditions and calculations on lines 24-27 (`F = Q - (j * a[i])` and the conditional checking in line 27) are heavily hit, indicating they play a crucial role in the repeated operation within the nested loops.

3. **Use of `lower_bound`:**
   - Lines 19 and 26 involve calls to `lower_bound`, which may lead to inefficiencies if called frequently within nested loops, especially with larger ranges of calculations.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the above analysis, we can derive the following performance-characterizing invariants:

1. **Invariant on the Number of Denominations:**
   - "When the number of bill denominations is minimal (e.g., n = 1), the program becomes inefficient due to exhaustive combinations attempted to reach the withdrawal sum."

2. **Invariant on Large Withdrawal Requests:**
   - "If each requested withdrawal amount is substantially large compared to the available denominations, the program may enter a slow path as it attempts many possible combinations using the available bills."

3. **Invariant on Repeated Operations:**
   - "When `k` is large, the nested loops iterate extensively, causing performance degradation. The code's performance decreases notably when attempting to satisfy large withdrawal amounts using very few bill types, requiring exhaustive combinations."

These invariants highlight scenarios where the complexity of finding the minimum number of bills becomes impractically high, leading to potential slowdowns. They focus on input patterns and constraints (like `k` and `n`) that can trigger inefficient paths in the code execution, ensuring that they are applicable to a range of future scenarios within the given constraints.

### Phase 3: Implement the Natural Language Invariants as Runtime Checks in C++

Based on the performance-characterizing invariants previously derived, here are the C++ checks:

1. **Invariant on the Number of Denominations:**
   - C++ Code: Checking if there is only one denomination, as this would lead to inefficient computation due to lack of variety in bill combinations.

```cpp
void check_single_denomination_invariant(int n) {
    if (n == 1) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - single denomination." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

2. **Invariant on Large Withdrawal Requests:**
   - C++ Code: Checking if withdrawal requests are significantly larger than the maximum denomination, leading to inefficient attempts to match the sum.

```cpp
void check_large_withdrawal_invariant(long long Q, long long max_den, int n) {
    if (Q > max_den * n) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - withdrawal amount too large compared to bill denominations." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

3. **Invariant on Repeated Operations:**
   - C++ Code: Checking for large `k` and emphasizing the nested loops' potential inefficiency.

```cpp
void check_large_k_invariant(int k) {
    if (k > 15) { // Assuming a threshold based on problem constraints
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large k value leading to extensive loops." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrate the Checks into the Original Program

Here is the instrumented C++ code with the checks integrated at appropriate points:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
long long a[5010];
vector<long long> v;

// Performance check functions
void check_single_denomination_invariant(int n) {
    if (n == 1) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - single denomination." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_large_withdrawal_invariant(long long Q, long long max_den, int n) {
    if (Q > max_den * n) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - withdrawal amount too large compared to bill denominations." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_large_k_invariant(int k) {
    if (k > 15) { // Assuming a threshold based on problem constraints
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large k value leading to extensive loops." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    int n, i, k, q, j, co = 0, y, p;
    long long Q, F, Answer;
    cin >> n >> k;
    
    check_single_denomination_invariant(n);
    check_large_k_invariant(k);

    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        scanf("%I64d", &a[i]);
    }

    cin >> q;
    while (q--) {
        scanf("%I64d", &Q);

        check_large_withdrawal_invariant(Q, a[n-1], n);

        Answer = -1;
        for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (j = 1; j <= k; j++) {
                if (j == 1) {
                    y = lower_bound(a, a + n, Q) - &a[0];
                    if (a[y] == Q) {
                        Answer = 1;
                    }
                }
                F = Q - (j * a[i]);
                for (p = 1; p <= k - j; p++) {
                    y = lower_bound(a, a + n, F / p) - &a[0];
                    if (p * a[y] == F && (j + p < Answer || Answer == -1)) Answer = p + j;
                }
            }
        }
        v.push_back(Answer);
    }
    
    for (j = 0; j < v.size(); j++) cout << v[j] << "\n";
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of Check Placement:

- **`check_single_denomination_invariant`:** Placed after reading `n` to immediately catch if there's only one denomination.
- **`check_large_withdrawal_invariant`:** Called for each withdrawal request, ensuring it doesn't exceed feasible limits given the denominations.
- **`check_large_k_invariant`:** Placed after reading `k` to immediately flag potential inefficiency related to the number of bills.

These checks help maintain efficient performance by detecting and aborting on situations known to lead to slow execution.
