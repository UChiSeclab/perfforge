system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

ATMs of a well-known bank of a small country are arranged so that they can not give any amount of money requested by the user. Due to the limited size of the bill dispenser (the device that is directly giving money from an ATM) and some peculiarities of the ATM structure, you can get at most k bills from it, and the bills may be of at most two distinct denominations.

For example, if a country uses bills with denominations 10, 50, 100, 500, 1000 and 5000 burles, then at k = 20 such ATM can give sums 100 000 burles and 96 000 burles, but it cannot give sums 99 000 and 101 000 burles.

Let's suppose that the country uses bills of n distinct denominations, and the ATM that you are using has an unlimited number of bills of each type. You know that during the day you will need to withdraw a certain amount of cash q times. You know that when the ATM has multiple ways to give money, it chooses the one which requires the minimum number of bills, or displays an error message if it cannot be done. Determine the result of each of the q of requests for cash withdrawal.

Input

The first line contains two integers n, k (1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, 1 ≤ k ≤ 20).

The next line contains n space-separated integers ai (1 ≤ ai ≤ 107) — the denominations of the bills that are used in the country. Numbers ai follow in the strictly increasing order.

The next line contains integer q (1 ≤ q ≤ 20) — the number of requests for cash withdrawal that you will make.

The next q lines contain numbers xi (1 ≤ xi ≤ 2·108) — the sums of money in burles that you are going to withdraw from the ATM.

Output

For each request for cash withdrawal print on a single line the minimum number of bills it can be done, or print  - 1, if it is impossible to get the corresponding sum.

assistant: To diagnose the performance bottlenecks and derive conditions under which the code slows down, we need to follow these steps:

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Hit Count Analysis:**
   - **Key Lines with Higher Hits in Slow Input:**
     - `line 24 (for loop over k2)`: slow hit count 209, fast hit count 210
     - `line 26 (sum /= k2)`: slow hit count 120, fast hit count 56
     - `line 27 (if condition checking sum validity)`: slow hit count 120, fast hit count 56
     - `line 28 (updating ans)`: slow hit count 19, fast hit count 0

2. **Inference:**
   - The inner loop (lines 24-29) executing over `k2` is particularly expensive, especially since it is nested within another loop over `k1` (lines 16-32).
   - The continued calculation and checking of `sum` (line 26 and 27) suggest repeated recalculations, particularly when `sum` is large relative to `k2` and `k1`.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **Invariant Statements:**

   - **High Denomination Bills:**
     - Natural Language: "When the available denominations are very large compared to the withdrawal amount requested, the code may perform excessive calculations due to numerous attempts to combine these denominations."
     - This scenario aligns with inputs where the denomination (`ai`) is significantly larger than the target withdrawal (`x`).

   - **Inefficient Denomination Combination:**
     - Natural Language: "If the ATM is trying to fulfill requests using large denominations with tight constraints on the number of bills, the combinations attempted may become inefficient, leading to excessive checks."
     - This reflects cases where the highest denomination is always used first, causing many recalculations of the remaining amount (`sum`).

   - **Recursive Denomination Subtraction:**
     - Natural Language: "When repeatedly subtracting large bill denominations from the target sum, the algorithm can spiral into many iterations without finding a valid solution, particularly if the problem size (n) is small."
     - This corresponds to scenarios where `n` is smaller, causing limited denomination choices for fulfilling `x`.

2. **General Triggers:**
   - When `n` is small (close to 1) and the single denomination is much larger than `x`.
   - When the difference between the highest and lowest denomination is vast, leading to fewer viable combinations to reach `x`.

3. **Potential Future Conditions:**
   - For any future inputs, if the requested sum (`x`) requires using a large number of bills (`k` close to its maximum value) and the available denominations are not well-suited to the target, similar slowdowns may be observed.

These invariants aim to capture broad conditions that likely lead to the performance issues observed, covering both current and future scenarios within the problem's constraints.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
ATMs of a well-known bank of a small country are arranged so that they can not give any amount of money requested by the user. Due to the limited size of the bill dispenser (the device that is directly giving money from an ATM) and some peculiarities of the ATM structure, you can get at most k bills from it, and the bills may be of at most two distinct denominations.

For example, if a country uses bills with denominations 10, 50, 100, 500, 1000 and 5000 burles, then at k = 20 such ATM can give sums 100 000 burles and 96 000 burles, but it cannot give sums 99 000 and 101 000 burles.

Let's suppose that the country uses bills of n distinct denominations, and the ATM that you are using has an unlimited number of bills of each type. You know that during the day you will need to withdraw a certain amount of cash q times. You know that when the ATM has multiple ways to give money, it chooses the one which requires the minimum number of bills, or displays an error message if it cannot be done. Determine the result of each of the q of requests for cash withdrawal.

Input

The first line contains two integers n, k (1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, 1 ≤ k ≤ 20).

The next line contains n space-separated integers ai (1 ≤ ai ≤ 107) — the denominations of the bills that are used in the country. Numbers ai follow in the strictly increasing order.

The next line contains integer q (1 ≤ q ≤ 20) — the number of requests for cash withdrawal that you will make.

The next q lines contain numbers xi (1 ≤ xi ≤ 2·108) — the sums of money in burles that you are going to withdraw from the ATM.

Output

For each request for cash withdrawal print on a single line the minimum number of bills it can be done, or print  - 1, if it is impossible to get the corresponding sum.

assistant: ## Phase 3: Implementing Performance Checkers in C++

Based on the performance-characterizing invariants we derived previously, here are the C++ code snippets for runtime checks:

1. **High Denomination Bills:**
   ```cpp
   void check_high_denomination_invariant(const vector<int>& a, int x) {
       if (a.size() == 1 && a[0] > x) {
           cerr << "Warning: High denomination invariant triggered - denomination too large for target sum" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Inefficient Denomination Combination:**
   ```cpp
   void check_inefficient_combination_invariant(const vector<int>& a, int k) {
       if (a.size() == 1 && k > 15) { // Threshold chosen based on typical limits for inefficiency
           cerr << "Warning: Inefficient combination invariant triggered - high k with single large denomination" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Recursive Denomination Subtraction:**
   ```cpp
   void check_recursive_subtraction_invariant(int n, const vector<int>& a, int x) {
       if (n <= 2 && a.back() > x / 2) { // Checking if using largest denomination exceeds half of the target
           cerr << "Warning: Recursive subtraction invariant triggered - limited denominations with large values" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

## Phase 4: Integrating Checkers into the Program

Now, let's integrate these checks into the original C++ code. They will be strategically placed right after reading the input and before entering computationally expensive loops.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

const long long inf = 1000000000ll;
const long long inf64 = inf * inf;

void check_high_denomination_invariant(const vector<int>& a, int x) {
    if (a.size() == 1 && a[0] > x) {
        cerr << "Warning: High denomination invariant triggered - denomination too large for target sum" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_inefficient_combination_invariant(const vector<int>& a, int k) {
    if (a.size() == 1 && k > 15) {
        cerr << "Warning: Inefficient combination invariant triggered - high k with single large denomination" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_recursive_subtraction_invariant(int n, const vector<int>& a, int x) {
    if (n <= 2 && a.back() > x / 2) {
        cerr << "Warning: Recursive subtraction invariant triggered - limited denominations with large values" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

bool solve() {
    int n, k, q, sz = -1, x;
    scanf("%d%d", &n, &k);
    vector<int> a(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) scanf("%d", &a[i]), sz = max(sz, a[i] + 1);
    
    // Runtime checks
    check_inefficient_combination_invariant(a, k);
    
    vector<int> is(sz);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) is[a[i]] = 1;
    scanf("%d", &q);
    
    while (q--) {
        scanf("%d", &x);
        
        // Runtime checks
        check_high_denomination_invariant(a, x);
        check_recursive_subtraction_invariant(n, a, x);
        
        int ans = inf;
        for (int k1 = 1; k1 <= k; k1++) {
            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                long long sum = a[i] * k1;
                if (sum > x) continue;
                if (sum == x)
                    ans = min(ans, k1);
                else {
                    sum = x - sum;
                    for (int k2 = 1; k1 + k2 <= k; k2++) {
                        if (sum % k2) continue;
                        sum /= k2;
                        if (sum >= 0 && sum < (int)is.size() && is[sum])
                            ans = min(ans, k1 + k2);
                        sum *= k2;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        if (ans != inf)
            printf("%d\n", ans);
        else
            puts("-1");
    }
    return true;
}

int main() {
    solve();
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Check Placement**: The checks are placed after reading inputs and before any heavy computation begins.
- **Performance Checkers**: These checks help detect conditions where performance degradation is likely, aborting the program to alert about these potential bottlenecks.
