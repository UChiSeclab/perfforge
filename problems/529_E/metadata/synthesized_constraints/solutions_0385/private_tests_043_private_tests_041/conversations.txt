system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

ATMs of a well-known bank of a small country are arranged so that they can not give any amount of money requested by the user. Due to the limited size of the bill dispenser (the device that is directly giving money from an ATM) and some peculiarities of the ATM structure, you can get at most k bills from it, and the bills may be of at most two distinct denominations.

For example, if a country uses bills with denominations 10, 50, 100, 500, 1000 and 5000 burles, then at k = 20 such ATM can give sums 100 000 burles and 96 000 burles, but it cannot give sums 99 000 and 101 000 burles.

Let's suppose that the country uses bills of n distinct denominations, and the ATM that you are using has an unlimited number of bills of each type. You know that during the day you will need to withdraw a certain amount of cash q times. You know that when the ATM has multiple ways to give money, it chooses the one which requires the minimum number of bills, or displays an error message if it cannot be done. Determine the result of each of the q of requests for cash withdrawal.

Input

The first line contains two integers n, k (1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, 1 ≤ k ≤ 20).

The next line contains n space-separated integers ai (1 ≤ ai ≤ 107) — the denominations of the bills that are used in the country. Numbers ai follow in the strictly increasing order.

The next line contains integer q (1 ≤ q ≤ 20) — the number of requests for cash withdrawal that you will make.

The next q lines contain numbers xi (1 ≤ xi ≤ 2·108) — the sums of money in burles that you are going to withdraw from the ATM.

Output

For each request for cash withdrawal print on a single line the minimum number of bills it can be done, or print  - 1, if it is impossible to get the corresponding sum.

assistant: ## Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Comparison of Hit Counts**:
   - Key function `f` shows significantly higher hit counts on slow input, particularly lines 13-28, which involve searching logic.

2. **Significant Lines**:
   - **Binary Search Loops**: Lines 17-22 and 26-31 indicate repeated binary search operations.
   - **Outer Loop**: Lines 62-81 within the `main` function indicate a nested iteration over a vector `v`, which is influenced by binary search results.

3. **Data Structure Interaction**:
   - The vector `v` is generated with combinations of denominations and their multiples, leading to a search space dependent on `n` and `k`.
   - The `f` function performs binary searches over `v`, which becomes expensive when `v` is large.

4. **Constraints**:
   - The slow input produces many permutations in `v` due to a single denomination being used up to `k` times, making the vector size directly proportional to `k` and requiring multiple binary searches per query.

## Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **Invariant 1**: 
   - **Description**: "If the number of requests `q` is large, and involves repeated binary searches over a large vector constructed from denominations, the program may demonstrate slow performance."
   - **Rationale**: This is evident from the repeated search operations for each request, especially when `n` or `k` increases the size of the vector `v`.

2. **Invariant 2**:
   - **Description**: "When the vector of denominations multiplied by their allowed counts grows large due to high values of `k`, the repeated checks and comparisons can degrade performance."
   - **Rationale**: The vector `v` can grow substantially with combinations of `n` denominations and `k` counts, leading to repeated binary search overhead.

3. **Invariant 3**:
   - **Description**: "If the difference between requested sums is small and close to multiples of a single denomination, the program may repeatedly use a heavy function to attempt mismatched sums, causing delays."
   - **Rationale**: The slow input shows that minor variations in withdrawal amounts, especially around large numbers like 200 million, trigger repeated ineffective searches and attempts to match sums.

4. **Invariant 4**:
   - **Description**: "If the vector used for computation is sorted with high repetitive overhead due to multiple denominations being tested with maximum multipliers, performance will degrade."
   - **Rationale**: The sort operation on `v` (line 59) can become substantial with growing permutations, causing performance hits on large input scenarios.

These invariants outline the conditions under which the given program is likely to experience performance slowdowns, emphasizing combinations of high `k`, large `n`, and repeated search operations on large constructed vectors.

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
ATMs of a well-known bank of a small country are arranged so that they can not give any amount of money requested by the user. Due to the limited size of the bill dispenser (the device that is directly giving money from an ATM) and some peculiarities of the ATM structure, you can get at most k bills from it, and the bills may be of at most two distinct denominations.

For example, if a country uses bills with denominations 10, 50, 100, 500, 1000 and 5000 burles, then at k = 20 such ATM can give sums 100 000 burles and 96 000 burles, but it cannot give sums 99 000 and 101 000 burles.

Let's suppose that the country uses bills of n distinct denominations, and the ATM that you are using has an unlimited number of bills of each type. You know that during the day you will need to withdraw a certain amount of cash q times. You know that when the ATM has multiple ways to give money, it chooses the one which requires the minimum number of bills, or displays an error message if it cannot be done. Determine the result of each of the q of requests for cash withdrawal.

Input

The first line contains two integers n, k (1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, 1 ≤ k ≤ 20).

The next line contains n space-separated integers ai (1 ≤ ai ≤ 107) — the denominations of the bills that are used in the country. Numbers ai follow in the strictly increasing order.

The next line contains integer q (1 ≤ q ≤ 20) — the number of requests for cash withdrawal that you will make.

The next q lines contain numbers xi (1 ≤ xi ≤ 2·108) — the sums of money in burles that you are going to withdraw from the ATM.

Output

For each request for cash withdrawal print on a single line the minimum number of bills it can be done, or print  - 1, if it is impossible to get the corresponding sum.

### Explanation of Inserted Checks:

1. **Check 1** (`check_query_and_vector_invariant`): This function checks if a large number of queries `q` coupled with a large vector size `v` may cause performance issues. It is placed after populating `v` but before sorting or using it extensively.

2. **Check 2** (`check_large_vector_invariant`): This function ensures that the vector size, based on the product of `n` and `k`, does not grow excessively large, operational before populating `v`.

3. **Check 3** (`check_repeated_search_invariant`): This function checks if there might be repeated ineffective searches due to the combination of query sizes and the largest denomination. It is placed after reading all input values and before processing queries.
