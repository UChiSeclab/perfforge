=== Invariants Response ===
To analyze the provided C program and derive performance-characterizing invariants, we need to understand the differences between the fast and slow paths in terms of execution.

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Identify the Bottleneck**:
   - **High Hit Count**: The `Exists` function and its loop have significantly more hits in the slow input compared to the fast input. This indicates that the binary search logic within `Exists` is heavily utilized.
   - **Nested Loops**: The loops from lines 50 to 62, especially the combination of the loops on lines 50, 51, and 53, are highly convoluted and are contributing to the slowdown due to repeated searches and checks.
   - **Possible Inefficiency**: The checks for possible combinations of bill denominations seem to be exhaustive, leading to repeated calls to the `Exists` function.

2. **Data Structure Interaction**:
   - The `Buckets` array is populated with combinations of denominations. The binary search (`Exists`) is called to check combinations of these bucket values.
   - The complexity grows as more combinations are checked inefficiently, especially when the input allows for many such combinations without early exits.

3. **Constraints and Loops**:
   - Given `k` can be up to 20 and `n` can be up to 5000, the nested loops iterating over these values can lead to a high number of iterations, especially evident with the slow input where `n` is 1 and `k` is 20.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the above observations, the conditions that likely lead to slowdowns can be characterized as follows:

1. **Excessive Combination Checks**:
   - **Invariant**: "When the number of bill denominations (`n`) is small, but the maximum number of bills (`k`) allowed is large, the program performs excessive checks for combinations, especially if the requested amount (`money`) is just beyond what can be easily achieved with a minimal number of bills."
   - **Why**: The small `n` leads to limited denomination choices, causing the program to attempt many combinations of a few denominations up to `k` times, resulting in a significantly large number of checks.

2. **Repeated Binary Searches**:
   - **Invariant**: "If there are repeated calls to check for possible sums using binary search across multiple bucket lists (`Exists` function), performance may degrade significantly, especially when `k` is large."
   - **Why**: Each call to `Exists` performs a binary search, and when these are combined with nested loops, the overhead becomes substantial.

3. **Ineffective Early Exit**:
   - **Invariant**: "The current logic does not effectively exit early when an optimal solution is found or deemed unattainable, especially when combinations exceed reasonable constraints given `k`."
   - **Why**: The code continues to check combinations even when a minimal solution's threshold (`ans`) could have been set earlier, causing unnecessary processing.

To summarize, the key performance issues stem from the combination of small denomination counts with large bill limits and the exhaustive approach of checking every possible combination without effective pruning or early exit strategies. These inefficiencies are amplified under certain input configurations, leading to the slow performance observed with the slow input.

=== Checker Response ===
Below are the implementations of the performance-characterizing invariants in C++. I have broken down each phase for clarity:

### Phase 3: Implementing Checker Code in C++

```cpp
#include <iostream>

void check_excessive_combination_checks(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        std::cerr << "Warning: excessive combination checks - small n, large k" << std::endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_repeated_binary_searches(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        std::cerr << "Warning: repeated binary searches - high usage of Exists function" << std::endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_ineffective_early_exit(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        std::cerr << "Warning: ineffective early exit - unnecessary processing continues" << std::endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrating Checkers into the Original Program

Here is the instrumented C++ code with checkers integrated at appropriate points:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int n, k;
int nums[5001];
vector<int> Buckets[21];

bool Exists(int num, int b) {
    int l = 0, r = (int)Buckets[b].size() - 1, mid;
    while (l <= r) {
        mid = (l + r) / 2;
        if (Buckets[b][mid] == num)
            return true;
        else if (Buckets[b][mid] > num) {
            r = mid - 1;
        } else {
            l = mid + 1;
        }
    }
    return false;
}

// Checker functions
void check_excessive_combination_checks(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: excessive combination checks - small n, large k" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_repeated_binary_searches(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: repeated binary searches - high usage of Exists function" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_ineffective_early_exit(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: ineffective early exit - unnecessary processing continues" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    int i, j, in;
    int money;
    int test;
    int need;
    int ans;
    int q;
    scanf("%d %d", &n, &k);
    for (i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        scanf("%d", &nums[i]);
    }
    for (i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        for (j = 1; j <= k; j++) {
            Buckets[j].push_back(j * nums[i]);
        }
    }
    for (i = 1; i <= k; i++) {
        sort(Buckets[i].begin(), Buckets[i].end());
    }
    scanf("%d", &q);

    // Check for excessive combination checks
    check_excessive_combination_checks(n < 10 && k > 10); 

    for (test = 1; test <= q; test++) {
        scanf("%d", &money);
        ans = 999;
        for (i = 1; i <= k; i++) {
            for (j = 0; j < Buckets[i].size(); j++) {
                if (Buckets[i][j] == money) {
                    if (ans > i) ans = i;
                }
            }
        }

        // Check for repeated binary searches
        int binarySearchCalls = 0;

        for (i = 1; i <= k; i++) {
            for (j = 1; j <= k; j++) {
                if (i + j >= ans) continue;
                for (in = 0; in < Buckets[i].size(); in++) {
                    need = money - Buckets[i][in];
                    if (need < 0) continue;
                    if (Exists(need, j)) {
                        ans = i + j;
                        binarySearchCalls++;
                        break;
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        // Assuming 1000 is a threshold for excessive binary search calls
        check_repeated_binary_searches(binarySearchCalls > 1000);

        if (ans > k) ans = -1;
        printf("%d\n", ans);
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of Integration

1. **Excessive Combination Checks**: 
   - The check `check_excessive_combination_checks(n < 10 && k > 10);` is placed after the inputs are read. It triggers if there is a small number of denominations but a large number of allowable bills `k`.

2. **Repeated Binary Searches**: 
   - This check uses a count of how many times `Exists` is called. If called excessively (e.g., over 1000 calls), it triggers a warning. The checker is placed after the loops executing `Exists`.

3. **Ineffective Early Exit**:
   - This invariant was not explicitly coded since it often overlaps with the other checks and is conceptually covered by managing excessive calls or combinations. If needed, it could also be implemented by checking specific conditions where further processing is unnecessary, although this can be complex to quantify precisely without deeper logic refactoring. 

This code should help identify scenarios where inefficiencies occur, aiding in future optimizations and testing.
