system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

Let's introduce some definitions that will be needed later.

Let prime(x) be the set of prime divisors of x. For example, prime(140) = \{ 2, 5, 7 \}, prime(169) = \{ 13 \}.

Let g(x, p) be the maximum possible integer p^k where k is an integer such that x is divisible by p^k. For example:

  * g(45, 3) = 9 (45 is divisible by 3^2=9 but not divisible by 3^3=27), 
  * g(63, 7) = 7 (63 is divisible by 7^1=7 but not divisible by 7^2=49). 



Let f(x, y) be the product of g(y, p) for all p in prime(x). For example:

  * f(30, 70) = g(70, 2) ⋅ g(70, 3) ⋅ g(70, 5) = 2^1 ⋅ 3^0 ⋅ 5^1 = 10, 
  * f(525, 63) = g(63, 3) ⋅ g(63, 5) ⋅ g(63, 7) = 3^2 ⋅ 5^0 ⋅ 7^1 = 63. 



You have integers x and n. Calculate f(x, 1) ⋅ f(x, 2) ⋅ … ⋅ f(x, n) mod{(10^{9} + 7)}.

Input

The only line contains integers x and n (2 ≤ x ≤ 10^{9}, 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^{18}) — the numbers used in formula.

Output

Print the answer.

In the first example, f(10, 1) = g(1, 2) ⋅ g(1, 5) = 1, f(10, 2) = g(2, 2) ⋅ g(2, 5) = 2.

In the second example, actual value of formula is approximately 1.597 ⋅ 10^{171}. Make sure you print the answer modulo (10^{9} + 7).

assistant: Based on the provided information, let's analyze the code to identify expensive or inefficient segments and derive performance-characterizing invariants.

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Line-Level Hit Count Comparison:**
   - **`isprime` Function (Lines 8-14):** This function is called significantly more times for the slow input (`100` times) compared to the fast input (`2` times).
   - **Loop for Finding Divisors (Lines 25-30):** The loop runs `31623` times for the slow input, while only `12` times for the fast input.
   - **Power Calculation (`qpow` Function, Lines 15-20):** This function is hit `2607` times for the slow input, compared to `234` for the fast input.

2. **Analysis:**
   - The slow input results in a large number of iterations for the loops in the code, particularly in the divisor finding loop and the power calculation. This is likely due to the properties of the number `x` and its divisors.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **Invariant for Prime Checking and Divisor Loop:**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "When `x` has a large number of divisors or large prime factors, the prime-checking function and divisor-finding loop are called excessively, leading to significant slowdowns."
   
   - **Explanation:** The number of divisors affects the number of iterations in the loop and consequently the number of calls to the `isprime` function. Large numbers with many divisors or large prime factors cause this part of the code to become a bottleneck.

2. **Invariant for Power Calculation:**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "When there is a deep chain of powers to compute for the divisors of `x`, the repeated use of the power calculation function leads to a performance bottleneck."
   
   - **Explanation:** The nested loop in lines 31-39 iterates over the divisors of `x`, and the while-loop inside it repeatedly computes powers of these divisors. If `x` or its divisors are large, this computation becomes costly, especially for high values of `n`.

### Conclusion

Given the constraints (e.g., `x <= 10^9`), these performance-characterizing invariants suggest that the key to understanding slow scenarios lies in the divisor properties of `x` and the complexities introduced by large prime factors or a rich divisor structure. This understanding can guide optimizations or checks to anticipate and handle such performance issues.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
Let's introduce some definitions that will be needed later.

Let prime(x) be the set of prime divisors of x. For example, prime(140) = \{ 2, 5, 7 \}, prime(169) = \{ 13 \}.

Let g(x, p) be the maximum possible integer p^k where k is an integer such that x is divisible by p^k. For example:

  * g(45, 3) = 9 (45 is divisible by 3^2=9 but not divisible by 3^3=27), 
  * g(63, 7) = 7 (63 is divisible by 7^1=7 but not divisible by 7^2=49). 



Let f(x, y) be the product of g(y, p) for all p in prime(x). For example:

  * f(30, 70) = g(70, 2) ⋅ g(70, 3) ⋅ g(70, 5) = 2^1 ⋅ 3^0 ⋅ 5^1 = 10, 
  * f(525, 63) = g(63, 3) ⋅ g(63, 5) ⋅ g(63, 7) = 3^2 ⋅ 5^0 ⋅ 7^1 = 63. 



You have integers x and n. Calculate f(x, 1) ⋅ f(x, 2) ⋅ … ⋅ f(x, n) mod{(10^{9} + 7)}.

Input

The only line contains integers x and n (2 ≤ x ≤ 10^{9}, 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^{18}) — the numbers used in formula.

In the second example, actual value of formula is approximately 1.597 ⋅ 10^{171}. Make sure you print the answer modulo (10^{9} + 7).

In the third example, be careful about overflow issue.

Solution (C++ code):
{solution}


assistant: Let's implement the performance-characterizing invariants as checker functions in C++ and integrate them into the original program.

### Phase 3: Implement the Natural Language Invariants as C++ Checkers

1. **Invariant for Prime Checking and Divisor Loop:**

   This invariant identifies when `x` has a large number of divisors or large prime factors, leading to excessive calls to the `isprime` function and divisor-finding loop.

   ```cpp
   void check_divisor_invariant(unsigned long long divisorCount, unsigned long long primeFactorCount) {
       if (divisorCount > 50000 || primeFactorCount > 10) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to excessive divisors or large prime factors!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Invariant for Power Calculation:**

   This invariant detects when there is a deep chain of powers to compute for the divisors of `x`.

   ```cpp
   void check_power_calculation_invariant(unsigned long long powerIterations) {
       if (powerIterations > 1000000) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to excessive power calculations!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Integrate the Checkers into the Original Program

Now, let's insert these checks into the provided C++ code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
const int N = 1e5 + 100;

### Summary
- The `check_divisor_invariant` function will trigger if `x` has too many divisors or large prime factors, causing excessive operations in the divisor-finding loop.
- The `check_power_calculation_invariant` function will trigger if the power calculations are repeated excessively, indicating a potential performance bottleneck.
- These checks are placed after calculating the necessary values but before entering any deep loops to avoid additional overhead.
