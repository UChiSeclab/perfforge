system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

Anadi has a set of dominoes. Every domino has two parts, and each part contains some dots. For every a and b such that 1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 6, there is exactly one domino with a dots on one half and b dots on the other half. The set contains exactly 21 dominoes. Here is an exact illustration of his set:

<image>

Also, Anadi has an undirected graph without self-loops and multiple edges. He wants to choose some dominoes and place them on the edges of this graph. He can use at most one domino of each type. Each edge can fit at most one domino. It's not necessary to place a domino on each edge of the graph.

When placing a domino on an edge, he also chooses its direction. In other words, one half of any placed domino must be directed toward one of the endpoints of the edge and the other half must be directed toward the other endpoint. There's a catch: if there are multiple halves of dominoes directed toward the same vertex, each of these halves must contain the same number of dots.

How many dominoes at most can Anadi place on the edges of his graph?

Input

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 7, 0 ≤ m ≤ (n⋅(n-1))/(2)) — the number of vertices and the number of edges in the graph.

The next m lines contain two integers each. Integers in the i-th line are a_i and b_i (1 ≤ a, b ≤ n, a ≠ b) and denote that there is an edge which connects vertices a_i and b_i.

The graph might be disconnected. It's however guaranteed that the graph doesn't contain any self-loops, and that there is at most one edge between any pair of vertices.

Output

Output one integer which denotes the maximum number of dominoes which Anadi can place on the edges of the graph.

Note that each vertex is faced by the halves of dominoes with the same number of dots. For instance, all halves directed toward vertex 1 have three dots.

assistant: ### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

Based on the hit count information provided:

1. **Line 15** (`for (long long int j = 0; j < v.size(); j++)`): This line is executed significantly more times for the slow input (3,359,232 hits) compared to the fast input (839,808 hits). This suggests that the loop over the edges of the graph is a major contributor to the slowdown.

2. **Line 17** (`if (m.find({val[f], val[t]}) == m.end())`): This line, part of the inner loop, is also hit many times (3,079,296 hits for slow input vs. 559,872 for fast input). This indicates frequent checks for already placed dominoes, which implies repeated lookups in the map `m`.

3. **Line 18** (`m[{val[f], val[t]}] = 1, m[{val[t], val[f]}] = 1, cnt++`): This line is part of the conditional block that inserts new elements into the map and increments `cnt`. The number of hits (1,923,516 for slow and 545,616 for fast) shows that this operation is performed frequently.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the analysis above, here are some natural language performance invariants that describe when the program is likely to slow down:

1. **Invariant #1: Increased Edge Count**
   - Natural Language Description: "If the number of edges in the graph is large compared to the number of vertices, the program will experience significant slowdown due to repeated iterations over edges."
   - This invariant captures the increased overhead associated with larger edge sets, which require more iterations and map lookups.

2. **Invariant #2: Large Search Space in DFS**
   - Natural Language Description: "If the depth of the DFS search is high due to a large number of vertices (close to 7), the computational effort increases exponentially, leading to a slowdown."
   - This invariant highlights the exponential nature of the DFS search space when the number of vertices approaches its upper limit.

3. **Invariant #3: Frequent Map Operations**
   - Natural Language Description: "If the graph structure leads to frequent insertions and lookups in the hashmap (e.g., when many potential domino placements need to be checked), performance can degrade."
   - This addresses the overhead of map operations, which become a bottleneck when the graph structure is complex.

4. **Invariant #4: High Graph Connectivity**
   - Natural Language Description: "In cases where the graph is highly connected, requiring verification of many potential domino configurations, the algorithm will slow."
   - High connectivity increases the number of potential domino placements that need to be checked, increasing computational load.

These invariants abstractly describe the conditions under which the program is likely to enter a slow path, considering the constraints (n ≤ 7). They avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input but instead focus on categorical descriptions like edge count or graph connectivity.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
Anadi has a set of dominoes. Every domino has two parts, and each part contains some dots. For every a and b such that 1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 6, there is exactly one domino with a dots on one half and b dots on the other half. The set contains exactly 21 dominoes. Here is an exact illustration of his set:

<image>

Also, Anadi has an undirected graph without self-loops and multiple edges. He wants to choose some dominoes and place them on the edges of this graph. He can use at most one domino of each type. Each edge can fit at most one domino. It's not necessary to place a domino on each edge of the graph.

When placing a domino on an edge, he also chooses its direction. In other words, one half of any placed domino must be directed toward one of the endpoints of the edge and the other half must be directed toward the other endpoint. There's a catch: if there are multiple halves of dominoes directed toward the same vertex, each of these halves must contain the same number of dots.

How many dominoes at most can Anadi place on the edges of his graph?

Input

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 7, 0 ≤ m ≤ (n⋅(n-1))/(2)) — the number of vertices and the number of edges in the graph.

The next m lines contain two integers each. Integers in the i-th line are a_i and b_i (1 ≤ a, b ≤ n, a ≠ b) and denote that there is an edge which connects vertices a_i and b_i.

The graph might be disconnected. It's however guaranteed that the graph doesn't contain any self-loops, and that there is at most one edge between any pair of vertices.

Output

Output one integer which denotes the maximum number of dominoes which Anadi can place on the edges of the graph.

assistant: ### Phase 3: Implement the Natural Language Invariants in C++

Let's implement checker functions based on the natural language invariants derived earlier.

1. **Invariant #1: Increased Edge Count**
   - This checker will verify if the number of edges is disproportionately high compared to the number of vertices.
   
```cpp
void check_edge_count_invariant(int vertices, int edges) {
    if (edges > vertices * (vertices - 1) / 4) {  // Heuristic threshold
        cerr << "Warning: edge_count_invariant triggered - high edge count!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

2. **Invariant #2: Large Search Space in DFS**
   - This checker will ensure the DFS depth (related to vertices) doesn't get too high.
   
```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(int vertices) {
    if (vertices >= 7) {  // Close to maximum possible, as per constraints
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high DFS depth!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

3. **Invariant #3: Frequent Map Operations**
   - This checker will track frequent operations on the map `m`.
   
```cpp
void check_map_operation_invariant(int operationCount) {
    if (operationCount > 1000000) {  // Arbitrary threshold for frequent operations
        cerr << "Warning: map_operation_invariant triggered - excessive map operations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

4. **Invariant #4: High Graph Connectivity**
   - This checker will evaluate if the graph is highly connected.
   
```cpp
void check_graph_connectivity_invariant(int vertices, int edges) {
    if (edges == vertices * (vertices - 1) / 2) {  // Fully connected
        cerr << "Warning: graph_connectivity_invariant triggered - high connectivity!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrate Checker Code into the Original Program

Now, let's integrate these checkers into the provided C++ program by placing them in strategic locations:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
const long long int inf = (long long int)1e18 + 10;
map<pair<long long int, long long int>, long long int> m;
vector<pair<long long int, long long int> > v;
long long int ans = 0;
long long int val[10];
void dfs(long long int x) {
    static int mapOperationCount = 0;

    for (long long int i = 1; i <= 6; i++) {
        val[x] = i;
        if (x != 1)
            dfs(x - 1);
        else {
            long long int cnt = 0;
            for (long long int j = 0; j < v.size(); j++) {
                long long int f = v[j].first, t = v[j].second;
                if (m.find({val[f], val[t]}) == m.end()) {
                    m[{val[f], val[t]}] = 1, m[{val[t], val[f]}] = 1, cnt++;
                    mapOperationCount++;
                }
            }
            ans = max(ans, cnt);
            m.clear();
        }
        check_map_operation_invariant(mapOperationCount);  // Check map operation frequency
    }
}

void check_edge_count_invariant(int vertices, int edges) {
    if (edges > vertices * (vertices - 1) / 4) {
        cerr << "Warning: edge_count_invariant triggered - high edge count!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_dfs_invariant(int vertices) {
    if (vertices >= 7) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high DFS depth!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_map_operation_invariant(int operationCount) {
    if (operationCount > 1000000) {
        cerr << "Warning: map_operation_invariant triggered - excessive map operations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_graph_connectivity_invariant(int vertices, int edges) {
    if (edges == vertices * (vertices - 1) / 2) {
        cerr << "Warning: graph_connectivity_invariant triggered - high connectivity!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

signed main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(0);
    cout.tie(0);
    long long int n, me, x, y;
    cin >> n >> me;
    
    check_dfs_invariant(n);  // Check DFS depth based on vertices
    check_edge_count_invariant(n, me);  // Check edge count against vertices
    check_graph_connectivity_invariant(n, me);  // Check graph connectivity
    
    for (long long int i = 1; i <= me; i++) {
        cin >> x >> y;
        v.push_back({x, y});
    }
    dfs(n);
    cout << ans << endl;
}
```

### Explanation:

- **Checker Functions**: These are implemented as helper functions that encapsulate the conditions derived from natural language invariants.
  
- **Checker Integration**: The checks are integrated at strategic points where they effectively monitor potential performance degradation without adding significant overhead to tight loops, except where necessary to count operations.

- **Abort on Trigger**: Each checker function calls `abort()` if a performance bottleneck is detected, providing clear feedback during testing or fuzzing.
