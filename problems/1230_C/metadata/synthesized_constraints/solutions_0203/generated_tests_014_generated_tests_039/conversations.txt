system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

Anadi has a set of dominoes. Every domino has two parts, and each part contains some dots. For every a and b such that 1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 6, there is exactly one domino with a dots on one half and b dots on the other half. The set contains exactly 21 dominoes. Here is an exact illustration of his set:

<image>

Also, Anadi has an undirected graph without self-loops and multiple edges. He wants to choose some dominoes and place them on the edges of this graph. He can use at most one domino of each type. Each edge can fit at most one domino. It's not necessary to place a domino on each edge of the graph.

When placing a domino on an edge, he also chooses its direction. In other words, one half of any placed domino must be directed toward one of the endpoints of the edge and the other half must be directed toward the other endpoint. There's a catch: if there are multiple halves of dominoes directed toward the same vertex, each of these halves must contain the same number of dots.

How many dominoes at most can Anadi place on the edges of his graph?

Input

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 7, 0 ≤ m ≤ (n⋅(n-1))/(2)) — the number of vertices and the number of edges in the graph.

The next m lines contain two integers each. Integers in the i-th line are a_i and b_i (1 ≤ a, b ≤ n, a ≠ b) and denote that there is an edge which connects vertices a_i and b_i.

The graph might be disconnected. It's however guaranteed that the graph doesn't contain any self-loops, and that there is at most one edge between any pair of vertices.

Output

Output one integer which denotes the maximum number of dominoes which Anadi can place on the edges of the graph.

And here is one of the ways to place a domino on each of its edges:

Note that each vertex is faced by the halves of dominoes with the same number of dots. For instance, all halves directed toward vertex 1 have three dots.

assistant: ### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Line-level Hit Count Comparison**:
   - The most notable difference in hit counts between the slow and fast inputs occurs in the inner loop of the `rec` function:
     - Line 12: `for (long long node : g[i])` has approximately 2.5 times more hits in the slow input compared to the fast input.
     - Lines 13-15 within this loop also reflect this increased hit count.

2. **Pinpoint Lines or Functions with Significant Hits**:
   - The function `rec` is called within a loop that generates permutations of node labels (lines 36-38). This function iterates over graph nodes to form pairs and counts unique pairs. The increased hits indicate more iterations over the graph structure for the slow input.

3. **Inference on Interaction with Data Structures**:
   - The graph structure `g` and the permutation logic in `rec` imply that the slowdown is related to the complexity of graph connectivity and the number of permutations examined. More edges in the graph lead to increased iterations within the nested loop (lines 11-15).
   - The `rec` function's performance is directly affected by the connectivity of the graph and the permutations generated, causing more extensive checks for valid domino placements.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **Natural Language Invariants**:
   - **Invariant #1**: "If the graph is densely connected, meaning a high number of edges relative to the number of vertices, the performance may degrade. This is because the program generates permutations of node labels and checks each against a potentially large set of connected nodes."
   - **Invariant #2**: "If the graph has a complex structure with many edges leading into each node, the algorithm may slow due to repeated evaluations of node permutations for domino placements."
   - **Invariant #3**: "When the number of permutations examined is high, particularly close to factorial of the number of nodes, the computation within the recursive function significantly increases, leading to performance bottlenecks."

2. **Correlate Conditions Strongly to Input Patterns**:
   - The slowdown occurs when the graph's edge count and connectivity pattern cause the permutation loop to evaluate a vast number of possibilities.
   - The complexity is compounded if nodes have many edges connecting to other nodes, creating many potential domino placements to evaluate in `rec`.

3. **Threshold Suggestions**:
   - The threshold for these scenarios is linked to the factorial growth of permutations, constrained by `n = 7` (e.g., 7! = 5040 permutations). Dense connectivity amplifies this factor.
   - For future inputs, scenarios where `m` (number of edges) approaches the upper limit for given `n` (e.g., complete graph configurations at max `m = 21` for `n = 7`) should be watched for potential performance issues.

### Conclusion

In essence, the program's performance degrades significantly with increased graph connectivity, especially when evaluating many permutations under dense edge conditions. This is a classic combinatorial explosion problem where the inherent complexity of the input graph structure directly influences execution time.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Code implementing the natural language description:

void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
Anadi has a set of dominoes. Every domino has two parts, and each part contains some dots. For every a and b such that 1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 6, there is exactly one domino with a dots on one half and b dots on the other half. The set contains exactly 21 dominoes. Here is an exact illustration of his set:

When placing a domino on an edge, he also chooses its direction. In other words, one half of any placed domino must be directed toward one of the endpoints of the edge and the other half must be directed toward the other endpoint. There's a catch: if there are multiple halves of dominoes directed toward the same vertex, each of these halves must contain the same number of dots.

How many dominoes at most can Anadi place on the edges of his graph?

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 7, 0 ≤ m ≤ (n⋅(n-1))/(2)) — the number of vertices and the number of edges in the graph.

The next m lines contain two integers each. Integers in the i-th line are a_i and b_i (1 ≤ a, b ≤ n, a ≠ b) and denote that there is an edge which connects vertices a_i and b_i.

The graph might be disconnected. It's however guaranteed that the graph doesn't contain any self-loops, and that there is at most one edge between any pair of vertices.

Output

Output one integer which denotes the maximum number of dominoes which Anadi can place on the edges of the graph.

Note

Here is an illustration of Anadi's graph from the first sample test:

And here is one of the ways to place a domino on each of its edges:

<image>

Note that each vertex is faced by the halves of dominoes with the same number of dots. For instance, all halves directed toward vertex 1 have three dots.

assistant: ### Phase 3: Implementing Invariants as Checker Code in C++

Let's translate the natural language invariants derived in Phase 2 into checker functions in C++. Each function will emit a warning and abort the execution if the condition is met, signaling a potential performance bottleneck.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <set>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

// Checker for graph density-related performance bottleneck
void check_graph_density_invariant(int n, int m) {
    // If m is large compared to n (close to a complete graph), this may slow down
    if (m > n * (n - 1) / 4) { // Example threshold: half of the max edges possible
        std::cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to graph density!" << std::endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Checker for permutation-related bottleneck
void check_permutation_invariant(int n) {
    // If the number of nodes n is high, permutations might be too extensive
    if (n > 5) { // Considering factorial growth, n > 5 leads to excessive permutations
        std::cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to excessive permutations!" << std::endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Checker for node connectivity-related performance bottleneck
void check_node_connectivity_invariant(const std::vector<std::vector<int>>& g, int n) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        if (g[i].size() > n / 2) { // Example threshold: high connectivity relative to the node count
            std::cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to high node connectivity!" << std::endl;
            abort();
        }
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrating Checker Code into the Original C++ Program

Now, we'll integrate the above checkers into the original C++ program. We'll place these checks at strategic points in the program to catch potential bottlenecks early during execution.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
const long long INF = 1e9 + 7;
const long long sz = 1e5 + 20;
const long long N = 7;
vector<pair<long long, long long>> edges;
long long c[N];
vector<long long> g[N];

// Checker for graph density-related performance bottleneck
void check_graph_density_invariant(int n, int m) {
    // If m is large compared to n (close to a complete graph), this may slow down
    if (m > n * (n - 1) / 4) { // Example threshold: half of the max edges possible
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to graph density!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Checker for permutation-related bottleneck
void check_permutation_invariant(int n) {
    // If the number of nodes n is high, permutations might be too extensive
    if (n > 5) { // Considering factorial growth, n > 5 leads to excessive permutations
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to excessive permutations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Checker for node connectivity-related performance bottleneck
void check_node_connectivity_invariant(const vector<long long> g[], int n) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        if (g[i].size() > n / 2) { // Example threshold: high connectivity relative to the node count
            cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to high node connectivity!" << endl;
            abort();
        }
    }
}

long long rec() {
    set<pair<long long, long long>> s;
    for (long long i = 1; i < N; i++) {
        for (long long node : g[i]) {
            long long cu = c[i - 1], cv = c[node - 1];
            if (cu > cv) swap(cu, cv);
            s.insert(make_pair(cu, cv));
        }
    }
    return s.size();
}

void solve() {
    long long n, m;
    cin >> n >> m;

    // Insert checker for graph density
    check_graph_density_invariant(n, m);

    long long u, v;
    for (long long i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        cin >> u >> v;
        if (u > v) swap(u, v);
        g[v].push_back(u), g[u].push_back(v);
    }

    // Insert checker for node connectivity
    check_node_connectivity_invariant(g, n);

    if (n <= 6)
        cout << m << endl;
    else {
        long long ans = 0;
        
        // Insert checker for permutation-related bottleneck
        check_permutation_invariant(n);

        for (long long extra = 0; extra < N - 1; extra++) {
            for (long long i = 0; i < N - 1; i++) c[i] = i;
            c[6] = extra;
            do {
                ans = max(rec(), ans);
            } while (next_permutation(c, c + N));
        }
        cout << ans << endl;
    }
    return;
}

int32_t main() {
    clock_t st = clock();
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);
    cout.tie(NULL);

    long long t = 1;
    while (t--) {
        solve();
    }
    clog << (long double)((clock() - st) / CLOCKS_PER_SEC) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

- **Graph Density Check**: This check ensures that the number of edges `m` compared to the number of vertices `n` does not approach the density of a complete graph, which would lead to excessive computation.
- **Permutation Check**: Ensures that the number of nodes `n` does not lead to an explosion in the number of permutations (e.g., factorial growth).
- **Node Connectivity Check**: Monitors the connectivity level of each node, ensuring it doesn't exceed a certain threshold relative to `n`, which could cause performance degradation due to extensive evaluations.

These checks are strategically placed after reading inputs and before starting computationally intensive tasks such as permutations and graph processing. This ensures that potential bottlenecks are caught early without introducing overhead inside tight loops.
