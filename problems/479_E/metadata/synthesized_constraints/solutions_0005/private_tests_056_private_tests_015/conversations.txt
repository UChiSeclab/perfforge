system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

Imagine that you are in a building that has exactly n floors. You can move between the floors in a lift. Let's number the floors from bottom to top with integers from 1 to n. Now you're on the floor number a. You are very bored, so you want to take the lift. Floor number b has a secret lab, the entry is forbidden. However, you already are in the mood and decide to make k consecutive trips in the lift.

Let us suppose that at the moment you are on the floor number x (initially, you were on floor a). For another trip between floors you choose some floor with number y (y ≠ x) and the lift travels to this floor. As you cannot visit floor b with the secret lab, you decided that the distance from the current floor x to the chosen y must be strictly less than the distance from the current floor x to floor b with the secret lab. Formally, it means that the following inequation must fulfill: |x - y| < |x - b|. After the lift successfully transports you to floor y, you write down number y in your notepad.

Your task is to find the number of distinct number sequences that you could have written in the notebook as the result of k trips in the lift. As the sought number of trips can be rather large, find the remainder after dividing the number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).

Input

The first line of the input contains four space-separated integers n, a, b, k (2 ≤ n ≤ 5000, 1 ≤ k ≤ 5000, 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n, a ≠ b).

Output

Print a single integer — the remainder after dividing the sought number of sequences by 1000000007 (109 + 7).

Note

Two sequences p1, p2, ..., pk and q1, q2, ..., qk are distinct, if there is such integer j (1 ≤ j ≤ k), that pj ≠ qj.

Notes to the samples:

  1. In the first sample after the first trip you are either on floor 1, or on floor 3, because |1 - 2| < |2 - 4| and |3 - 2| < |2 - 4|. 
  2. In the second sample there are two possible sequences: (1, 2); (1, 3). You cannot choose floor 3 for the first trip because in this case no floor can be the floor for the second trip. 
  3. In the third sample there are no sought sequences, because you cannot choose the floor for the first trip.

assistant: To analyze the provided program and identify performance bottlenecks, we will use the hit count information and compare the slow and fast inputs. The goal is to derive conditions under which the program enters a slow path.

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Comparison of Hit Counts**: 
   - The slow input exhibits extremely high hit counts in the loops and conditional statements, particularly between lines 42 to 54 and 43 to 51. 
   - Conversely, for the fast input, the high hit counts occur between lines 21 to 33 and 28 to 30.

2. **Pinpointing Lines with Significant Hits**:
   - For the **slow input**, lines 42 to 54 are hit 5,001 times, with nested loops (lines 43 and 49) exhibiting millions of hits (24,995,000 and 25,000,000 respectively). This suggests extensive iterations over loop bodies.
   - In contrast, the **fast input** shows significant activity in lines 21 to 33, but with far fewer hits than the slow path.

3. **Interaction with Loops and Data Structures**:
   - The loops in both branches (`if (a > b)` and `if (b > a)`) are sensitive to the values of `a` and `b`, and specifically to the number of trips `k`.
   - Both branches involve updating and using arrays (`dp` and `temp`) based on conditions that depend on `n`, `a`, `b`, and `k`. The slow input seems to trigger a more exhaustive traversal of these arrays.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **Potential Invariant 1**: When the initial floor `a` is significantly closer to the forbidden floor `b`, and the number of trips `k` is large, the program may slow down considerably due to repeated calculations and updates in nested loops.
   - **Natural Language**: "If `a` is close to `b` and `k` is large, the program may slow down due to repeated operations over large loop iterations."

2. **Potential Invariant 2**: Extensive iterations occur when the difference between `a` and `b` is small, especially when `k` approaches its maximum value. This leads to repeated evaluations over all permissible floors.
   - **Natural Language**: "When `a` and `b` are close, and `k` is at its maximum, the program may perform vast numbers of computations due to exhaustive checks across possible sequences."

3. **Potential Invariant 3**: The program experiences slowdowns when the data processing on arrays `dp` and `temp` becomes intensive due to the cumulative effect of `k` iterations over large floor ranges.
   - **Natural Language**: "If the floor range processed per trip is large and `k` is high, array operations may lead to performance bottlenecks."

### Considerations

- These invariants abstract the conditions leading to performance issues without relying on specific input values. They highlight how close proximity of `a` to `b`, combined with the maximum possible `k`, leads to computationally heavy operations.
- The design and placement of loops suggest that performance degradation is triggered by comprehensive checks and updates across arrays based on current floor calculations.

This analysis helps in understanding the specific patterns in input values—particularly `a`, `b`, and `k`—that trigger slow execution paths, allowing for targeted optimization efforts.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
Imagine that you are in a building that has exactly n floors. You can move between the floors in a lift. Let's number the floors from bottom to top with integers from 1 to n. Now you're on the floor number a. You are very bored, so you want to take the lift. Floor number b has a secret lab, the entry is forbidden. However, you already are in the mood and decide to make k consecutive trips in the lift.

Let us suppose that at the moment you are on the floor number x (initially, you were on floor a). For another trip between floors you choose some floor with number y (y ≠ x) and the lift travels to this floor. As you cannot visit floor b with the secret lab, you decided that the distance from the current floor x to the chosen y must be strictly less than the distance from the current floor x to floor b with the secret lab. Formally, it means that the following inequation must fulfill: |x - y| < |x - b|. After the lift successfully transports you to floor y, you write down number y in your notepad.

Your task is to find the number of distinct number sequences that you could have written in the notebook as the result of k trips in the lift. As the sought number of trips can be rather large, find the remainder after dividing the number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).

Input

The first line of the input contains four space-separated integers n, a, b, k (2 ≤ n ≤ 5000, 1 ≤ k ≤ 5000, 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n, a ≠ b).

Output

Print a single integer — the remainder after dividing the sought number of sequences by 1000000007 (109 + 7).

Examples

Input

5 2 4 1


Output

2


Input

5 2 4 2


Output

2


Input

5 3 4 1


Output

0

Note

Two sequences p1, p2, ..., pk and q1, q2, ..., qk are distinct, if there is such integer j (1 ≤ j ≤ k), that pj ≠ qj.

Notes to the samples:

  1. In the first sample after the first trip you are either on floor 1, or on floor 3, because |1 - 2| < |2 - 4| and |3 - 2| < |2 - 4|. 
  2. In the second sample there are two possible sequences: (1, 2); (1, 3). You cannot choose floor 3 for the first trip because in this case no floor can be the floor for the second trip. 
  3. In the third sample there are no sought sequences, because you cannot choose the floor for the first trip. 

Solution (C++ code):

assistant: ### Phase 3: Implementing Natural Language Invariants in C++

Based on the natural language invariants derived, here are the C++ checker functions to monitor performance bottlenecks:

1. **Invariant 1 Check**: If `a` is close to `b` and `k` is large
   ```cpp
   void check_proximity_and_trip_size(int a, int b, int k, int n, int threshold_k, int proximity_limit) {
       if (abs(a - b) <= proximity_limit && k > threshold_k) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to proximity of 'a' and 'b' with large 'k'!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Invariant 2 Check**: When difference between `a` and `b` is small, and `k` is at maximum
   ```cpp
   void check_small_difference_and_max_k(int a, int b, int k, int n, int max_k, int small_diff_threshold) {
       if (abs(a - b) <= small_diff_threshold && k == max_k) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to small difference between 'a' and 'b' with maximum 'k'!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Invariant 3 Check**: Array operations due to large floor range
   ```cpp
   void check_large_floor_range_and_trip_count(int n, int k, int threshold_n, int threshold_k) {
       if (n > threshold_n && k > threshold_k) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to large floor range with high number of trips!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Integrating Checker Functions into the Original Program

Below is the instrumented C++ code, with the invariant checkers integrated effectively:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
const int INF = 0x3f;
const int MAXN = 5e3 + 5;
const int MOD = 1e9 + 7;
const int MAX_ASCII_CODE = 26;
const int MAX_NUMBER_OF_NODES = 1e5 + 5;
int dp[MAXN];
int temp[MAXN];

void check_proximity_and_trip_size(int a, int b, int k, int n, int threshold_k, int proximity_limit) {
    if (abs(a - b) <= proximity_limit && k > threshold_k) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to proximity of 'a' and 'b' with large 'k'!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_small_difference_and_max_k(int a, int b, int k, int n, int max_k, int small_diff_threshold) {
    if (abs(a - b) <= small_diff_threshold && k == max_k) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to small difference between 'a' and 'b' with maximum 'k'!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_large_floor_range_and_trip_count(int n, int k, int threshold_n, int threshold_k) {
    if (n > threshold_n && k > threshold_k) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to large floor range with high number of trips!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    cin.tie(0);
    cout.tie(0);
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(NULL);
    cout << fixed << setprecision(10);
    int n, a, b, k;
    cin >> n >> a >> b >> k;

    // Insert checks right after reading input
    check_proximity_and_trip_size(a, b, k, n, 3000, 10);
    check_small_difference_and_max_k(a, b, k, n, 5000, 5);
    check_large_floor_range_and_trip_count(n, k, 4000, 2000);

    dp[a] = 1;
    int ans = 0;
    int sav;

    if (a > b) {
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            for (int j = b + 2; j <= n; j++) {
                if (j + j - b - 1 < n)
                    temp[j + j - b - 1] = (temp[j + j - b - 1] + dp[j]) % MOD;
                else
                    temp[n] = (temp[n] + dp[j]) % MOD;
            }
            for (int j = n; j > b; j--) {
                temp[j] = (temp[j] + temp[j + 1]) % MOD;
                dp[j] = (MOD + temp[j] - dp[j]) % MOD;
            }
            sav = temp[b + 1];
            memset(temp, 0, sizeof(temp));
        }
        for (int j = b + 2; j <= n; j++) {
            ans = (ans + dp[j]) % MOD;
        }
        ans = (ans + sav) % MOD;
        cout << ans << "\n";
    }
    if (b > a) {
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            for (int j = b - 2; j > 0; j--) {
                if (j - b + j + 1 > 0)
                    temp[j + j - b + 1] = (temp[j + j - b - 1] + dp[j]) % MOD;
                else
                    temp[1] = (temp[1] + dp[j]) % MOD;
            }
            for (int j = 1; j < b; j++) {
                temp[j] = (temp[j] + temp[j - 1]) % MOD;
                dp[j] = (temp[j] - dp[j] + MOD) % MOD;
            }
            sav = temp[b - 1];
            memset(temp, 0, sizeof(temp));
        }
        for (int j = 1; j < b - 1; j++) {
            ans = (ans + dp[j]) % MOD;
        }
        ans = (ans + sav) % MOD;
        cout << ans << "\n";
    }
}
```

### Explanation of Check Placements:
- **Proximity and Trip Size**: Checks immediately after input, monitoring close proximity of `a` to `b` with large `k` values.
- **Small Difference and Max `k`**: Checks also post-input, focusing on minimal floor differences when `k` is maximum.
- **Large Floor Range and Trip Count**: Targets scenarios with large `n` and `k` values, ensuring they don't hit computationally intensive paths.

These checks are designed to pre-emptively warn of potential slow paths before heavy computations, providing early detection of problematic inputs.
