=== Invariants Response ===
To analyze the provided program and identify performance bottlenecks, we will use the hit count information and compare the slow and fast inputs. The goal is to derive conditions under which the program enters a slow path.

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Comparison of Hit Counts**: 
   - The slow input exhibits extremely high hit counts in the loops and conditional statements, particularly between lines 42 to 54 and 43 to 51. 
   - Conversely, for the fast input, the high hit counts occur between lines 21 to 33 and 28 to 30.

2. **Pinpointing Lines with Significant Hits**:
   - For the **slow input**, lines 42 to 54 are hit 5,001 times, with nested loops (lines 43 and 49) exhibiting millions of hits (24,995,000 and 25,000,000 respectively). This suggests extensive iterations over loop bodies.
   - In contrast, the **fast input** shows significant activity in lines 21 to 33, but with far fewer hits than the slow path.

3. **Interaction with Loops and Data Structures**:
   - The loops in both branches (`if (a > b)` and `if (b > a)`) are sensitive to the values of `a` and `b`, and specifically to the number of trips `k`.
   - Both branches involve updating and using arrays (`dp` and `temp`) based on conditions that depend on `n`, `a`, `b`, and `k`. The slow input seems to trigger a more exhaustive traversal of these arrays.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **Potential Invariant 1**: When the initial floor `a` is significantly closer to the forbidden floor `b`, and the number of trips `k` is large, the program may slow down considerably due to repeated calculations and updates in nested loops.
   - **Natural Language**: "If `a` is close to `b` and `k` is large, the program may slow down due to repeated operations over large loop iterations."

2. **Potential Invariant 2**: Extensive iterations occur when the difference between `a` and `b` is small, especially when `k` approaches its maximum value. This leads to repeated evaluations over all permissible floors.
   - **Natural Language**: "When `a` and `b` are close, and `k` is at its maximum, the program may perform vast numbers of computations due to exhaustive checks across possible sequences."

3. **Potential Invariant 3**: The program experiences slowdowns when the data processing on arrays `dp` and `temp` becomes intensive due to the cumulative effect of `k` iterations over large floor ranges.
   - **Natural Language**: "If the floor range processed per trip is large and `k` is high, array operations may lead to performance bottlenecks."

### Considerations

- These invariants abstract the conditions leading to performance issues without relying on specific input values. They highlight how close proximity of `a` to `b`, combined with the maximum possible `k`, leads to computationally heavy operations.
- The design and placement of loops suggest that performance degradation is triggered by comprehensive checks and updates across arrays based on current floor calculations.

This analysis helps in understanding the specific patterns in input values—particularly `a`, `b`, and `k`—that trigger slow execution paths, allowing for targeted optimization efforts.

### Phase 3: Implementing Natural Language Invariants in C++

Based on the natural language invariants derived, here are the C++ checker functions to monitor performance bottlenecks:

1. **Invariant 1 Check**: If `a` is close to `b` and `k` is large
   ```cpp
   void check_proximity_and_trip_size(int a, int b, int k, int n, int threshold_k, int proximity_limit) {
       if (abs(a - b) <= proximity_limit && k > threshold_k) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to proximity of 'a' and 'b' with large 'k'!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Invariant 2 Check**: When difference between `a` and `b` is small, and `k` is at maximum
   ```cpp
   void check_small_difference_and_max_k(int a, int b, int k, int n, int max_k, int small_diff_threshold) {
       if (abs(a - b) <= small_diff_threshold && k == max_k) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to small difference between 'a' and 'b' with maximum 'k'!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Invariant 3 Check**: Array operations due to large floor range
   ```cpp
   void check_large_floor_range_and_trip_count(int n, int k, int threshold_n, int threshold_k) {
       if (n > threshold_n && k > threshold_k) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to large floor range with high number of trips!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Integrating Checker Functions into the Original Program

Below is the instrumented C++ code, with the invariant checkers integrated effectively:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
const int INF = 0x3f;
const int MAXN = 5e3 + 5;
const int MOD = 1e9 + 7;
const int MAX_ASCII_CODE = 26;
const int MAX_NUMBER_OF_NODES = 1e5 + 5;
int dp[MAXN];
int temp[MAXN];

void check_proximity_and_trip_size(int a, int b, int k, int n, int threshold_k, int proximity_limit) {
    if (abs(a - b) <= proximity_limit && k > threshold_k) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to proximity of 'a' and 'b' with large 'k'!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_small_difference_and_max_k(int a, int b, int k, int n, int max_k, int small_diff_threshold) {
    if (abs(a - b) <= small_diff_threshold && k == max_k) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to small difference between 'a' and 'b' with maximum 'k'!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_large_floor_range_and_trip_count(int n, int k, int threshold_n, int threshold_k) {
    if (n > threshold_n && k > threshold_k) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to large floor range with high number of trips!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    cin.tie(0);
    cout.tie(0);
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(NULL);
    cout << fixed << setprecision(10);
    int n, a, b, k;
    cin >> n >> a >> b >> k;

    // Insert checks right after reading input
    check_proximity_and_trip_size(a, b, k, n, 3000, 10);
    check_small_difference_and_max_k(a, b, k, n, 5000, 5);
    check_large_floor_range_and_trip_count(n, k, 4000, 2000);

    dp[a] = 1;
    int ans = 0;
    int sav;

    if (a > b) {
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            for (int j = b + 2; j <= n; j++) {
                if (j + j - b - 1 < n)
                    temp[j + j - b - 1] = (temp[j + j - b - 1] + dp[j]) % MOD;
                else
                    temp[n] = (temp[n] + dp[j]) % MOD;
            }
            for (int j = n; j > b; j--) {
                temp[j] = (temp[j] + temp[j + 1]) % MOD;
                dp[j] = (MOD + temp[j] - dp[j]) % MOD;
            }
            sav = temp[b + 1];
            memset(temp, 0, sizeof(temp));
        }
        for (int j = b + 2; j <= n; j++) {
            ans = (ans + dp[j]) % MOD;
        }
        ans = (ans + sav) % MOD;
        cout << ans << "\n";
    }
    if (b > a) {
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            for (int j = b - 2; j > 0; j--) {
                if (j - b + j + 1 > 0)
                    temp[j + j - b + 1] = (temp[j + j - b - 1] + dp[j]) % MOD;
                else
                    temp[1] = (temp[1] + dp[j]) % MOD;
            }
            for (int j = 1; j < b; j++) {
                temp[j] = (temp[j] + temp[j - 1]) % MOD;
                dp[j] = (temp[j] - dp[j] + MOD) % MOD;
            }
            sav = temp[b - 1];
            memset(temp, 0, sizeof(temp));
        }
        for (int j = 1; j < b - 1; j++) {
            ans = (ans + dp[j]) % MOD;
        }
        ans = (ans + sav) % MOD;
        cout << ans << "\n";
    }
}
```

### Explanation of Check Placements:
- **Proximity and Trip Size**: Checks immediately after input, monitoring close proximity of `a` to `b` with large `k` values.
- **Small Difference and Max `k`**: Checks also post-input, focusing on minimal floor differences when `k` is maximum.
- **Large Floor Range and Trip Count**: Targets scenarios with large `n` and `k` values, ensuring they don't hit computationally intensive paths.

These checks are designed to pre-emptively warn of potential slow paths before heavy computations, providing early detection of problematic inputs.
