=== Invariants Response ===
To identify the performance bottlenecks and derive performance-characterizing invariants for the given C program, let's follow through the given tasks:

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

#### Step 1: Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.

The significant differences in line-level hit counts between the slow and fast runs are observed in the following lines:

- **Line 18:** `for (int i = f1; i <= f2; i++)`
  - Slow run hit count: **25,005,000**
  - Fast run hit count: **10,002**

- **Line 22 to Line 29:** These lines are heavily hit in the slow run, especially for line 26 where a while loop checks and adjusts `dp[i][bit1]` until it is non-negative.

#### Step 2: Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.

The line 18 containing the loop `for (int i = f1; i <= f2; i++)` is the main culprit because it iterates across a significantly larger range of values for `i` in the slow input compared to the fast input. This results in much higher hit counts for everything within this loop, particularly the while loop on line 26.

#### Step 3: Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc.

- **Line 18's Loop Range:** The values of `f1` and `f2` determine the range of this loop. The slow input configuration leads to a broader range because `f1 = 1` and `f2 = 4999`, compared to the fast input where `f1 = 5000` and `f2 = 5000`, leading to much fewer iterations.
  
- **While Loop on Line 26:** This loop may iterate multiple times if `dp[i][bit1]` is negative, causing a significant increase in operations.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants (Natural Language)

Based on the observations, let's derive invariants:

1. **Invariant on Loop Range:**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "If the range between `f1` and `f2` becomes large, especially when near the limits of `n`, the number of iterations in the loop increases significantly, leading to more computations."
   - **Threshold Consideration:** The loop range is crucial in determining performance, particularly when the range `f2 - f1` is close to `n`.

2. **Invariant on While Loop:**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "If many iterations of the while loop are needed to adjust `dp[i][bit1]` to a non-negative value, performance can degrade. This is impacted by the operations within the loop causing multiple increments by `mod`."
   - **Threshold Consideration:** This invariant triggers when negative values frequently occur in `dp[i][bit1]`, requiring the while loop to execute multiple times per iteration of the outer loop.

3. **Invariant on Iteration Combinations:**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "When both `a` is near the edge of its valid range (close to `1` or `n`), and the loop range (`f2 - f1`) is maximized, thereby causing the maximum number of potential floor transitions, the computation time may spike."
   - **Threshold Consideration:** This invariant could be monitored when `a` is at either extreme of its range (1 or n), requiring careful management of loop limits.

These invariants help identify scenarios that could cause a slowdown, even in similar-sized inputs, by focusing on the conditions that lead to significantly increased loop iterations and operations within the loops.

=== Checker Response ===
Let's implement the checker code for the performance-characterizing invariants identified in Phase 2.

### Phase 3: Implementing Checker Code in C++

Here are the C++ implementations of the natural language invariants we derived:

1. **Invariant on Loop Range:**
   ```cpp
   void check_loop_range_invariant(int f1, int f2, int n) {
       if ((f2 - f1) > 0.9 * n) {  // Arbitrary threshold close to n
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to large loop range!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Invariant on While Loop:**
   ```cpp
   void check_while_loop_invariant(long long dp_value, int mod) {
       if (dp_value < -mod) {  // When the value is extremely negative
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to excessive while loop iterations!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Invariant on Iteration Combinations:**
   ```cpp
   void check_iteration_combination_invariant(int a, int n) {
       if (a <= 1 || a >= n) {  // Edge values for a
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to edge-case starting floor!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Integrating Checkers into the Original Program

Now, let's integrate these checks into the provided program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
const int N = 5005;
const int mod = 1e9 + 7;
long long dp[N][2], sums[N][2];

// Checker functions
void check_loop_range_invariant(int f1, int f2, int n) {
    if ((f2 - f1) > 0.9 * n) {  // Arbitrary threshold close to n
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to large loop range!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_while_loop_invariant(long long dp_value, int mod) {
    if (dp_value < -mod) {  // When the value is extremely negative
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to excessive while loop iterations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_iteration_combination_invariant(int a, int n) {
    if (a <= 1 || a >= n) {  // Edge values for a
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to edge-case starting floor!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    int n, a, b, k, d, s1, s2;
    cin >> n >> a >> b >> k;

    // Perform initial checks
    check_iteration_combination_invariant(a, n);

    int f1, f2;
    if (a < b)
        f1 = 1, f2 = b - 1;
    else
        f1 = b + 1, f2 = n;

    // Check loop range before starting iterations
    check_loop_range_invariant(f1, f2, n);

    int bit1, bit2;
    for (int j = 0; j <= k; j++) {
        bit1 = j & 1;
        bit2 = bit1 ^ 1;
        for (int i = f1; i <= f2; i++) {
            if (j == 0) {
                dp[i][bit1] = 1;
            } else {
                d = abs(b - i);
                s1 = max(f1, i - d + 1);
                s2 = min(f2, i + d - 1);
                dp[i][bit1] = sums[s2][bit2] - sums[s1 - 1][bit2] - dp[i][bit2];

                // Check the while loop condition
                check_while_loop_invariant(dp[i][bit1], mod);

                while (dp[i][bit1] < 0) {
                    dp[i][bit1] += mod;
                }

                dp[i][bit1] %= mod;
            }
            if (i == f1)
                sums[i][bit1] = dp[i][bit1];
            else
                sums[i][bit1] = dp[i][bit1] + sums[i - 1][bit1], sums[i][bit1] %= mod;
        }
    }
    cout << dp[a][k & 1] << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

- **Loop Range Check:** Added before the loop starts to catch cases where the `f1` and `f2` range is large.
- **While Loop Check:** Placed just before the while loop to ensure we catch excessive iterations.
- **Iteration Combination Check:** Placed after reading inputs to catch edge cases where `a` is at the extremes. 

These checks help identify conditions that lead to potential performance bottlenecks during execution.
