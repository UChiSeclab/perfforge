=== Invariants Response ===
To diagnose the performance bottleneck of the given C program, let's analyze the line-level hit counts and derive performance-characterizing invariants.

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Line-Level Hit Counts Analysis**:
   - Under the slow input, the following lines were executed a large number of times:
     - Lines 11, 12, 14: These loops iterate significantly (up to 25,000,000 times) when `a < b`.
     - Lines 15-19: These operations, modifying `f`, `sum`, and `g` arrays, are heavily hit within the nested loops.
   - Under the fast input, the loop starting at line 29 and continuing to line 34 was executed 10,000 times, which is significantly fewer than the slow input's loops.

2. **Observations**:
   - The slow input triggers the loop that processes when `a < b`, whereas the fast input triggers the loop for `a >= b`. This indicates that the algorithm's complexity may vary significantly depending on the relationship between `a` and `b`.
   - The nested loops in the slow input suggest a computational complexity that grows with `b-a` and `m` (number of trips).

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the analysis, we can derive the following performance-characterizing invariants in natural language:

1. **Invariant 1: Large Difference with Forbidden Floor**:
   - **Description**: "If the initial floor `a` is significantly less than the forbidden floor `b`, the program may enter a computationally expensive loop. The complexity increases with the number of floors (`b-a`) processed in each trip sequence."
   - **Reasoning**: The slow input demonstrates that when `a < b`, the loops executing operations based on `b-a` are heavily iterated, indicating a higher time complexity due to increased search space.
   
2. **Invariant 2: High Number of Trips**:
   - **Description**: "If the number of trips `k` is large, especially when combined with a large difference between `a` and `b`, the program may become slow due to repeated calculations over a broad set of possible sequences."
   - **Reasoning**: As the number of trips increases, the number of possible sequences grows exponentially, leading to repeated execution of critical sections in the code.

3. **Invariant 3: Proximity to Forbidden Floor**:
   - **Description**: "When the initial floor and the target floor for each trip are close to the forbidden floor, the constraints lead to a limited set of valid moves, potentially causing inefficiencies in sequence generation."
   - **Reasoning**: Close proximity to the forbidden floor restricts valid floor choices, which can lead to redundant calculations or constrained path selections.

### Conclusion

The program's performance is impacted significantly when `a < b` with a high `b-a` and large `k`, leading to nested loops processing a broad search space. Efficient handling of these scenarios is critical to mitigating slow performance. Additionally, ensuring the algorithm effectively narrows down valid path choices without redundant calculations can improve efficiency.

=== Checker Response ===
Phase 3: Implementing the Invariants as C++ Checkers

Let's translate the performance-characterizing invariants we derived into C++ checkers.

### Invariant 1: Large Difference with Forbidden Floor

```cpp
void check_large_difference_invariant(int a, int b, int threshold) {
    if (b - a > threshold) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to large difference between a and b!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Invariant 2: High Number of Trips

```cpp
void check_high_trips_invariant(int k, int threshold) {
    if (k > threshold) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to high number of trips!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Invariant 3: Proximity to Forbidden Floor

```cpp
void check_proximity_invariant(int a, int b, int n, int proximity_threshold) {
    if (abs(a - b) < proximity_threshold || abs(b - (n-a)) < proximity_threshold) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to proximity to forbidden floor!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrating the Checkers into the Original Program

Now, let's integrate these checkers into the original C++ program at appropriate locations. I will add these checks after reading the inputs but before the main computation starts to avoid adding overhead in tight loops.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
const int N = 5e3 + 5, MOD = 1e9 + 7;
int n, a, b, m, ans;
int f[N], sum[N], g[N];

// Checkers for performance invariants
void check_large_difference_invariant(int a, int b, int threshold) {
    if (b - a > threshold) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to large difference between a and b!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_high_trips_invariant(int k, int threshold) {
    if (k > threshold) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to high number of trips!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_proximity_invariant(int a, int b, int n, int proximity_threshold) {
    if (abs(a - b) < proximity_threshold || abs(b - (n-a)) < proximity_threshold) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to proximity to forbidden floor!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    scanf("%d%d%d%d", &n, &a, &b, &m);
    
    // Performance checks
    check_large_difference_invariant(a, b, 2500); // Threshold for large difference
    check_high_trips_invariant(m, 3000);          // Threshold for high number of trips
    check_proximity_invariant(a, b, n, 2);        // Threshold for proximity to forbidden floor

    f[a] = 1;
    if (a < b) {
        sum[0] = 0;
        for (register int i = 1; i < b; ++i) sum[i] = (sum[i - 1] + f[i]) % MOD;
        for (register int i = 1; i < b; ++i) g[i] = f[i];
        for (register int i = 1; i <= m; ++i) {
            for (register int j = 1; j < b; ++j)
                f[j] = ((sum[j + (b - j + 1) / 2 - 1] - sum[0] - g[j]) % MOD + MOD) % MOD;
            sum[0] = 0;
            for (register int j = 1; j < b; ++j) sum[j] = (sum[j - 1] + f[j]) % MOD;
            for (register int j = 1; j < b; ++j) g[j] = f[j];
        }
        for (register int i = 1; i < b; ++i) ans = (ans + f[i]) % MOD;
        printf("%d\n", ans);
    } else {
        sum[b] = 0;
        for (register int i = b + 1; i <= n; ++i)
            sum[i] = (sum[i - 1] + f[i]) % MOD;
        for (register int i = b + 1; i <= n; ++i) g[i] = f[i];
        for (register int i = 1; i <= m; ++i) {
            for (register int j = b + 1; j <= n; ++j)
                f[j] = ((sum[n] - sum[j - (j - b + 1) / 2] - g[j]) % MOD + MOD) % MOD;
            sum[b] = 0;
            for (register int j = b + 1; j <= n; ++j)
                sum[j] = (sum[j - 1] + f[j]) % MOD;
            for (register int j = b + 1; j <= n; ++j) g[j] = f[j];
        }
        for (register int i = b + 1; i <= n; ++i) ans = (ans + f[i]) % MOD;
        printf("%d\n", ans);
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

- **Check Placement**: The checks are placed after input parsing to prevent overhead in tight loops, ensuring they don't degrade performance.
- **Thresholds**: The thresholds (e.g., `2500` for large differences, `3000` for trips) are selected based on reasonable assumptions given the constraints.
- **Abort on Trigger**: Each check issues a warning and aborts if its condition is met, making it clear when a performance bottleneck condition is encountered.
