=== Invariants Response ===
To address the performance bottleneck in the provided C program, we can break down the analysis into two phases and then derive performance-characterizing invariants.

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Hit Count Analysis**:
   - The line-level hit counts indicate that the loop starting at line 29 is executed 5001 times in the fast input scenario but is not hit at all in the slow input scenario. This suggests that the slow performance may not be due to line-by-line execution but rather a different path through the code.
   - The loop starting at line 31 seems to get considerable iterations (`5000` times for the fast input), which indicates that its absence in the slow path might be a clue.

2. **Code Segment Interaction**:
   - The loops on lines 29-38 and 31-37 are designed to compute potential paths for the elevator trips. The absence of hits in these loops for the slow input suggests that the condition `a < b` is not met, and thus the corresponding code block is not executed.
   - This lack of execution implies that the computation path for `a >= b` is insufficiently explored or optimized for the input given, leading to no feasible sequences being computed.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the analysis, the following natural language invariants can describe when the program might enter a slow execution path:

1. **Invariant #1: Unreachable Paths**:
   - **Description**: "If the starting floor `a` is greater than or equal to the forbidden floor `b`, and there are no valid floors to move to for the initial trip, the code may not execute the path calculation logic leading to a result of zero sequences."
   - **Reasoning**: This situation results in the program not entering its main computation loops, effectively skipping any potential path generation.

2. **Invariant #2: Limits on Path Choices**:
   - **Description**: "When the restriction on moving to a floor `y` (|x - y| < |x - b|) is too stringent, particularly for `a >= b`, it may severely limit the available choices, causing no valid sequences to be calculated."
   - **Reasoning**: This invariant captures how the choice constraint can prevent any initial valid path from being set up, leading to a lack of further computation.

3. **Invariant #3: Over-constrained Movement**:
   - **Description**: "If the proximity constraints to the forbidden floor result in no valid starting positions or subsequent movements, especially when `a` is near `b`, the computation might terminate prematurely with no valid sequences."
   - **Reasoning**: Reflects how initial conditions can prevent any valid setup, stopping the algorithm before meaningful calculations are performed.

These invariants help detect conditions where the program fails to compute any sequences or takes an inefficient path through its logic, linked to specific input constraints or floor positions.

=== Checker Response ===
### Phase 3: Implementing Performance-Characterizing Invariants in C++

First, let's translate the natural language invariants into C++ code that checks the conditions at runtime:

1. **Invariant #1: Unreachable Paths**
   ```cpp
   void check_unreachable_paths(bool condition) {
       if (condition) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - No valid starting floors for initial trip." << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Invariant #2: Limits on Path Choices**
   ```cpp
   void check_limits_on_path_choices(bool condition) {
       if (condition) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - Constraints are too stringent, limiting path choices." << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Invariant #3: Over-constrained Movement**
   ```cpp
   void check_over_constrained_movement(bool condition) {
       if (condition) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - Over-constrained movement results in no valid sequences." << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Integrating the Checkers into the Original Program

Now, let's integrate these checks into the original C++ code. We need to strategically place these checks to ensure they don't add overhead inside tight loops and are effective in catching the performance bottlenecks.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
const int INF = 5000 + 10, mod = 1000000007;
long long n, a, b, k;
long long c[INF][INF];

void check_unreachable_paths(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - No valid starting floors for initial trip." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_limits_on_path_choices(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - Constraints are too stringent, limiting path choices." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_over_constrained_movement(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - Over-constrained movement results in no valid sequences." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    cin >> n >> a >> b >> k;
    
    // Check for unreachable paths - invariant #1
    check_unreachable_paths((a >= b) && (b + 1 > n));
    
    // Check for limits on path choices - invariant #2
    check_limits_on_path_choices((a < b) && (b - 1 < 1));
    
    // Check for over-constrained movement - invariant #3
    check_over_constrained_movement((abs(a - b) <= 1));

    if (a < b) {
        for (int i = 1; i < b; i++) {
            c[0][i] = 1;
        }
    } else {
        for (int i = b + 1; i <= n; i++) {
            c[0][i] = 1;
        }
    }
    if (a < b) {
        for (int i = 1; i <= k; i++) {
            c[i][b - 1] = 0;
            for (int j = b - 2; j >= 1; j--) {
                int j1 = 2 * j - b + 1, j2 = 2 * j - b + 2;
                c[i][j] = (c[i][j + 1] - c[i - 1][j] + c[i - 1][j + 1] +
                           c[i - 1][j1] * (j1 > 0 ? 1 : 0) +
                           c[i - 1][j2] * (j2 > 0 ? 1 : 0)) %
                          mod;
            }
        }
    } else {
        for (int i = 1; i <= k; i++) {
            c[i][b + 1] = 0;
            for (int j = b + 2; j <= n; j++) {
                int j1 = 2 * j - b - 1, j2 = 2 * j - b - 2;
                c[i][j] = (c[i][j - 1] - c[i - 1][j] + c[i - 1][j - 1] +
                           c[i - 1][j1] * (j1 <= n ? 1 : 0) +
                           c[i - 1][j2] * (j2 <= n ? 1 : 0)) %
                          mod;
            }
        }
    }
    long long ans = c[k][a];
    while (ans < 0) ans += mod;
    cout << ans << endl;
}
```

### Explanation
- **Invariant #1**: Checks if no valid starting floors are available when `a >= b` and `b + 1 > n`.
- **Invariant #2**: Checks if constraints are too stringent when `a < b` and `b - 1 < 1`.
- **Invariant #3**: Checks if movement constraints are over-constrained when `abs(a - b) <= 1`.

These checks ensure that the program can detect scenarios where performance bottlenecks may occur due to input constraints or logic paths in the program.
