=== Invariants Response ===
### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

**Comparison of Line-Level Hit Counts:**

- **Line 13 (`for (int i = 1; i < b; i++)`):** Slow input hit count is significantly higher (5000 vs 2 for fast input).
- **Line 18 (`for (int j = 1; j < b; j++)`):** Slow input hit count is extremely high (25,000,000 vs 10,000 for fast input).
- **Lines 19 to 23:** These lines involve computations and assignments, with slow input hit counts around 24,995,000 versus 5,000 for fast input.
- **Lines 25 to 27:** Similar high hit counts for slow input as lines 18 to 23.

**Inference:**

- The nested loops (lines 18-27) are executed far more frequently for the slow input. This indicates that the conditions leading into these loops result in significantly more iterations.
- The index `b` is a critical factor for both the outer and inner loop conditions, causing more iterations when `b` is close to `n`.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **Large `b` Relative to `n`:** 
   - **Natural Language Invariant:** "When the floor with the secret lab (`b`) is close to the total number of floors (`n`), the number of loop iterations increases significantly, leading to slow performance."
   - **Reasoning:** As `b` is close to `n`, the conditional loop checks lead to a higher number of iterations, increasing the complexity of the dp and prefix sum calculations.

2. **High `k` Value Combined with Large `b` Position:**
   - **Natural Language Invariant:** "If the number of trips (`k`) is high and the forbidden floor (`b`) is near the top floor (`n`), the computation of possible sequences becomes costly due to repeated and extensive loop execution."
   - **Reasoning:** A large `k` value results in more iterations of the outer loop, with each trip requiring extensive dynamic programming updates, which is exacerbated when `b` is large.

3. **Memory and Array Size Constraints:**
   - **Natural Language Invariant:** "When the array dimensions (related to floors `n` and trips `k`) are maximized, there is potential for performance degradation due to large memory operations and nested loop iterations."
   - **Reasoning:** The maximum dimensions of `dp` and `ps` (given by `n` and `k`) result in high memory usage and costly operations, particularly under nested loop conditions.

### Considerations

- The relationship between `b` and `n` drives the complexity, wherein a `b` value near `n` increases the range of floors to be considered, leading to more frequent loop iterations.
- Both `b` and `k` are critical in determining the program's performance; higher values increase computational demand significantly.

By understanding these conditions, developers can identify scenarios where the code might underperform and consider optimizing loop conditions or restructuring the dynamic programming logic to mitigate performance bottlenecks.

### Phase 3: Implement the Natural Language Invariants in C++

Below are the C++ checks implementing the performance-characterizing invariants derived previously:

```cpp
void check_large_b_near_n(int b, int n) {
    if (b >= n - 10) {  // Threshold chosen based on the observation that b near n causes issues.
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - b is close to n!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_high_k_with_large_b(int k, int b, int n) {
    if (k > 4000 && b >= n - 10) {  // Both k and b are large, causing performance issues.
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high k with b near n!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_large_memory_usage(int n, int k) {
    if (n * k > 25000) {  // Arbitrary threshold for large memory usage based on n and k.
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - potential large memory operations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Propagate and Integrate Conditional Checks into the Program

Here is the C++ program with integrated performance checks placed at effective points:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int constexpr mod = 1e9 + 7, max_n = 5e3 + 10;
int dp[max_n][max_n], ps[max_n][max_n];

void check_large_b_near_n(int b, int n) {
    if (b >= n - 10) {  // Threshold chosen based on the observation that b near n causes issues.
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - b is close to n!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_high_k_with_large_b(int k, int b, int n) {
    if (k > 4000 && b >= n - 10) {  // Both k and b are large, causing performance issues.
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high k with b near n!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_large_memory_usage(int n, int k) {
    if (n * k > 25000) {  // Arbitrary threshold for large memory usage based on n and k.
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - potential large memory operations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int32_t main() {
    int n, a, b, k;
    cin >> n >> a >> b >> k;
    
    // Inserted checks for performance invariants
    check_large_b_near_n(b, n);
    check_high_k_with_large_b(k, b, n);
    check_large_memory_usage(n, k);
    
    if (a > b) {
        a = n - a + 1;
        b = n - b + 1;
    }
    dp[a][0] = 1;
    for (int i = 1; i < b; i++) {
        ps[i][0] = ps[i - 1][0] + dp[i][0];
        ps[i][0] %= mod;
    }
    for (int i = 1; i <= k; i++) {
        for (int j = 1; j < b; j++) {
            int aa = min(j + (b - j - 1) / 2, b - 1);
            dp[j][i] += ps[aa][i - 1];
            if (aa >= j) dp[j][i] -= dp[j][i - 1];
            dp[j][i] += mod;
            dp[j][i] %= mod;
        }
        for (int j = 1; j < b; j++) {
            ps[j][i] = ps[j - 1][i] + dp[j][i];
            ps[j][i] %= mod;
        }
    }
    int ans = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i < b; i++) {
        ans += dp[i][k];
        ans %= mod;
    }
    cout << ans;
}
```

**Explanation of Integrated Checks:**
- **`check_large_b_near_n`:** Placed after input, ensures `b` isn't too close to `n`, affecting performance.
- **`check_high_k_with_large_b`:** Checks combination of high `k` and `b` near `n`, both factors that influence loop iteration count.
- **`check_large_memory_usage`:** Monitors potential issues from large array dimensions based on `n` and `k`. These checks are well-placed to avoid impacting performance in critical loops.
