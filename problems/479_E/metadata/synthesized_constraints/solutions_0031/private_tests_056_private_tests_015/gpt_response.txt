=== Invariants Response ===
Based on the given program and the line-level hit counts from both the fast and slow inputs, let's analyze the performance bottlenecks and derive performance-characterizing invariants.

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Function `mod_`:** 
   - The line `while (x > 1000000007) x -= 1000000007;` has a significantly higher hit count with the slow input compared to the fast input (74,990,000 vs 15,002). This suggests that `mod_` is being called excessively or the `while` condition is satisfied frequently in the slow run.

2. **Loops in `main`:**
   - The nested loops at lines 12-18 are executed frequently in both inputs, but more so in the slow input. The hit counts in line 13 (`mod_`) and lines 15-17 (another use of `mod_`) indicate that these operations are hot spots, particularly for the slow input.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Here are the natural language performance-characterizing invariants based on the analysis of the code and constraints:

1. **Invariant: Excessive Modulo Operations**
   - **Description:** "If the sequence of floor movements or calculations requires frequent modulo operations to keep values within bounds (specifically when many terms exceed 1000000007), the program may slow down significantly. This typically occurs when the number of trips `k` is high and calculations result in large intermediate values."
   - **Reasoning:** The high iteration count of the `mod_` function and its high hit count indicate that managing large numbers through modulo reduction is a performance bottleneck.

2. **Invariant: Nested Loop Recomputations**
   - **Description:** "When the number of allowable floors before reaching the forbidden floor `b` is large and the number of trips `k` is maximized (both reaching their upper limits), the nested loops perform an overwhelming number of computations, leading to slow execution."
   - **Reasoning:** The loops iterate over all allowable floors up to `b` for each trip, increasing computational complexity. The hit counts corroborate the heavy execution load.

3. **Invariant: Calculation Overhead in Dynamic Programming**
   - **Description:** "When initializing or updating dynamic programming tables, if the dimensions of the table (related to `n` and `k`) are large, the overhead of updating these tables within nested loops can degrade performance."
   - **Reasoning:** The densely populated dynamic programming table operations are invoked multiple times, stressing the processor with memory operations.

These invariants collectively highlight that the program's slowness is primarily due to repeated, intensive calculations often involving large intermediate numbers and frequent table updates in a dynamic programming approach. This effect is exacerbated under conditions where inputs maximize the constraints (like large `k` and floor counts approaching `n = 5000`).

### Phase 3: Implement Checkers for Performance Invariants

Here, I'll translate the natural language invariants into C++ checks that can be executed at runtime. These checks will help detect conditions that can lead to performance bottlenecks.

#### Invariant 1: Excessive Modulo Operations
- **Checker Code:**

```cpp
void check_modulo_invariant(int x) {
    if (x > 1000000007) {
        std::cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive modulo operations!" << std::endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

#### Invariant 2: Nested Loop Recomputations
- **Checker Code:**

```cpp
void check_nested_loop_invariant(int k, int b) {
    if (k * b > 25000000) { // Assuming a condition that captures excessive loop iterations
        std::cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive nested loop computations!" << std::endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

#### Invariant 3: Calculation Overhead in Dynamic Programming
- **Checker Code:**

```cpp
void check_dp_invariant(int n, int k) {
    if (n * k > 25000000) { // Threshold based on the size of the dp table and potential overhead
        std::cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large dynamic programming table!" << std::endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrate the Checkers into the Original Program

Now we'll integrate these checks into the existing C++ solution to ensure they run at appropriate points in the code, without causing additional overhead within tight loops.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int n, a, b, k, dp[5010][5010], sum[5010][5010];

void mod_(int &x) {
    while (x > 1000000007) x -= 1000000007;
    // Check for excessive modulo operations
    check_modulo_invariant(x);
}

void check_modulo_invariant(int x) {
    if (x > 1000000007) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive modulo operations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_nested_loop_invariant(int k, int b) {
    if (k * b > 25000000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive nested loop computations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_dp_invariant(int n, int k) {
    if (n * k > 25000000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large dynamic programming table!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    scanf("%d%d%d%d", &n, &a, &b, &k);

    // Check for dynamic programming overhead
    check_dp_invariant(n, k);

    if (a > b) a = n - a + 1, b = n - b + 1;
    dp[a][0] = 1;

    // Check for nested loop recomputations
    check_nested_loop_invariant(k, b);

    for (int j = 1; j <= k; j++) {
        for (int i = 1; i < b; i++)
            mod_(sum[i][j - 1] = sum[i - 1][j - 1] + dp[i][j - 1]);
        for (int i = 1; i < b; i++) {
            mod_(dp[i][j] += sum[i - 1][j - 1]);
            mod_(dp[i][j] +=
                 (sum[(i + b - 1) / 2][j - 1] - sum[i][j - 1] + 1000000007) %
                 1000000007);
        }
    }
    for (int i = 1; i <= b; i++) mod_(sum[i][k] = sum[i - 1][k] + dp[i][k]);
    printf("%d\n", sum[b][k]);
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

- **`check_modulo_invariant`:** This check is called inside the `mod_` function to detect excessive modulo operations.
- **`check_nested_loop_invariant`:** Placed before initiating the nested loops to capture excessive recomputations.
- **`check_dp_invariant`:** Inserted after reading inputs to detect potential large overhead in dynamic programming setups.
  
These checks are strategically placed to ensure they do not add significant overhead in the critical parts of the loop, thus aiding in the efficient detection of performance bottlenecks without degrading the runtime performance of the program.
