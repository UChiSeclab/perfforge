## Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

**Analysis:**

1. **Comparison of Line Hit Counts:**
   - Lines 15 to 23 in the first branch of the if-else structure (`if (b > a)`) show a significant number of hits in the slow input scenario (`slow_hit_count: 25000000` for line 16, for example).
   - Conversely, these lines are not executed in the fast input scenario, as indicated by `fast_hit_count: 0`.
   - The loop from lines 29 to 37 in the else branch is heavily hit in the fast scenario but not the slow one.

2. **Pinpoint Lines with High Hit Counts:**
   - Lines 16 to 23, which include nested loops and calculations, are executed intensively during the slow input run.
   - The hit count suggests significant computational efforts on these lines due to frequent iterations over potentially large numbers.

3. **Inference on Data Interactions:**
   - The nested loop structure in the slow path (`for (int j = 1; j < b; j++)`) suggests repeated operations on the arrays `f` and `temp`.
   - The calculations involve indices that depend on the current floor `b` and the available floors, indicating that the problem complexity might involve the way floors are selected when `b > a`.

## Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

**Invariants in Natural Language:**

1. **Invariant: High Iteration Count with Near Maximum `k`**
   - "When the number of trips `k` is large (close to or at maximum allowed, e.g., 5000) and the range of floors available for selection is wide (as when `b` is near `n`), the nested loop structure is heavily exercised, leading to significant computational workload."

2. **Invariant: Dense Range of Accessible Floors**
   - "If the floor with the secret lab `b` is positioned such that a large number of floors are accessible for selection (`b` is near `n`), the calculation involving indices in the loop becomes intensive, potentially slowing down execution due to frequent updates of arrays `f` and `temp`."

3. **Invariant: Large Number of Valid Selections**
   - "When there is a high potential number of valid floor selections due to a large difference between the starting floor `a` and the forbidden floor `b`, particularly when `b > a`, the program's execution time is increased by the need to compute numerous possible sequences."

These invariants help identify conditions under which the program faces performance issues, generalizing the behavior beyond specific input values. The focus is on broad patterns such as the number of trips, the positioning of the secret lab, and the resultant range of accessible floors, staying within the problem's constraints (e.g., `n â‰¤ 5000`).

## Phase 3: Implementing Performance-Characterizing Invariants in C++

Below are the runtime checks implemented in C++ for each of the natural language invariants derived in Phase 2:

```cpp
// Check 1: High Iteration Count with Near Maximum `k`
void check_high_iteration_invariant(long long n, long long b, long long k) {
    if ((b > n / 2) && (k > n / 2)) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high iteration count with large k!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Check 2: Dense Range of Accessible Floors
void check_dense_range_invariant(long long n, long long a, long long b) {
    if ((b > a) && ((b - a) > n / 4)) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - dense range of accessible floors!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Check 3: Large Number of Valid Selections
void check_large_selection_invariant(long long n, long long a, long long b) {
    if ((b > a) && ((n - b) + (a - 1) > n / 4)) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large number of valid selections!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

## Phase 4: Integrating Checkers into the Original C++ Code

Below is the original program with the runtime checks integrated. The checks are inserted at appropriate points to avoid unnecessary overhead:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Check 1: High Iteration Count with Near Maximum `k`
void check_high_iteration_invariant(long long n, long long b, long long k) {
    if ((b > n / 2) && (k > n / 2)) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high iteration count with large k!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Check 2: Dense Range of Accessible Floors
void check_dense_range_invariant(long long n, long long a, long long b) {
    if ((b > a) && ((b - a) > n / 4)) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - dense range of accessible floors!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Check 3: Large Number of Valid Selections
void check_large_selection_invariant(long long n, long long a, long long b) {
    if ((b > a) && ((n - b) + (a - 1) > n / 4)) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large number of valid selections!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
    cin.tie(NULL);
    cout.tie(NULL);

    long long int n, a, b, k, mod = 1e9 + 7;
    cin >> n >> a >> b >> k;

    // Inserting checks after reading inputs
    check_high_iteration_invariant(n, b, k);
    check_dense_range_invariant(n, a, b);
    check_large_selection_invariant(n, a, b);

    long long int f[n + 2], temp[n + 2];
    memset(f, 0, sizeof(f));
    memset(temp, 0, sizeof(temp));

    if (b > a) {
        for (int i = a; i < b; i++) f[i] = 1;
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j < b; j++) {
                long long int ind = (b + j) / 2;
                if (ind * 2 == b + j) ind--;
                temp[j] += (f[ind] - f[j] + mod) % mod;
                temp[j] += f[j - 1];
            }
            for (int j = 1; j < b; j++) f[j] = temp[j] % mod, temp[j] = 0;
            for (int j = 1; j < b; j++) f[j] = (f[j] + f[j - 1]) % mod;
        }
        cout << f[b - 1] << endl;
        return 0;
    }

    for (int i = a; i <= n; i++) f[i] = 1;
    for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
        for (int j = b + 1; j <= n; j++) {
            temp[j] += (f[n] - f[j] + mod) % mod;
            long long int ind = (b + j) / 2;
            temp[j] += (f[j - 1] - f[ind] + mod) % mod;
        }
        for (int j = b + 1; j <= n; j++) f[j] = temp[j] % mod, temp[j] = 0;
        for (int j = b + 1; j <= n; j++) f[j] = (f[j] + f[j - 1]) % mod;
    }
    cout << f[n] << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**
- **Check Placement:** The checks are placed after reading inputs and before entering any computationally heavy loops. This ensures that they can catch potential performance bottlenecks early without adding overhead to critical code sections.
- **Check Logic:** Each check is tailored to detect specific conditions that could lead to slow execution, based on the identified performance-characterizing invariants.
