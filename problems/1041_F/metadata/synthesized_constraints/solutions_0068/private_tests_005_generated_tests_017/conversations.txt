system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

You are given a tube which is reflective inside represented as two non-coinciding, but parallel to Ox lines. Each line has some special integer points — positions of sensors on sides of the tube.

You are going to emit a laser ray in the tube. To do so, you have to choose two integer points A and B on the first and the second line respectively (coordinates can be negative): the point A is responsible for the position of the laser, and the point B — for the direction of the laser ray. The laser ray is a ray starting at A and directed at B which will reflect from the sides of the tube (it doesn't matter if there are any sensors at a reflection point or not). A sensor will only register the ray if the ray hits exactly at the position of the sensor.

<image> Examples of laser rays. Note that image contains two examples. The 3 sensors (denoted by black bold points on the tube sides) will register the blue ray but only 2 will register the red.

Calculate the maximum number of sensors which can register your ray if you choose points A and B on the first and the second lines respectively.

Input

The first line contains two integers n and y_1 (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ y_1 ≤ 10^9) — number of sensors on the first line and its y coordinate.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) — x coordinates of the sensors on the first line in the ascending order.

The third line contains two integers m and y_2 (1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, y_1 < y_2 ≤ 10^9) — number of sensors on the second line and its y coordinate. 

The fourth line contains m integers b_1, b_2, …, b_m (0 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9) — x coordinates of the sensors on the second line in the ascending order.

Output

Print the only integer — the maximum number of sensors which can register the ray.

assistant: To diagnose the performance bottlenecks in the given C program, we'll analyze the differences in line-level hit counts between the slow and fast inputs, and then derive performance-characterizing invariants based on these observations.

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

Upon reviewing the hit counts:

1. **Functions `testaa` and `testab`:** These functions are called significantly more in the slow input (660 and 480 times respectively) compared to the fast input (30 times each). These functions check conditions involving `restoa` and `restob` and are called within nested loops in `solve()`.

2. **Loops in `solve()`:** The loops at lines 32, 34, 40, 48, and 55 are executed extensively in the slow run. In particular, the nested loops at lines 34 and 40 (for 30 iterations each) lead to repeated calls to `testaa` and `testab`.

3. **Function `upa` and `upb`:** These are called from within the main loop of the `solve()` function and update the hash maps `restoa` and `restob`. The cumulative effect of these updates with large sensor data may be contributing to the slowdown.

4. **Preprocessing (`prezao` function):** The calculations within `prezao`, particularly lines 67-76 involving modular arithmetic and array assignments, are invoked heavily due to nested loops ranging over `n` and `m`.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the code analysis and the hit count data, we can derive the following performance-characterizing invariants:

1. **High Frequency of Nested Loop Execution:**
   - **Natural Language Invariant:** When the number of sensors on one or both lines (n or m) is large, and the nested loops in the `solve()` function execute for a high number of iterations, the program may encounter performance slowdowns. This is exacerbated if the conditions in `testaa` and `testab` require extensive computation repeatedly.

2. **Large Data Structures Updates:**
   - **Natural Language Invariant:** If the arrays for sensor positions are large (close to the upper constraint), and the `restoa` and `restob` maps undergo frequent updates within nested loops, the computational overhead can degrade performance significantly.

3. **Preprocessing Overhead:**
   - **Natural Language Invariant:** The preprocessing step `prezao()` may become a bottleneck when `n` or `m` are large and result in substantial iterations over the sensor arrays to compute modular values for each sensor position.

4. **Input Size Impact on Loop Operations:**
   - **Natural Language Invariant:** If `n` and `m` are close to their maximum constraints and the loop conditions in `solve()` are not optimized for early termination (due to sorting or other conditions), the loop operations will increase, causing slowdowns.

### Conclusion

The main performance triggers are the high iteration count of nested loops and the frequent updates and checks performed on large data structures. These triggers are likely to manifest when input sizes approach their upper limits, resulting in a significant number of operations in `solve()` and `prezao()`.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
You are given a tube which is reflective inside represented as two non-coinciding, but parallel to Ox lines. Each line has some special integer points — positions of sensors on sides of the tube.

You are going to emit a laser ray in the tube. To do so, you have to choose two integer points A and B on the first and the second line respectively (coordinates can be negative): the point A is responsible for the position of the laser, and the point B — for the direction of the laser ray. The laser ray is a ray starting at A and directed at B which will reflect from the sides of the tube (it doesn't matter if there are any sensors at a reflection point or not). A sensor will only register the ray if the ray hits exactly at the position of the sensor.

<image> Examples of laser rays. Note that image contains two examples. The 3 sensors (denoted by black bold points on the tube sides) will register the blue ray but only 2 will register the red.

Calculate the maximum number of sensors which can register your ray if you choose points A and B on the first and the second lines respectively.

Input

The first line contains two integers n and y_1 (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ y_1 ≤ 10^9) — number of sensors on the first line and its y coordinate.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) — x coordinates of the sensors on the first line in the ascending order.

The third line contains two integers m and y_2 (1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, y_1 < y_2 ≤ 10^9) — number of sensors on the second line and its y coordinate. 

The fourth line contains m integers b_1, b_2, …, b_m (0 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9) — x coordinates of the sensors on the second line in the ascending order.

Output

Print the only integer — the maximum number of sensors which can register the ray.

assistant: ### Phase 3: Implementing the Natural Language Invariants in C++

For each of the natural language invariants we derived, we will implement a C++ check to detect when the condition of each invariant is met during runtime.

#### Check 1: High Frequency of Nested Loop Execution
```cpp
void check_nested_loop_invariant(int sensorCount) {
    if (sensorCount > 80000) {  // Threshold based on a high number of sensors
        cerr << "Warning: nested_loop_invariant triggered - high frequency of nested loop execution" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

#### Check 2: Large Data Structures Updates
```cpp
void check_large_structure_update(int n, int m) {
    if (n > 80000 && m > 80000) {  // Large numbers close to constraint limits
        cerr << "Warning: large_structure_invariant triggered - frequent updates on large data structures" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

#### Check 3: Preprocessing Overhead
```cpp
void check_preprocessing_invariant(int n, int m) {
    if ((n + m) > 150000) {  // Combined sensor count threshold
        cerr << "Warning: preprocessing_invariant triggered - preprocessing overhead with large inputs" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

#### Check 4: Input Size Impact on Loop Operations
```cpp
void check_input_size_invariant(int n, int m) {
    if (n > 95000 || m > 95000) {  // Threshold close to the maximum constraint
        cerr << "Warning: input_size_invariant triggered - excessive operations due to large input sizes" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrating the Checks into the Original Program

Now, we'll integrate these checks into the existing C++ program at strategic points to capture potential performance bottlenecks effectively.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std; 
const int INF = 0x3f3f3f3f;
const long long int LINF = 0x3f3f3f3f3f3f3f3fll;

const int MOD = 1e9 + 7;
int n, m;
int in1, in2;

### Explanation

These checker functions are implemented following the performance-characterizing invariants derived earlier. They are placed strategically after reading inputs to ensure that the checks do not introduce unnecessary overhead during computation. The checks are designed to trigger warnings and abort execution if conditions indicative of potential performance bottlenecks are met. This setup is particularly useful for testing and debugging in a development environment, especially when running the program with a fuzzer.
