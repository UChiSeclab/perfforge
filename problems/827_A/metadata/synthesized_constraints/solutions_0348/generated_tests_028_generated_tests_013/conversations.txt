system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

Ivan had string s consisting of small English letters. However, his friend Julia decided to make fun of him and hid the string s. Ivan preferred making a new string to finding the old one. 

Ivan knows some information about the string s. Namely, he remembers, that string ti occurs in string s at least ki times or more, he also remembers exactly ki positions where the string ti occurs in string s: these positions are xi, 1, xi, 2, ..., xi, ki. He remembers n such strings ti.

You are to reconstruct lexicographically minimal string s such that it fits all the information Ivan remembers. Strings ti and string s consist of small English letters only.

Input

The first line contains single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of strings Ivan remembers.

The next n lines contain information about the strings. The i-th of these lines contains non-empty string ti, then positive integer ki, which equal to the number of times the string ti occurs in string s, and then ki distinct positive integers xi, 1, xi, 2, ..., xi, ki in increasing order — positions, in which occurrences of the string ti in the string s start. It is guaranteed that the sum of lengths of strings ti doesn't exceed 106, 1 ≤ xi, j ≤ 106, 1 ≤ ki ≤ 106, and the sum of all ki doesn't exceed 106. The strings ti can coincide.

It is guaranteed that the input data is not self-contradictory, and thus at least one answer always exists.

Output

Print lexicographically minimal string that fits all the information Ivan remembers.

} /* line 27 slow_hit_count: 0, fast_hit_count: 0 */


assistant: ### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

Based on the hit count information for the slow input and the fast input, we identify the following key observations:

1. **Outer Loop (`for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)`):** 
   - The loop is executed 21 times for the slow input but only 11 times for the fast input. This indicates that the slow input has more remembered strings, contributing to more iterations.

2. **Nested Loop (Inside `for (int j = 0; j < k; j++)`):**
   - The nested loop runs 40 times for the slow input, compared to 20 times for the fast input. The substantial increase in iterations indicates that the slow input has more positions to process for each string, increasing the workload.

3. **Line 13 (`for (int m = max(poz, p); m < poz + l; m++)`):**
   - This line is hit 331 times for the slow input versus 97 times for the fast input. This loop appears to be a major contributor to the slowdown, as it performs character assignments in `rez`. The increased hit count suggests repeated operations over large spans of `rez`.

4. **Line 20 (`for (int i = 1; i <= len; i++)`):**
   - The loop has 504 hits for the slow input versus 74 for the fast input, indicating the final output construction involves significantly more characters for the slow input.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **Invariant 1: High Number of Remembrance Entries**
   - Natural Language Description: "If the number of strings `n` is large, the program may enter a performance-intensive path due to increased processing of substrings."
   - Rationale: The outer loop scales with `n`, implying that inputs with a large number of remembered strings will inherently lead to more iterations and processing.

2. **Invariant 2: Large Number of Positions for a String**
   - Natural Language Description: "If the number of occurrences `k` for any string is large, the nested loop will perform significantly more operations, potentially slowing the program."
   - Rationale: The nested loop's complexity is directly tied to `k`, suggesting that high values for `k` will increase the workload by expanding the inner operations.

3. **Invariant 3: Extensive Character Overwrites in `rez`**
   - Natural Language Description: "If the combination of string lengths and their positions leads to repeated overwriting of `rez`, performance may degrade due to increased assignments."
   - Rationale: The inner loop performs character assignments over ranges determined by `poz` and `l`. Complex patterns requiring many overwrites increase the number of operations significantly.

4. **Invariant 4: Length of Output String**
   - Natural Language Description: "If the length `len` of the result string is large due to numerous or overlapping substrings, the final construction step may become a performance bottleneck."
   - Rationale: The final loop constructs the output string based on `len`, meaning that a large `len` derived from dense or numerous substring patterns will slow down the output generation step.

By identifying these performance-characterizing invariants, we can predict potential slow execution scenarios and guide optimizations or input handling strategies for future cases.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
Ivan had string s consisting of small English letters. However, his friend Julia decided to make fun of him and hid the string s. Ivan preferred making a new string to finding the old one. 

Ivan knows some information about the string s. Namely, he remembers, that string ti occurs in string s at least ki times or more, he also remembers exactly ki positions where the string ti occurs in string s: these positions are xi, 1, xi, 2, ..., xi, ki. He remembers n such strings ti.

You are to reconstruct lexicographically minimal string s such that it fits all the information Ivan remembers. Strings ti and string s consist of small English letters only.

Input

The first line contains single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of strings Ivan remembers.

The next n lines contain information about the strings. The i-th of these lines contains non-empty string ti, then positive integer ki, which equal to the number of times the string ti occurs in string s, and then ki distinct positive integers xi, 1, xi, 2, ..., xi, ki in increasing order — positions, in which occurrences of the string ti in the string s start. It is guaranteed that the sum of lengths of strings ti doesn't exceed 106, 1 ≤ xi, j ≤ 106, 1 ≤ ki ≤ 106, and the sum of all ki doesn't exceed 106. The strings ti can coincide.

It is guaranteed that the input data is not self-contradictory, and thus at least one answer always exists.

Output

Print lexicographically minimal string that fits all the information Ivan remembers.

Solution (C++ code):
{solution}


assistant: ### Phase 3: Implement Performance-Characterizing Invariants in C++

Let's translate each of the derived natural language invariants into C++ runtime checks:

1. **Invariant 1: High Number of Remembrance Entries**

```cpp
void check_high_number_of_entries(int n) {
    if (n > 10000) { // Assuming a threshold for illustration, since n <= 105
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high number of strings!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

2. **Invariant 2: Large Number of Positions for a String**

```cpp
void check_large_number_of_positions(int k) {
    if (k > 10000) { // Assuming a threshold for illustration, since k <= 106
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large number of positions!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

3. **Invariant 3: Extensive Character Overwrites in `rez`**

```cpp
void check_character_overwrites(int max_movement) {
    if (max_movement > 100000) { // Threshold represents excessive character movements
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive character overwrites!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

4. **Invariant 4: Length of Output String**

```cpp
void check_output_length(int len) {
    if (len > 1000000) { // Threshold represents a very large output length
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large output length!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrate Checker Code into the Original C++ Program

We will insert the checks at strategic points in the program to avoid adding overhead in tight loops.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Checker functions
void check_high_number_of_entries(int n) {
    if (n > 10000) { // Assuming a threshold for illustration
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high number of strings!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_large_number_of_positions(int k) {
    if (k > 10000) { // Assuming a threshold for illustration
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large number of positions!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_character_overwrites(int max_movement) {
    if (max_movement > 100000) { // Threshold represents excessive character movements
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive character overwrites!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_output_length(int len) {
    if (len > 1000000) { // Threshold represents a very large output length
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large output length!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

char rez[2000001], s[2000001];
int main() {
    int n, k, l, len = 0, p, poz;
    cin >> n;

    // Check for high number of entries
    check_high_number_of_entries(n);

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        p = 1;
        cin >> s >> k;

**Explanation:**
- **`check_high_number_of_entries`** is called immediately after reading `n` to ensure we don't handle too many strings.
- **`check_large_number_of_positions`** is invoked inside the loop after `k` is read, ensuring not too many positions for any string.
- **`check_character_overwrites`** is conceptually placed where we might consider maximum movements or overwrites. However, you'd need actual calculation logic for `max_movement`.
- **`check_output_length`** is called before outputting the string to ensure the length isn't excessively large.
