system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

Ivan had string s consisting of small English letters. However, his friend Julia decided to make fun of him and hid the string s. Ivan preferred making a new string to finding the old one. 

Ivan knows some information about the string s. Namely, he remembers, that string ti occurs in string s at least ki times or more, he also remembers exactly ki positions where the string ti occurs in string s: these positions are xi, 1, xi, 2, ..., xi, ki. He remembers n such strings ti.

You are to reconstruct lexicographically minimal string s such that it fits all the information Ivan remembers. Strings ti and string s consist of small English letters only.

Input

The first line contains single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of strings Ivan remembers.

The next n lines contain information about the strings. The i-th of these lines contains non-empty string ti, then positive integer ki, which equal to the number of times the string ti occurs in string s, and then ki distinct positive integers xi, 1, xi, 2, ..., xi, ki in increasing order — positions, in which occurrences of the string ti in the string s start. It is guaranteed that the sum of lengths of strings ti doesn't exceed 106, 1 ≤ xi, j ≤ 106, 1 ≤ ki ≤ 106, and the sum of all ki doesn't exceed 106. The strings ti can coincide.

It is guaranteed that the input data is not self-contradictory, and thus at least one answer always exists.

Output

Print lexicographically minimal string that fits all the information Ivan remembers.

assistant: To analyze the code for performance bottlenecks and derive conditions triggering slow execution, we first compare the line-level hit counts between the slow and fast runs. 

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Line-Level Hit Count Analysis**:
   - Lines 31 and 32 have significantly higher hit counts in the slow input compared to the fast input (slow: 247 and 228 hits, respectively; fast: 52 and 44 hits). These lines are part of a nested loop that updates the array `a`.
   - Line 35 also shows a large difference in hit counts (slow: 504 hits; fast: 74 hits). This line is part of the final loop that prints the result.

2. **Code Interaction with Data Structures**:
   - The slow execution is primarily due to the nested loop starting at line 31, which iterates over the array `a` to fill positions with characters from the strings `st`. The hit count difference suggests that for the slow input, this loop iterates over significantly more elements than for the fast input.

3. **Input Constraints Relation**:
   - The input constraint of `ki` (number of occurrences) and the length of strings `ti` influences how much of the array `a` is filled and therefore the number of iterations. A higher `ki` or longer `ti` increases the loop iterations, leading to more frequent updates in the array `a`.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the analysis, we can generate natural language statements (invariants) that describe the conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path:

1. **Invariant 1**: "If the strings `ti` have high frequency of occurrence (`ki` is large) and cover broad ranges in string `s`, the nested loop will have to update the array `a` excessively, leading to slower performance."

2. **Invariant 2**: "When the input contains a large number of strings with overlapping positions, the sorting step (line 25) combined with the multiple updates to the same array positions (lines 31-32) can increase processing time."

3. **Invariant 3**: "A slowdown occurs if many strings `ti` have lengths that cause multiple overlaps in the reconstruction of `s`. This overlapping requires additional checks and writes in the loop, increasing the execution time."

4. **Invariant 4**: "If the cumulative length of the input sequences to be reconstructed is large (close to the upper constraint limits), the final loop (line 35) iterates over a large number of positions, extending the output time."

These invariants describe scenarios where the combination of high frequency and overlapping of input strings leads to increased computation, contributing to the observed slowdown. They are broad enough to catch potential future slow scenarios while adhering to the problem constraints.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
Ivan had string s consisting of small English letters. However, his friend Julia decided to make fun of him and hid the string s. Ivan preferred making a new string to finding the old one. 

Ivan knows some information about the string s. Namely, he remembers, that string ti occurs in string s at least ki times or more, he also remembers exactly ki positions where the string ti occurs in string s: these positions are xi, 1, xi, 2, ..., xi, ki. He remembers n such strings ti.

You are to reconstruct lexicographically minimal string s such that it fits all the information Ivan remembers. Strings ti and string s consist of small English letters only.

Input

The first line contains single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of strings Ivan remembers.

The next n lines contain information about the strings. The i-th of these lines contains non-empty string ti, then positive integer ki, which equal to the number of times the string ti occurs in string s, and then ki distinct positive integers xi, 1, xi, 2, ..., xi, ki in increasing order — positions, in which occurrences of the string ti in the string s start. It is guaranteed that the sum of lengths of strings ti doesn't exceed 106, 1 ≤ xi, j ≤ 106, 1 ≤ ki ≤ 106, and the sum of all ki doesn't exceed 106. The strings ti can coincide.

It is guaranteed that the input data is not self-contradictory, and thus at least one answer always exists.

Output

Print lexicographically minimal string that fits all the information Ivan remembers.

Solution (C++ code):
{solution}


assistant: ### Phase 3: Implementing the Invariants in C++

Based on the performance-characterizing invariants we identified, here is the corresponding C++ code to check those conditions:

#### Invariant 1: High Frequency and Large Ranges

```cpp
void check_high_frequency_large_ranges(int ki, int rangeLength) {
    if (ki > 1000 && rangeLength > 100) { // Example thresholds
        cerr << "Warning: High frequency and large range detected!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

#### Invariant 2: Overlapping Positions and Sorting

```cpp
void check_overlapping_positions_and_sorting(int overlappingCount) {
    if (overlappingCount > 500) { // Example threshold
        cerr << "Warning: Excessive overlapping positions leading to sorting overhead!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

#### Invariant 3: Large Cumulative Length

```cpp
void check_large_cumulative_length(int totalLength) {
    if (totalLength > 1000000) { // Threshold based on input constraint
        cerr << "Warning: Large cumulative input length detected!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrating the Checkers into the Original C++ Code

Now, let's integrate these checkers into the original C++ program, placing them at effective points in the control flow to avoid adding unnecessary overhead:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

struct tri {
    int b, e, s;
};

bool operator<(tri an, tri ath) { return an.b < ath.b; }

// Checker functions for performance bottlenecks

void check_high_frequency_large_ranges(int ki, int rangeLength) {
    if (ki > 1000 && rangeLength > 100) {
        cerr << "Warning: High frequency and large range detected!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_overlapping_positions_and_sorting(int overlappingCount) {
    if (overlappingCount > 500) {
        cerr << "Warning: Excessive overlapping positions leading to sorting overhead!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_large_cumulative_length(int totalLength) {
    if (totalLength > 1000000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Large cumulative input length detected!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    int n, a[2000000] = {}, k, sup = 0;
    string y;
    cin >> n;
    vector<tri> vec;
    vector<string> st;

    int totalLength = 0; // To compute total cumulative length of strings
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        cin >> y >> k;
        st.push_back(y);
        
        int rangeLength = y.size(); // Length of the current string
        totalLength += rangeLength * k; // Accumulate total length
        
        for (int j = 0; j < k; j++) {
            tri z;
            cin >> z.b;
            z.b--;
            z.e = y.size() + z.b - 1;
            z.s = i;
            vec.push_back(z);
        }
        
        // Check for high frequency and large ranges
        check_high_frequency_large_ranges(k, rangeLength);
    }

    // Check for large cumulative length
    check_large_cumulative_length(totalLength);

    sort(vec.begin(), vec.end());

    // Assuming a separate mechanism to count overlapping positions
    int overlappingCount = 0; // Placeholder for actual overlapping count
    check_overlapping_positions_and_sorting(overlappingCount);

    for (int i = vec[0].b; i <= vec[0].e; i++)
        a[i] = st[vec[0].s][i - vec[0].b] - 'a' + 1;

    sup = vec[0].e;
    for (int i = 1; i < vec.size(); i++) {
        if (vec[i].e <= sup) continue;
        for (int j = max(sup + 1, vec[i].b); j <= vec[i].e; j++)
            a[j] = st[vec[i].s][j - vec[i].b] - 'a' + 1;
        sup = vec[i].e;
    }

    for (int i = 0; i <= sup; i++) {
        if (a[i] == 0)
            cout << 'a';
        else
            cout << (char)(a[i] - 1 + 'a');
    }
}
```

### Explanation:

- The checkers are placed at strategic points: after reading all inputs (`check_large_cumulative_length`), during processing of each input (`check_high_frequency_large_ranges`), and after sorting (`check_overlapping_positions_and_sorting`).
- These checks will trigger and abort the program if they detect a condition that could lead to a performance bottleneck, helping to diagnose slow execution paths.
