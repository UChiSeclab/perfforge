system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

Ivan had string s consisting of small English letters. However, his friend Julia decided to make fun of him and hid the string s. Ivan preferred making a new string to finding the old one. 

Ivan knows some information about the string s. Namely, he remembers, that string ti occurs in string s at least ki times or more, he also remembers exactly ki positions where the string ti occurs in string s: these positions are xi, 1, xi, 2, ..., xi, ki. He remembers n such strings ti.

You are to reconstruct lexicographically minimal string s such that it fits all the information Ivan remembers. Strings ti and string s consist of small English letters only.

Input

The first line contains single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of strings Ivan remembers.

The next n lines contain information about the strings. The i-th of these lines contains non-empty string ti, then positive integer ki, which equal to the number of times the string ti occurs in string s, and then ki distinct positive integers xi, 1, xi, 2, ..., xi, ki in increasing order — positions, in which occurrences of the string ti in the string s start. It is guaranteed that the sum of lengths of strings ti doesn't exceed 106, 1 ≤ xi, j ≤ 106, 1 ≤ ki ≤ 106, and the sum of all ki doesn't exceed 106. The strings ti can coincide.

It is guaranteed that the input data is not self-contradictory, and thus at least one answer always exists.

Output

Print lexicographically minimal string that fits all the information Ivan remembers.

assistant: ### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

Upon analyzing the provided hit count information, the following insights are observed:

1. **Line 17 (`while` loop):** 
   - Slow hit count: 523
   - Fast hit count: 83
   - This loop is executed significantly more times in the slow input. It extends the string `ans` by appending 'a' until it can accommodate the substring `s` starting at position `x`. The repeated extension of `ans` suggests inefficiency, particularly if the input `x` values or substring lengths are large.

2. **Line 23 (`pos.lower_bound`):**
   - Slow hit count: 278
   - Fast hit count: 63
   - The `lower_bound` search in `pos` is called frequently. The set operation may become costly when the set `pos` contains many elements, indicating multiple gaps to fill in `ans`.

3. **Lines 18-19 (`pos.insert` and `ans += 'a'`):** 
   - Slow hit counts: 503
   - Fast hit counts: 73
   - These lines correspond to the `while` loop on line 17. Frequent reallocation of `ans` and insertion into `pos` are indicators of inefficiencies when dealing with large or numerous gaps.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the above analysis, the following natural language invariants are derived to capture potential slow paths of the program:

1. **Invariant on Frequent String Expansion:**
   - **Natural language description:** "If the required position for inserting a substring into `ans` is much larger than the current size of `ans`, causing frequent expansions, the program may experience slowdowns due to repeated memory allocations."
   - This condition is particularly triggered when the difference between the starting index `x` for inserting a substring and the current length of `ans` is substantial, requiring multiple character additions to `ans`.

2. **Invariant on Set Operations:**
   - **Natural language description:** "If the set `pos` contains many elements due to multiple unfilled gaps in `ans`, the frequent operations to locate and fill these positions may slow execution."
   - This condition is likely when there are many non-contiguous gaps to be filled in `ans`, leading to increased set operations.

3. **Invariant on Nested Loop Processing:**
   - **Natural language description:** "If nested loops, especially those iterating over the positions or characters in strings, execute many times due to large or numerous substrings, the computational complexity can slow down the program."
   - This happens when there are numerous substrings to process, each potentially causing multiple iterations to adjust `ans`.

These invariants are designed to capture the conditions under which this program might experience slow performance, abstracting away from specific values and focusing on structural behaviors and patterns that lead to inefficiencies. They align with constraints such as `n <= 100,000` and aim to guide both analysis and future optimizations.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
Ivan had string s consisting of small English letters. However, his friend Julia decided to make fun of him and hid the string s. Ivan preferred making a new string to finding the old one. 

Ivan knows some information about the string s. Namely, he remembers, that string ti occurs in string s at least ki times or more, he also remembers exactly ki positions where the string ti occurs in string s: these positions are xi, 1, xi, 2, ..., xi, ki. He remembers n such strings ti.

You are to reconstruct lexicographically minimal string s such that it fits all the information Ivan remembers. Strings ti and string s consist of small English letters only.

Input

The first line contains single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of strings Ivan remembers.

The next n lines contain information about the strings. The i-th of these lines contains non-empty string ti, then positive integer ki, which equal to the number of times the string ti occurs in string s, and then ki distinct positive integers xi, 1, xi, 2, ..., xi, ki in increasing order — positions, in which occurrences of the string ti in the string s start. It is guaranteed that the sum of lengths of strings ti doesn't exceed 106, 1 ≤ xi, j ≤ 106, 1 ≤ ki ≤ 106, and the sum of all ki doesn't exceed 106. The strings ti can coincide.

It is guaranteed that the input data is not self-contradictory, and thus at least one answer always exists.

Output

Print lexicographically minimal string that fits all the information Ivan remembers.

assistant: ### Phase 3: Implement the Natural Language Invariants in C++

Here are the C++ code snippets for the performance-characterizing invariants derived from the previous analysis:

1. **Invariant on Frequent String Expansion:**
   ```cpp
   void check_expansion_invariant(size_t currentSize, size_t requiredSize) {
       if (requiredSize > currentSize + 100) { // Arbitrary threshold to detect large expansions
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - frequent string expansion!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Invariant on Set Operations:**
   ```cpp
   void check_set_invariant(size_t setSize) {
       if (setSize > 1000) { // Threshold for a large set impacting performance
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large set operations!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Invariant on Nested Loop Processing:**
   ```cpp
   void check_nested_loop_invariant(size_t stringCount, size_t maxSubstringLength) {
       if (stringCount > 100 && maxSubstringLength > 100) { // Arbitrary thresholds
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - extensive nested loop processing!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Integrate the Checkers into the Program

Now, let's integrate the checker functions into the original C++ program. The checkers will be placed at strategic points to detect potential performance bottlenecks effectively without incurring additional overhead in tight loops.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Checker functions for performance bottlenecks
void check_expansion_invariant(size_t currentSize, size_t requiredSize) {
    if (requiredSize > currentSize + 100) { // Arbitrary threshold for expansion detection
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - frequent string expansion!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_set_invariant(size_t setSize) {
    if (setSize > 1000) { // Threshold for large set operations
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large set operations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_nested_loop_invariant(size_t stringCount, size_t maxSubstringLength) {
    if (stringCount > 100 && maxSubstringLength > 100) { // Thresholds for nested loop processing
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - extensive nested loop processing!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void solve() {
    set<int> pos;
    string ans;
    int n;
    scanf("%d\n", &n);
    
    size_t maxSubstringLength = 0; // To track maximum length of substrings
    check_nested_loop_invariant(n, maxSubstringLength); // Initial check for nested loop processing

    for (int i(0), _l((int)(n)-1); i <= _l; ++i) {
        string s;
        getline(cin, s, ' ');

        maxSubstringLength = max(maxSubstringLength, s.size()); // Update max substring length
        
        int k;
        scanf("%d", &k);

        for (int j(0), _l((int)(k)-1); j <= _l; ++j) {
            int x;
            scanf("%d", &x);
            x -= 1;
            
            check_expansion_invariant(ans.size(), x + s.size()); // Check for string expansion
            
            while (x + ((int)s.size()) > ((int)ans.size())) {
                pos.insert(((int)ans.size()));
                ans += 'a';
            }

            check_set_invariant(pos.size()); // Check for large set operations
            
            int now(x);
            while (true) {
                auto it(pos.lower_bound(now));
                if (it == pos.end()) {
                    break;
                }
                int nxt(*it);
                if (nxt - x + 1 > ((int)s.size())) {
                    break;
                }
                ans[nxt] = s[nxt - x];
                pos.erase(nxt);
            }
        }
        scanf("\n");
    }
    cout << ans << endl;
}

int main() {
    solve();
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

- **Expansion Check:** The `check_expansion_invariant` function is placed right before expanding `ans` to ensure that frequent large expansions are detected and aborted.
  
- **Set Operations Check:** The `check_set_invariant` is placed after inserting into the set `pos` and before executing intensive operations on it, capturing cases where the set becomes too large to handle efficiently.

- **Nested Loop Processing Check:** The `check_nested_loop_invariant` is executed at the beginning of the solve function to account for inputs that could lead to extensive processing due to a high number of strings and large substring lengths.

These checks will help identify performance bottlenecks efficiently and can guide optimization efforts.
