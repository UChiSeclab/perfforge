system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

Ivan had string s consisting of small English letters. However, his friend Julia decided to make fun of him and hid the string s. Ivan preferred making a new string to finding the old one. 

Ivan knows some information about the string s. Namely, he remembers, that string ti occurs in string s at least ki times or more, he also remembers exactly ki positions where the string ti occurs in string s: these positions are xi, 1, xi, 2, ..., xi, ki. He remembers n such strings ti.

You are to reconstruct lexicographically minimal string s such that it fits all the information Ivan remembers. Strings ti and string s consist of small English letters only.

Input

The first line contains single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of strings Ivan remembers.

The next n lines contain information about the strings. The i-th of these lines contains non-empty string ti, then positive integer ki, which equal to the number of times the string ti occurs in string s, and then ki distinct positive integers xi, 1, xi, 2, ..., xi, ki in increasing order — positions, in which occurrences of the string ti in the string s start. It is guaranteed that the sum of lengths of strings ti doesn't exceed 106, 1 ≤ xi, j ≤ 106, 1 ≤ ki ≤ 106, and the sum of all ki doesn't exceed 106. The strings ti can coincide.

It is guaranteed that the input data is not self-contradictory, and thus at least one answer always exists.

Output

Print lexicographically minimal string that fits all the information Ivan remembers.

assistant: To analyze the performance bottlenecks and derive the conditions that lead to a slowdown in the given C program, we will follow the outlined approach:

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Compare Line-Level Hit Counts:**
   - The lines with significantly higher hit counts in the slow input compared to the fast input are lines 27, 28, 29, 33, 34, and 35.
   - These high hit counts suggest repeated operations occurring more frequently in the slow input case.

2. **Pinpoint Lines or Functions:**
   - Lines 27-29: In the `if (now <= next)` block, a loop runs from `now` to `next`, printing `'a'` repeatedly. This operation has a high hit count, indicating many iterations.
   - Lines 33-35: Another loop runs from `next` to `next + l`, printing characters from the string `str[pos]`.

3. **Interactions with Data Structures:**
   - The vector `vec` is sorted (line 20) and iterated over, but the hit counts suggest the performance issues stem from the two identified loops which handle repeated output operations.
   - The repeated printing in these loops is connected to the distance between consecutive `next` indices and the length of string segments `str[pos]`.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the analysis above, here are natural language invariants that characterize the performance:

1. **Invariant 1: Repeated Character Output**
   - Natural Language Description: "If there are large gaps between consecutive starting positions of strings `ti`, the program spends significant time filling these gaps with repeated characters."
   - This slowdown occurs because the loop (lines 27-29) repeatedly prints `'a'` to fill each gap, leading to high iteration counts when `next - now` is large.

2. **Invariant 2: Frequent String Insertion**
   - Natural Language Description: "When there are many overlapping or contiguous segments of strings that need to be inserted into `s`, the program encounters a slowdown due to repeated concatenation of these string parts."
   - This is associated with repeated executions of the block (lines 33-35), where segments from `str` must be repeatedly appended to the output, particularly when strings overlap or are close together.

3. **Invariant 3: Overall Input Configuration**
   - Natural Language Description: "If the input configuration results in extensive nesting or interleaving of string positions and lengths, it increases the complexity of constructing the final string, leading to performance degradation."
   - This generalization captures scenarios where complex input patterns exacerbate the operations in the loops, such as filling gaps or managing overlaps.

### Considerations
- Each invariant abstracts away from specific numeric values and instead focuses on patterns within the input data that lead to increased computational effort.
- The suggested thresholds, such as "large gaps" or "many overlapping segments," are relative to the problem constraints (`n <= 100,000` and string lengths/sizes).
- The goal is to provide useful insights into potential performance issues that could arise with different but similarly structured inputs, enabling preemptive detection of slow paths.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
Ivan had string s consisting of small English letters. However, his friend Julia decided to make fun of him and hid the string s. Ivan preferred making a new string to finding the old one. 

Ivan knows some information about the string s. Namely, he remembers, that string ti occurs in string s at least ki times or more, he also remembers exactly ki positions where the string ti occurs in string s: these positions are xi, 1, xi, 2, ..., xi, ki. He remembers n such strings ti.

You are to reconstruct lexicographically minimal string s such that it fits all the information Ivan remembers. Strings ti and string s consist of small English letters only.

Input

The first line contains single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of strings Ivan remembers.

The next n lines contain information about the strings. The i-th of these lines contains non-empty string ti, then positive integer ki, which equal to the number of times the string ti occurs in string s, and then ki distinct positive integers xi, 1, xi, 2, ..., xi, ki in increasing order — positions, in which occurrences of the string ti in the string s start. It is guaranteed that the sum of lengths of strings ti doesn't exceed 106, 1 ≤ xi, j ≤ 106, 1 ≤ ki ≤ 106, and the sum of all ki doesn't exceed 106. The strings ti can coincide.

It is guaranteed that the input data is not self-contradictory, and thus at least one answer always exists.

Output

Print lexicographically minimal string that fits all the information Ivan remembers.

assistant: ### Phase 3: Implementing the Natural Language Invariants in C++

Here, I'll translate the performance-characterizing invariants I described in Phase 2 into C++ runtime checks.

#### Invariant 1: Repeated Character Output
- **Condition:** Large gaps between consecutive starting positions lead to repeated operations.
- **Check Implementation:**

```cpp
void check_repeated_output_invariant(int currentPos, int nextPos) {
    if (nextPos - currentPos > 1000) { // Arbitrary threshold for demonstration
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large gap between positions leading to repeated character output!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

#### Invariant 2: Frequent String Insertion
- **Condition:** Many overlapping or contiguous string insertions.
- **Check Implementation:**

```cpp
void check_string_insertion_invariant(int insertions, int length) {
    if (insertions * length > 5000) { // Arbitrary threshold for demonstration
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive string insertions due to overlapping or contiguous segments!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrating Runtime Checks into the Original C++ Program

Now, I'll integrate these checks into the given C++ program at appropriate points to avoid overhead in tight loops.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Check for large gaps between consecutive starting positions
void check_repeated_output_invariant(int currentPos, int nextPos) {
    if (nextPos - currentPos > 1000) { // Arbitrary threshold for demonstration
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large gap between positions leading to repeated character output!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Check for excessive string insertions
void check_string_insertion_invariant(int insertions, int length) {
    if (insertions * length > 5000) { // Arbitrary threshold for demonstration
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive string insertions due to overlapping or contiguous segments!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    int n, i, j, k, l, now, next, m, pos;
    scanf("%d", &n);
    string str[n + 5];
    vector<pair<int, int> > vec;
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        cin >> str[i];
        l = str[i].length();
        l--;
        scanf("%d", &m);
        for (j = 0; j < m; j++) {
            scanf("%d", &pos);
            pos--;
            vec.push_back({pos, i});
        }
    }
    now = 0;
    sort(vec.begin(), vec.end());
    m = vec.size();
    for (k = 0; k < m; k++) {
        next = vec[k].first;
        pos = vec[k].second;
        l = str[pos].length();
        
        // Place the check for large gaps before entering the loop
        check_repeated_output_invariant(now, next);
        
        if (now <= next) {
            for (i = now; i < next; i++) {
                printf("a");
                now++;
            }
            now = i;
            j = 0;
            for (i = next; i < next + l; i++) {
                cout << str[pos][j];
                j++;
            }
            now = i;
        } else {
            j = now - next;
            for (i = now; i < next + l; i++) {
                cout << str[pos][j];
                j++;
            }
            now = i;
        }
        
        // Check for excessive string insertions after handling string insertion
        check_string_insertion_invariant(j, l);
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### Comments on the Integration:
- The `check_repeated_output_invariant` is placed before the loop that fills gaps with `'a'` to catch large gaps early.
- The `check_string_insertion_invariant` is placed after string insertion operations to monitor excessive work due to overlapping strings.
- The chosen thresholds are arbitrary and should be adjusted based on profiling more representative input sets or domain knowledge.
