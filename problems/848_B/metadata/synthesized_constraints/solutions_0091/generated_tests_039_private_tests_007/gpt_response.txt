### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

Upon analyzing the hit counts, we can identify the lines of code that are significantly more executed during the slow input compared to the fast input:

1. **Lines 19 and 20**: These lines perform sorting operations on `px[i]` and `py[i]`. They both have an extraordinarily high hit count for the slow input (`131,463` for both) compared to the fast input (`16` for both). This indicates that the operations within these loops are likely contributing significantly to the slowdown.

2. **Line 21**: The loop iterating over `mx` is also executed `131,463` times in the slow case versus `16` in the fast case. This suggests that `mx` is significantly larger for the slow input, leading to more iterations and thus more operations.

3. **Lines 23, 26, 28, and 32**: These lines involve iterating over the vectors `px[i]` and `py[i]`. The hit counts for these lines (and the subsequent lines within these loops) are significantly higher in the slow input, further contributing to the performance issues.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Given the analysis above, we can derive the following performance-characterizing invariants that explain the conditions under which the code slows down:

1. **Invariant on Sorting**:
   - **Natural Language**: "The performance of the program degrades notably when the range of indices `px[i]` or `py[i]`, determined by `p - t + N`, spans a large interval. This causes repeated sorting operations over potentially large collections of dancers, especially when they are not evenly distributed across this range."
   - **Explanation**: If the values of `p - t` vary widely, the effective range of indices (i.e., `mx`) becomes large, resulting in multiple sorting operations on empty or small vectors, which cumulatively add up to a higher execution time.

2. **Invariant on Index Range**:
   - **Natural Language**: "The loop iterating over `mx` becomes particularly costly when `p - t + N` covers a large range, increasing the number of iterations in which even empty or redundant operations are performed."
   - **Explanation**: This occurs when the dancers' positions and their waiting times create a wide distribution in `p - t`, especially when the subtraction results in negative or unusually high values that still fall within the valid range due to the addition of `N`.

3. **Invariant on Vector Operations**:
   - **Natural Language**: "The accumulation of operations on vectors `px[i]` and `py[i]` is likely to cause a slow down when the vectors do not get evenly populated across their range, leading to unnecessary iterations over many empty or near-empty vectors."
   - **Explanation**: This condition is exacerbated when the dancers' initial positions and waiting times are such that they cluster only around certain indices while leaving others empty, causing the computational overhead without meaningful operations.

These invariants help to identify the patterns or conditions in the input that lead to a significant slowdown, without relying on specific values from the slow input, but rather focusing on the characteristics that lead to costly operations.

### Phase 3: Implement Invariants in C++

Based on the natural language invariants derived earlier, here are the C++ checker functions:

1. **Invariant on Sorting**: Checking for excessive sorting range.
2. **Invariant on Index Range**: Confirming `mx` is within a reasonable threshold.
3. **Invariant on Vector Operations**: Ensuring vectors aren't operated on excessively for negligible effect.

```cpp
void check_sorting_invariant(int range, int threshold) {
    if (range > threshold) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive sorting range!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_index_range_invariant(int mx, int threshold) {
    if (mx > threshold) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large mx leading to excessive operations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_vector_operations_invariant(int px_size, int py_size, int threshold) {
    if (px_size > threshold || py_size > threshold) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive operations on vectors!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrate Checkers into the Original Program

Now, let's integrate these checker functions into the original C++ code, placing them strategically to avoid performance degradation:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Threshold values based on reasonable assumptions for this problem
const int SORTING_THRESHOLD = 1000; // Example threshold for sorting range
const int MX_THRESHOLD = 1000; // Example threshold for mx
const int VECTOR_OP_THRESHOLD = 1000; // Example threshold for vector operation size

vector<pair<int, int> > px[200010], py[200010];
const int N = 1e5 + 1;
pair<int, int> ans[200010], P[200010];

// Function to check sorting invariant
void check_sorting_invariant(int range, int threshold) {
    if (range > threshold) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive sorting range!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Function to check index range invariant
void check_index_range_invariant(int mx, int threshold) {
    if (mx > threshold) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large mx leading to excessive operations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Function to check vector operations invariant
void check_vector_operations_invariant(int px_size, int py_size, int threshold) {
    if (px_size > threshold || py_size > threshold) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive operations on vectors!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    int n, w, h;
    cin >> n >> w >> h;
    int mx = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        int g, p, t;
        scanf("%d %d %d", &g, &p, &t);
        if (g == 1)
            px[p - t + N].push_back(pair<int, int>(p, i));
        else
            py[p - t + N].push_back(pair<int, int>(p, i));
        mx = max(mx, p - t + N);
    }

    // Check the index range invariant
    check_index_range_invariant(mx, MX_THRESHOLD);

    for (int i = 1; i <= mx; i++) {
        // Check sorting invariant before sorting
        if (!px[i].empty()) {
            check_sorting_invariant(px[i].size(), SORTING_THRESHOLD);
            sort(px[i].begin(), px[i].end());
        }
        if (!py[i].empty()) {
            check_sorting_invariant(py[i].size(), SORTING_THRESHOLD);
            sort(py[i].begin(), py[i].end());
        }
    }

    for (int i = 1; i <= mx; i++) {
        int nn = 0;
        for (auto p : px[i]) {
            P[++nn] = pair<int, int>(p.first, h);
        }
        for (int j = py[i].size() - 1; j >= 0; j--)
            P[++nn] = pair<int, int>(w, py[i][j].first);

        // Check vector operations invariant
        check_vector_operations_invariant(px[i].size(), py[i].size(), VECTOR_OP_THRESHOLD);

        for (int j = px[i].size() - 1; j >= 0; j--) {
            int id = px[i][j].second;
            ans[id] = P[nn--];
        }
        for (auto p : py[i]) {
            int id = p.second;
            ans[id] = P[nn--];
        }
    }
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) printf("%d %d\n", ans[i].first, ans[i].second);
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:

- **Thresholds**: The thresholds (`SORTING_THRESHOLD`, `MX_THRESHOLD`, `VECTOR_OP_THRESHOLD`) are hypothetical and should be tuned based on profiling results or empirical analysis.
- **Placement**: The checkers are placed after input parsing and before any potential costly operations occur, ensuring that they do not affect the speed of tight loops.
- **Abort on Trigger**: If any of these conditions are triggered, the program will output a warning and terminate, which is useful for fuzzing or identifying performance bottlenecks in development.
