=== Invariants Response ===
To address the performance issues in the given C program, let's break down the analysis in two phases as requested:

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Line-Level Hit Count Comparison**:
   - The loop on line 31 looping from -100,000 to 100,000 runs a total of 200,002 times for both fast and slow inputs, indicating a potential performance bottleneck.
   - Inside this loop, line 32 checks whether both vertical (`mp[1]`) and horizontal (`mp[2]`) dancers exist for a given key `i`. This line is hit 200,001 times.
   - The nested operations on lines 33 to 49 are executed far fewer times, but cumulatively they involve sorting and manipulating vectors of dancers when collisions are detected.

2. **Pinpointed Expensive Operations**:
   - Sorting operations on lines 33, 34, and 39 (using `sort` with custom comparators) are computationally expensive and triggered significantly more times on the slow input (hits 3 times compared to 1 time).
   - The use of `reverse` on line 35 and the subsequent vector operations suggest manipulation of potentially large datasets during these iterations.

3. **Inferred Data Interaction**:
   - The performance hit is likely due to the way the dancers' movements and collisions are managed. Once a collision is detected (lines 32 onward), the logic involves costly sorting and reorganizing of dancers, which is exacerbated when there are more simultaneous or overlapping collisions.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the analysis, the following performance-characterizing invariants can be identified:

1. **Invariant on Large Iterative Ranges**:
   - **Natural Language Description**: "The execution becomes slow when the number of unique time intervals, represented by (p[i] - t[i]), is high, causing extensive iterations over the range from -100,000 to 100,000. This leads to repeated checks for possible dancer collisions."
   - **Reason**: With larger ranges or more unique interval points, the loop iterating from -100,000 to 100,000 results in more frequent collision checks and operations.

2. **Invariant on Vector Sorting and Manipulation**:
   - **Natural Language Description**: "Performance degradation is likely when many dancers share collision intervals, causing repeated and costly sorting operations on their states. This is exacerbated when there are many dancers (close to n = 100,000) or when multiple dancers converge at similar positions and times."
   - **Reason**: Sorting operations on lines 33, 34, and 39, combined with vector manipulations, are computationally expensive, especially when repeated frequently due to multiple dancers sharing similar time-space collision points.

3. **Invariant on Dense Collision Points**:
   - **Natural Language Description**: "When the number of dancers interacting at a single collision point is high, the computational overhead from sorting, reversing, and reassigning positions increases, leading to slower overall execution."
   - **Reason**: Dense collision points mean the vectors involved in dancer positions become larger, leading to more intensive computational steps inside the loop from lines 32 to 49.

By focusing on these invariants, one can better understand and potentially mitigate performance issues related to the choreography and collision handling in the dancer simulation.

=== Checker Response ===
### Phase 3: Implementing Performance-Characterizing Invariants in C++

We will implement the natural language invariants derived earlier as runtime checks using C++ code. Here are the checks:

1. **Invariant on Large Iterative Ranges**:
   - **Checker Code**: This invariant checks whether the range of unique time intervals results in excessive iteration.
   ```cpp
   void check_large_iterative_range(int uniqueIntervalCount) {
       if (uniqueIntervalCount > 1000) { // Arbitrary threshold for excessive uniqueness
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to large iterative range!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Invariant on Vector Sorting and Manipulation**:
   - **Checker Code**: This invariant checks for many dancers sharing collision intervals, prompting repeated sorting.
   ```cpp
   void check_vector_sorting(int vectorSize) {
       if (vectorSize > 100) { // Threshold based on typical manageable vector size
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to repeated vector sorting!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Invariant on Dense Collision Points**:
   - **Checker Code**: Checks for too many dancers interacting at a collision point.
   ```cpp
   void check_dense_collisions(int collidingDancers) {
       if (collidingDancers > 10) { // Threshold for excessive dancer collisions
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to dense collision points!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Integrating the Checks into the Original Program

Let's instrument the provided C++ program with these performance checks at strategic points to avoid adding overhead to tight loops.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
using ll = long long;
using vi = vector<int>;
using db = double;
const int N = 2e5L + 11;
int g[N], p[N], t[N];
map<int, vi> mp[3];
int x[N], y[N];
bool cmp(int i, int j) { return p[i] < p[j]; }
using pii = pair<int, int>;
bool cmp2(pii a, pii b) {
  if (a.second == b.second) return a.first < b.first;
  return a.second > b.second;
}

// Checkers
void check_large_iterative_range(int uniqueIntervalCount) {
    if (uniqueIntervalCount > 1000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to large iterative range!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_vector_sorting(int vectorSize) {
    if (vectorSize > 100) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to repeated vector sorting!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_dense_collisions(int collidingDancers) {
    if (collidingDancers > 10) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to dense collision points!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
  ios ::sync_with_stdio(0);
  int n, w, h;
  cin >> n >> w >> h;
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    cin >> g[i] >> p[i] >> t[i];
    mp[g[i]][p[i] - t[i]].push_back(i);
    if (g[i] == 1) {
      x[i] = p[i];
      y[i] = h;
    } else {
      y[i] = p[i];
      x[i] = w;
    }
  }

  // Check the number of unique time intervals
  check_large_iterative_range(mp[1].size() + mp[2].size());

  for (int i = -100000; i <= 100000; i++)
    if (mp[1].count(i) && mp[2].count(i)) {

      // Check if vector sizes for sorting are large
      check_vector_sorting(mp[1][i].size());
      check_vector_sorting(mp[2][i].size());

      sort(mp[1][i].begin(), mp[1][i].end(), cmp);
      sort(mp[2][i].begin(), mp[2][i].end(), cmp);
      reverse(mp[2][i].begin(), mp[2][i].end());
      vector<pii> v;
      for (int j : mp[1][i]) v.push_back({x[j], y[j]});
      for (int j : mp[2][i]) v.push_back({x[j], y[j]});
      sort(v.begin(), v.end(), cmp2);

      // Check for dense collision points
      check_dense_collisions(v.size());

      int t = 0;
      for (int j : mp[2][i]) {
        x[j] = v[t].first;
        y[j] = v[t].second;
        t++;
      }
      for (int j : mp[1][i]) {
        x[j] = v[t].first;
        y[j] = v[t].second;
        t++;
      }
    }
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) cout << x[i] << ' ' << y[i] << '\n';
  return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of Integration:

- **Large Iterative Range Check**: Placed after the data is read and mapped, checking the number of unique time intervals.
- **Vector Sorting Check**: Placed just before sorting operations inside the loop to ensure vectors aren't excessively large.
- **Dense Collision Check**: Placed before reassigning dancer positions to catch excessive dancer collisions.

Each check is strategically inserted to avoid performance drag while effectively monitoring potential bottlenecks, aiding in early detection and debugging.
