### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Line Comparison:**
   - `insert_dancer` function (Lines 7-13) is hit 20 times for the slow input compared to 1 time for the fast input. 
   - The second loop (Lines 22-60) is a major hotspot, especially:
     - Line 33 (`while (inner_iterator != verticals.end())`) is hit 23 times in the slow run compared to 2 in the fast. This suggests that the loop iterates much more for the slow input.
     - Lines 34-35 are hit 20 times, showing that calculation and assignment within the loop are repeated considerably more on the slow input.
     - Inner loop manipulations like `--inner_iterator` and `++inner_iterator` (Lines 57 and 59) also show activity, indicating back-and-forth movement through the set, which can be costly.

2. **Interaction with Data Structures:**
   - The `lines` map and its `verticals` and `horizontals` sets are central to the performance. The frequent insertion and manipulation suggest that inefficient handling of these sets correlates with the slowdown.

3. **Potential Bottlenecks:**
   - The nested loops over dancers in the same line (Lines 22-60) are likely expensive, especially with large numbers of dancers leading to higher collision handling complexity.
   - The alternating between `verticals` and `horizontals` sets suggests an inefficiency when there are significant interactions or collisions.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **Invariant 1: High Number of Interactions in Lines**
   - Natural Language Description: "When there are many dancers with closely aligned waiting times and initial positions, leading to frequent collisions and direction changes, the program can significantly slow down."
   - This invariant captures the essence of increased hit counts due to collisions and back-and-forth direction changes, explaining the increased loop iterations.

2. **Invariant 2: Large Set Size Handling**
   - Natural Language Description: "If there is a high number of dancers on the same line, causing large sets of vertical or horizontal dancers, the program may experience reduced performance due to increased operations on these sets."
   - This invariant points out the inefficiency in handling large sets, which aligns with the repeated manipulations observed in the slow run.

3. **Invariant 3: Extensive Loop Iterations**
   - Natural Language Description: "The performance degrades when the inner loop iterates excessively due to many dancers being processed in the same line, especially with frequent position recalculations."
   - The prolonged loop activity seen in the slow input is indicative of this invariant.

These invariants provide a high-level explanation of the slow execution path, focusing on the interactions and complexities arising with larger input scenarios within given constraints.

### Phase 3: Implement Performance-Characterizing Invariants in C++

Below are the C++ code snippets corresponding to each natural language invariant derived in Phase 2:

1. **Invariant 1: High Number of Interactions in Lines**

```cpp
void check_interaction_invariant(int verticalCount, int horizontalCount) {
    if (verticalCount > 10 && horizontalCount > 10) { // Example threshold for high interaction
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high number of interactions in line!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

2. **Invariant 2: Large Set Size Handling**

```cpp
void check_set_size_invariant(size_t setSize) {
    if (setSize > 50) { // Example threshold for large set size
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large set size!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

3. **Invariant 3: Extensive Loop Iterations**

```cpp
void check_loop_iteration_invariant(size_t iterationCount) {
    if (iterationCount > 100) { // Example threshold for excessive loop iterations
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive loop iterations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrate Checkers into the Original Program

Now, let's integrate these checkers into the provided C++ code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
typedef pair<int, int> pii;
typedef pair<set<pii>, set<pii> > line;
map<int, line> lines;
int n, w, h;

// Checker functions defined above
void check_interaction_invariant(int verticalCount, int horizontalCount);
void check_set_size_invariant(size_t setSize);
void check_loop_iteration_invariant(size_t iterationCount);

void insert_dancer(int type, int pos, int t, int i) {
    int line_number = pos - t;
    if (type == 1)
        lines[line_number].first.insert(pii(pos, i));
    else if (type == 2)
        lines[line_number].second.insert(pii(pos, i));
}

int output[100000][2];

int main() {
    cin >> n >> w >> h;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        int g, p, t;
        cin >> g >> p >> t;
        insert_dancer(g, p, t, i);
    }

    for (auto it = lines.begin(); it != lines.end(); ++it) {
        set<pii> verticals = it->second.first;
        set<pii> horizontals = it->second.second;

        // Check for large set sizes
        check_set_size_invariant(verticals.size());
        check_set_size_invariant(horizontals.size());

        auto outer_iterator = verticals.size() ? verticals.begin() : horizontals.end();
        auto inner_iterator = horizontals.size() ? horizontals.end() : verticals.begin();

        if (!verticals.size()) --outer_iterator;
        if (horizontals.size()) --inner_iterator;

        bool inner_vertical = horizontals.empty();
        bool outer_horizontal = verticals.empty();

        size_t loopCount = 0;

        while (inner_iterator != verticals.end()) {
            // Increment loop counter
            loopCount++;

            // Check for excessive loop iterations
            check_loop_iteration_invariant(loopCount);

            const int index = inner_iterator->second;
            const int final_pos = outer_iterator->first;

            if (!outer_horizontal) {
                output[index][0] = final_pos;
                output[index][1] = h;
                ++outer_iterator;
            } else {
                output[index][0] = w;
                output[index][1] = final_pos;
                if (outer_iterator != horizontals.begin()) --outer_iterator;
            }

            if (outer_iterator == verticals.end()) {
                if (horizontals.empty()) break;
                outer_iterator = horizontals.end();
                --outer_iterator;
                outer_horizontal = true;
            }
            
            if (inner_iterator == horizontals.begin()) {
                inner_iterator = verticals.begin();
                inner_vertical = true;
                continue;
            }

            if (!inner_vertical)
                --inner_iterator;
            else
                ++inner_iterator;
        }

        // Check for high interaction in the line
        check_interaction_invariant(verticals.size(), horizontals.size());
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        cout << output[i][0] << " " << output[i][1] << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

- **Integration of Checkers:** The checkers are called at strategic points:
  - **Set Size Checks**: Right after extracting verticals and horizontals sets (Lines 23-24).
  - **Loop Iteration Check**: Within the loop to monitor excessive iterations (Line 33 onwards).
  - **Interaction Check**: After processing the dancers in a line to detect high interaction (Before final line processing within the outer loop).
  
- **Threshold Values:** These are illustrative and should be adjusted based on empirical data or further analysis. The purpose is to simulate the conditions causing performance issues without hardcoding specific input values.
