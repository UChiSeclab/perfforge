system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

Wherever the destination is, whoever we meet, let's render this song together.

On a Cartesian coordinate plane lies a rectangular stage of size w × h, represented by a rectangle with corners (0, 0), (w, 0), (w, h) and (0, h). It can be seen that no collisions will happen before one enters the stage.

On the sides of the stage stand n dancers. The i-th of them falls into one of the following groups: 

  * Vertical: stands at (xi, 0), moves in positive y direction (upwards); 
  * Horizontal: stands at (0, yi), moves in positive x direction (rightwards). 

<image>

According to choreography, the i-th dancer should stand still for the first ti milliseconds, and then start moving in the specified direction at 1 unit per millisecond, until another border is reached. It is guaranteed that no two dancers have the same group, position and waiting time at the same time.

When two dancers collide (i.e. are on the same point at some time when both of them are moving), they immediately exchange their moving directions and go on.

<image>

Dancers stop when a border of the stage is reached. Find out every dancer's stopping position.

Input

The first line of input contains three space-separated positive integers n, w and h (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000, 2 ≤ w, h ≤ 100 000) — the number of dancers and the width and height of the stage, respectively.

The following n lines each describes a dancer: the i-th among them contains three space-separated integers gi, pi, and ti (1 ≤ gi ≤ 2, 1 ≤ pi ≤ 99 999, 0 ≤ ti ≤ 100 000), describing a dancer's group gi (gi = 1 — vertical, gi = 2 — horizontal), position, and waiting time. If gi = 1 then pi = xi; otherwise pi = yi. It's guaranteed that 1 ≤ xi ≤ w - 1 and 1 ≤ yi ≤ h - 1. It is guaranteed that no two dancers have the same group, position and waiting time at the same time.

Output

Output n lines, the i-th of which contains two space-separated integers (xi, yi) — the stopping position of the i-th dancer in the input.

assistant: To diagnose the performance bottleneck and derive performance-characterizing invariants for the provided C program, let's go through each phase systematically:

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Compare Line-level Hit Counts:**
   - **Line 79:** The loop running from `0` to `maxn` has a significantly higher number of iterations in the slow input compared to the fast input (`131,466` vs. `19`).
   - **Line 80:** The `if` condition checking `e[i].empty()` is executed a large number of times in the slow run (`131,465` times).
   - **Line 83:** The `sort` operation on `e[i]` is performed `7` times in the slow run and `14` times in the fast run, indicating that the sorting process itself might not be a major issue, but the iterations causing these operations are.

2. **Inference:**
   - The main loop (lines 79-95) is being executed excessively in the slow input scenario. This suggests that many indices `i` are being processed, leading to the `sort` and subsequent processing steps.
   - The difference in execution count of the `for` loop in line 79 suggests that `maxn` is significantly larger in the slow run, resulting in more iterations over the `e` array.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the observations from Phase 1, we can derive the following natural language performance-characterizing invariants:

1. **Invariant about Large `maxn`:**
   - **Description:** "If the calculated value of `maxn` is large, resulting in extensive iterations over the data structure `e`, the program may experience slow performance. Particularly, if `maxn` approaches the size of the data and causes repeated checks of empty vectors, performance may degrade."
   - **Explanation:** The large number of iterations over an empty or sparsely populated `e` structure contributes to unnecessary computational overhead.

2. **Invariant about Sparse Population of `e`:**
   - **Description:** "When the array `e` has many empty entries due to the large range of indices used (e.g., influenced by large values of `(q-t)`), there will be excessive checks and iterations, slowing down the program."
   - **Explanation:** Sparse entries lead to many unnecessary `if` checks and iterations in the main loop, adding computational overhead without productive processing.

3. **Invariant about Sorting Operations:**
   - **Description:** "If `maxn` leads to numerous sorting operations on small sublists within `e`, the cumulative cost of these operations can contribute to a slowdown."
   - **Explanation:** While each sorting operation might be efficient, the sheer number of times it is called due to large `maxn` can accumulate, impacting overall performance.

These invariants highlight conditions that lead to inefficient execution paths, with an emphasis on large `maxn` and the resulting impacts on computational steps, especially in terms of iterations and checks on the data structure `e`.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
Wherever the destination is, whoever we meet, let's render this song together.

On a Cartesian coordinate plane lies a rectangular stage of size w × h, represented by a rectangle with corners (0, 0), (w, 0), (w, h) and (0, h). It can be seen that no collisions will happen before one enters the stage.

On the sides of the stage stand n dancers. The i-th of them falls into one of the following groups: 

  * Vertical: stands at (xi, 0), moves in positive y direction (upwards); 
  * Horizontal: stands at (0, yi), moves in positive x direction (rightwards). 

<image>

According to choreography, the i-th dancer should stand still for the first ti milliseconds, and then start moving in the specified direction at 1 unit per millisecond, until another border is reached. It is guaranteed that no two dancers have the same group, position and waiting time at the same time.

When two dancers collide (i.e. are on the same point at some time when both of them are moving), they immediately exchange their moving directions and go on.

<image>

Dancers stop when a border of the stage is reached. Find out every dancer's stopping position.

Input

The first line of input contains three space-separated positive integers n, w and h (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000, 2 ≤ w, h ≤ 100 000) — the number of dancers and the width and height of the stage, respectively.

The following n lines each describes a dancer: the i-th among them contains three space-separated integers gi, pi, and ti (1 ≤ gi ≤ 2, 1 ≤ pi ≤ 99 999, 0 ≤ ti ≤ 100 000), describing a dancer's group gi (gi = 1 — vertical, gi = 2 — horizontal), position, and waiting time. If gi = 1 then pi = xi; otherwise pi = yi. It's guaranteed that 1 ≤ xi ≤ w - 1 and 1 ≤ yi ≤ h - 1. It is guaranteed that no two dancers have the same group, position and waiting time at the same time.

Output

Output n lines, the i-th of which contains two space-separated integers (xi, yi) — the stopping position of the i-th dancer in the input.

assistant: ### Phase 3: Implement Performance-Characterizing Invariants in C++

Here are the C++ runtime checks for the previously defined performance-characterizing invariants:

```cpp
void check_maxn_invariant(int maxn, int n) {
    // Check if maxn is excessively large, causing extensive iterations
    if (maxn > n * 10) { // Assuming a threshold based on observed slow patterns
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large maxn leading to many iterations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_sparse_population_invariant(const vector<int>& e, int threshold) {
    int emptyCount = 0;
    for (const auto& vec : e) {
        if (vec.empty()) ++emptyCount;
    }
    // Check if the array is mostly empty, causing unnecessary checks
    if (emptyCount > threshold) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - sparse population in e array!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrate Checker Code into the Original Program

Now, integrate these checks into the original program at appropriate points, ensuring the checks are placed in such a way that they do not introduce significant overhead within tight loops.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

namespace FastIO {
    const int SIZE = 1 << 16;
    char buf[SIZE], obuf[SIZE], str[60];
    int bi = SIZE, bn = SIZE, opt;
    int read(char* s) {
        while (bn) {
            for (; bi < bn && buf[bi] <= ' '; bi++);
            if (bi < bn) break;
            bn = fread(buf, 1, SIZE, stdin);
            bi = 0;
        }
        int sn = 0;
        while (bn) {
            for (; bi < bn && buf[bi] > ' '; bi++) s[sn++] = buf[bi];
            if (bi < bn) break;
            bn = fread(buf, 1, SIZE, stdin);
            bi = 0;
        }
        s[sn] = 0;
        return sn;
    }
    bool read(int& x) {
        int n = read(str), bf;
        if (!n) return 0;
        int i = 0;
        if (str[i] == '-')
            bf = -1, i++;
        else
            bf = 1;
        for (x = 0; i < n; i++) x = x * 10 + str[i] - '0';
        if (bf < 0) x = -x;
        return 1;
    }
};

const int N = 1e5 + 7, INF = 0x3f3f3f3f, mz = 1e9 + 7, M = 1e5 + 3;
const double PI = acos(0.0) * 2;

struct node {
    int f, p, t;
    node() { p = t = f = 0; }
    node(int a, int b, int e) : p(b), t(e), f(a) {}
    bool operator<(const node& rhs) const {
        if (f == rhs.f) return f == 2 ? p > rhs.p : p < rhs.p;
        return f > rhs.f;
    }
} p[N];

vector<int> e[N << 1];
vector<int> x, y;

struct Edge {
    int x, y;
    Edge() { x = y = 0; }
    Edge(int a, int b) : x(a), y(b) {}
    bool operator<(const Edge& rhs) const {
        if (x) return x < rhs.x;
        return y < rhs.y;
    }
} ans[N];

bool cmp(const int a, const int b) { return p[a] < p[b]; }

// Performance Checkers
void check_maxn_invariant(int maxn, int n) {
    if (maxn > n * 10) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large maxn leading to many iterations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_sparse_population_invariant(const vector<int>& e, int threshold) {
    int emptyCount = 0;
    for (const auto& vec : e) {

    }
    if (emptyCount > threshold) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - sparse population in e array!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    int n, w, h, maxn = -1;
    FastIO::read(n);
    FastIO::read(w);
    FastIO::read(h);
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        int g, q, t;
        FastIO::read(g);
        FastIO::read(q);
        FastIO::read(t);
        p[i] = node(g, q, t);
        e[q - t + M].push_back(i);
        maxn = max(q - t + M, maxn);
    }
    
    // Insert checks after data preparation, before the main processing loop
    check_maxn_invariant(maxn, n);
    check_sparse_population_invariant(e, maxn / 2); // threshold set to half of maxn for example

    for (int i = 0; i <= maxn; i++) {
        if (e[i].empty()) continue;
        x.clear();
        y.clear();
        sort(e[i].begin(), e[i].end(), cmp);
        for (auto it = e[i].begin(); it != e[i].end(); it++)
            if (p[*it].f == 1)
                x.push_back(p[*it].p);
            else
                y.push_back(p[*it].p);

    }
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) printf("%d %d\n", ans[i].x, ans[i].y);
    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation of Integrated Checks:**
- **`check_maxn_invariant`** is placed after calculating `maxn` to ensure it does not grow excessively large, leading to inefficient looping.
- **`check_sparse_population_invariant`** is placed similarly, checking if the data structure `e` is too sparsely populated, thereby wasting computational resources on unnecessary checks.
