### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

Upon analyzing the hit count information, we can observe several patterns and potential inefficiencies:

1. **Line 32 (`for (int i = 1; i <= w; i++)`):** The iteration over the width `w` occurs 50,001 times during the slow input run, compared to just 11 times for the fast input. This suggests that the loop over `w` is a significant contributor to the slowdown, particularly because it checks every column of the stage, regardless of whether any dancers are relevant to that column.

2. **Line 33 (`if (pos[i].size() > 0)`):** This line is evaluated 50,000 times for the slow input, indicating that most columns up to the width `w` are being inspected even when not necessary. Only 10 out of the 50000 iterations actually execute the subsequent loop, suggesting inefficient traversal or unnecessary checks.

3. **Line 49 (`for (; a != mapV.end() && b != mapQ.end(); a++, b++)`):** This loop iterates over maps `mapV` and `mapQ`, which together contain dancers grouped by a certain time parameter `T`. The slow input results in 4 iterations of this loop compared to 2 for the fast input, which is not a major difference, but still significant given the context size.

4. **Line 52 (`for (int i = 0; i < now.size(); i++)`):** This loop iterates 12 times for the slow input compared to 2 for the fast input, suggesting more complex processing due to larger data sizes or more collisions in the slow input.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the analysis, we can derive the following performance-characterizing invariants in natural language:

1. **Inefficient Iteration over Stage Width:**
   - **Invariant:** "If the stage width `w` is large and there are sparse or clustered dancers, the iteration checking each position up to `w` may become inefficient. This is especially likely if the number of dancers is small relative to `w`, leading to many unnecessary checks."
   - This is captured by the repeated execution of the outer loop over `w` even when few dancers are relevant.

2. **Sparse Occupancy of Positions Array:**
   - **Invariant:** "If many positions in the `pos` array remain empty (indicating few dancers start at those positions), iterating over this array becomes a bottleneck. The impact is pronounced when `w` approaches its maximum constraint and dancer positions are either highly clustered or spread out such that many positions are empty."
   - This is seen in the frequent execution of the condition `if (pos[i].size() > 0)`.

3. **Complex Grouping and Processing in Maps:**
   - **Invariant:** "When the maps `mapV` and `mapQ` contain many entries due to complex collision patterns or timing differences, processing these maps becomes more expensive. This can result from high variance in dancer starting times or positions."
   - Illustrated by the map traversal steps and the additional iterations observed during the slow input execution.

4. **Dancer Position and Timing Complexity:**
   - **Invariant:** "Dancers with significantly different starting positions and timing can cause more complex handling within the loops and maps, especially when these variations lead to frequent reassignment or temporal overlaps."
   - This is inferred from the additional work in the loops processing the `pos` array and the maps.

By considering these conditions, one can better anticipate the scenarios under which this code might slow down, even without exact numeric thresholds from the provided inputs. This understanding can guide optimization efforts, such as reducing unnecessary iterations or improving data structure access patterns.

### Phase 3: Implementing Invariant Checks in C++

Below are the implementations of the performance-characterizing invariants as checker functions in C++ based on the natural language descriptions from Phase 2.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Check for inefficient iteration over stage width
void check_stage_width_invariant(int w, int n) {
    if (w > 1000 && n < 10) { // Arbitrary threshold for sparse dancer population
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large stage width with few dancers!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Check for sparse occupancy of positions array
void check_sparse_positions_invariant(const vector<pair<int, int> > pos[], int w) {
    int empty_positions = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= w; i++) {
        if (pos[i].empty()) {
            empty_positions++;
        }
    }
    if (empty_positions > w * 0.9) { // Arbitrary threshold for sparsity
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - many empty positions in pos array!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Check for complex grouping and processing in maps
void check_map_complexity_invariant(int distinctT) {
    if (distinctT > 20) { // Arbitrary threshold for complexity
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - complex map grouping!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrating Checks into the Original Program

Now, let's integrate these checks into the original C++ program.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
const int MAXN = 100005;
map<int, vector<int> > mapV;
map<int, queue<int> > mapQ;
vector<pair<int, int> > pos[MAXN];
pair<int, int> res[MAXN];
struct Tri {
    int g, p, t, id;
} seq[MAXN];
bool operator<(const Tri &a, const Tri &b) { return a.p > b.p; }
int n, w, h;

// Check functions
void check_stage_width_invariant(int w, int n) {
    if (w > 1000 && n < 10) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large stage width with few dancers!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_sparse_positions_invariant(const vector<pair<int, int> > pos[], int w) {
    int empty_positions = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= w; i++) {
        if (pos[i].empty()) {
            empty_positions++;
        }
    }
    if (empty_positions > w * 0.9) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - many empty positions in pos array!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_map_complexity_invariant(int distinctT) {
    if (distinctT > 20) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - complex map grouping!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin >> n >> w >> h;
    
    // Insert stage width invariant check after reading inputs
    check_stage_width_invariant(w, n);

    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++)
        cin >> seq[i].g >> seq[i].p >> seq[i].t, seq[i].id = i;
    sort(seq + 1, seq + n + 1);

    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        if (seq[i].g == 1)
            pos[seq[i].p].push_back(make_pair(seq[i].id, seq[i].t));
        else {
            int T = seq[i].t - seq[i].p + 1;
            if (mapV.count(T) == 0) {
                mapV[T] = vector<int>();
                mapQ[T] = queue<int>();
            }
            mapV[T].push_back(seq[i].p);
            mapQ[T].push(seq[i].id);
        }
    }

    // Insert sparse positions invariant check after populating `pos`
    check_sparse_positions_invariant(pos, w);

    for (int i = 1; i <= w; i++) {
        if (pos[i].size() > 0) {
            for (vector<pair<int, int> >::iterator it = pos[i].begin(); it != pos[i].end(); it++) {
                int T = it->second - i + 1;
                if (mapQ.count(T) != 0) {
                    int id = mapQ[T].front();
                    mapQ[T].pop();
                    mapQ[T].push(it->first);
                    res[id] = make_pair(i, h);
                } else
                    res[it->first] = make_pair(i, h);
            }
        }
    }

    // Insert map complexity invariant check before processing `mapV` and `mapQ`
    check_map_complexity_invariant(mapV.size());

    map<int, vector<int> >::iterator a = mapV.begin();
    map<int, queue<int> >::iterator b = mapQ.begin();
    for (; a != mapV.end() && b != mapQ.end(); a++, b++) {
        vector<int> &now = a->second;
        queue<int> &q = b->second;
        for (int i = 0; i < now.size(); i++) {
            res[q.front()] = make_pair(w, now[i]);
            q.pop();
        }
    }
    
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++)
        cout << res[i].first << " " << res[i].second << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

- **Stage Width Invariant:** We check the stage width and number of dancers immediately after reading inputs.
- **Sparse Positions Invariant:** This check is invoked after the `pos` array is populated to detect sparsity.
- **Map Complexity Invariant:** The complexity of grouping in `mapV` is checked before processing these maps. 

Each check is placed such that it does not add overhead inside tight loops while still ensuring that potential performance bottlenecks are detected early.
