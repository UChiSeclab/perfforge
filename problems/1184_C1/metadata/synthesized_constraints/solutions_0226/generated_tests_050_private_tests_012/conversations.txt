system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

The Cybermen and the Daleks have long been the Doctor's main enemies. Everyone knows that both these species enjoy destroying everything they encounter. However, a little-known fact about them is that they both also love taking Turing tests!

Heidi designed a series of increasingly difficult tasks for them to spend their time on, which would allow the Doctor enough time to save innocent lives!

The funny part is that these tasks would be very easy for a human to solve.

The first task is as follows. There are some points on the plane. All but one of them are on the boundary of an axis-aligned square (its sides are parallel to the axes). Identify that point.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10).

Each of the following 4n + 1 lines contains two integers x_i, y_i (0 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 50), describing the coordinates of the next point.

It is guaranteed that there are at least n points on each side of the square and all 4n + 1 points are distinct.

Output

Print two integers — the coordinates of the point that is not on the boundary of the square.

assistant: To diagnose and produce performance-characterizing invariants for the given C program, we need to analyze and understand where the code might be inefficient when handling the slow input. Below is a breakdown of the analysis and the derived invariants:

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Line-By-Line Analysis**:
   - **Nested Loops (lines 20-23)**: The loops are over `i1`, `i2`, `j1`, and `j2`, which iterate over the range defined by `minx`, `maxx`, `miny`, and `maxy`. These loops contribute significantly to the hit count discrepancy between the slow and fast inputs.
   - **Inner Loop Condition (line 26)**: The loop iterates through the points, and its termination condition depends on the variable `cnt`, which if set to `1`, breaks the loop. High hit counts here suggest frequent iterations.
   - **Conditional Checks (lines 27-30)**: These involve multiple comparisons and logical operations, which can be computationally expensive, especially within deeply nested loops.

2. **Interaction with Data Structures**:
   - The array `point` is accessed frequently within these loops, and the operations on `minx`, `maxx`, `miny`, and `maxy` create a large search space.

3. **Recursion and Search Space**:
   - The nested loops create a large search space, making this a combinatorially expensive operation that scales poorly with the input size.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the analysis, here are the performance-characterizing invariants in natural language:

1. **Invariant #1: Large Search Space**:
   - **Description**: "If the range between the minimum and maximum values of x or y coordinates is large, the nested loops iterate over a wide range, increasing the computational cost dramatically."
   - **Threshold Suggestion**: The range of values (`maxx - minx` or `maxy - miny`) approaching the upper limit of input constraints (e.g., close to 50).

2. **Invariant #2: High Complexity in Conditional Checks**:
   - **Description**: "When multiple points exist with close proximity, the program performs excessive checks for boundary conditions within nested loops, leading to increased computation time."
   - **Threshold Suggestion**: When distinct coordinates are densely packed, causing conditions to be frequently evaluated.

3. **Invariant #3: Inefficient Early Exit Conditions**:
   - **Description**: "The algorithm may perform unnecessary computations if the early exit conditions (i.e., finding `cnt == 1`) in the inner loops are not efficiently met due to point distribution."
   - **Threshold Suggestion**: Probability of `cnt` reaching 1 should be optimized by better bounding strategies, rather than exhaustive checks.

### Implementation Considerations

- **Avoiding Performance Degradation**: Place checks outside the innermost loops to avoid additional overhead.
- **Fuzzing Utility**: These checks can guide fuzzers in generating inputs that hit these slow paths, helping identify other potential slowdowns.

By understanding these performance triggers, developers can refactor or optimize the algorithm to handle such cases more efficiently.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
The Cybermen and the Daleks have long been the Doctor's main enemies. Everyone knows that both these species enjoy destroying everything they encounter. However, a little-known fact about them is that they both also love taking Turing tests!

Heidi designed a series of increasingly difficult tasks for them to spend their time on, which would allow the Doctor enough time to save innocent lives!

The funny part is that these tasks would be very easy for a human to solve.

The first task is as follows. There are some points on the plane. All but one of them are on the boundary of an axis-aligned square (its sides are parallel to the axes). Identify that point.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10).

Each of the following 4n + 1 lines contains two integers x_i, y_i (0 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 50), describing the coordinates of the next point.

It is guaranteed that there are at least n points on each side of the square and all 4n + 1 points are distinct.

Output

Print two integers — the coordinates of the point that is not on the boundary of the square.

assistant: ### Phase 3: Implement the Natural Language Invariants in C++

Based on the performance-characterizing invariants derived earlier, we will now implement these invariants as runtime checks in C++.

#### Invariant #1: Large Search Space
```cpp
void check_large_search_space(int minx, int maxx, int miny, int maxy) {
    if ((maxx - minx) * (maxy - miny) > 1000) { // Arbitrary threshold to detect large loops.
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to large search space!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

#### Invariant #2: High Complexity in Conditional Checks
```cpp
void check_dense_proximity(int pointCount, int n) {
    if (pointCount > 4 * n) { // If there are more points than expected on the square, checks will be frequent.
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to dense proximity of points!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

#### Invariant #3: Inefficient Early Exit Conditions
```cpp
void check_inefficient_early_exit(int searchSpaceSize, int n) {
    if (searchSpaceSize > 10 * n) { // Arbitrary threshold to detect inefficient early exits.
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to inefficient early exit!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrate Checker Code with the Original Program

Now we will integrate the above checker functions into the original C++ program, placing them at strategic points to avoid unnecessary overhead.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
using ll = long long;
const int INF = 0x3f3f3f3f;
struct P {
    int x, y;
} point[41];

// Checkers
void check_large_search_space(int minx, int maxx, int miny, int maxy) {
    if ((maxx - minx) * (maxy - miny) > 1000) { // Arbitrary threshold to detect large loops.
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to large search space!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_dense_proximity(int pointCount, int n) {
    if (pointCount > 4 * n) { // If there are more points than expected on the square, checks will be frequent.
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to dense proximity of points!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_inefficient_early_exit(int searchSpaceSize, int n) {
    if (searchSpaceSize > 10 * n) { // Arbitrary threshold to detect inefficient early exits.
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to inefficient early exit!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    ios::sync_with_stdio(0);
    cin.tie(0);
    int n, maxx = INT_MIN, maxy = INT_MIN, minx = INT_MAX, miny = INT_MAX;
    cin >> n;
    for (auto i = (0); i < (4 * n + 1); ++i) {
        cin >> point[i].x >> point[i].y;
        maxx = max(maxx, point[i].x);
        maxy = max(maxy, point[i].y);
        minx = min(minx, point[i].x);
        miny = min(miny, point[i].y);
    }
    
    // Place checker after gathering input and finding min/max values
    check_large_search_space(minx, maxx, miny, maxy);
    check_dense_proximity(4 * n + 1, n);

    for (auto i1 = (minx); i1 < (maxx + 1); ++i1)
        for (auto i2 = (i1); i2 < (maxx + 1); ++i2)
            for (auto j1 = (miny); j1 < (maxy + 1); ++j1)
                for (auto j2 = (j1); j2 < (maxy + 1); ++j2) {
                    P tmp;
                    int cnt = 0;
                    for (int k = 0; cnt <= 1 && k < 4 * n + 1; ++k)
                        if ((i1 != point[k].x && i2 != point[k].x && j1 != point[k].y &&
                             j2 != point[k].y) ||
                            i1 > point[k].x || i2 < point[k].x || j1 > point[k].y ||
                            j2 < point[k].y) {
                            tmp = point[k];
                            ++cnt;
                        }
                    // Check inefficient early exit condition inside the loop
                    check_inefficient_early_exit((maxx - minx + 1) * (maxy - miny + 1), n);
                    if (cnt == 1) {
                        cout << tmp.x << ' ' << tmp.y;
                        return 0;
                    }
                }
}
```

### Explanation
- **`check_large_search_space`**: Invoked after determining the bounds for iteration, ensuring that the search space isn't excessively large.
- **`check_dense_proximity`**: Invoked after reading the input to ensure the proximity of points doesn't lead to performance degradation.
- **`check_inefficient_early_exit`**: Integrated within the loop to warn if the efficient early exit conditions aren't being met, without adding overhead to every iteration.
