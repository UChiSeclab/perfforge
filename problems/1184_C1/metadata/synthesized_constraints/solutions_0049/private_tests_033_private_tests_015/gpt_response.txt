### Performance Analysis and Diagnostics

#### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

By comparing the hit counts between the fast and slow inputs, we notice that:

1. The nested loops starting at line 12, particularly lines 13 and 14, show significantly higher hit counts for the slow input. This indicates that the loops are iterating a lot more times for the slow input.
2. The innermost loop at line 18, which iterates over all points `4*n + 1`, is heavily executed, contributing to the slowdown.
3. The check conditions on lines 19-28 involve a lot of comparisons for each point, resulting in a high computational load.
4. The conditional check `if (cnt == 4 * n)` on line 31 and subsequent loop on line 32 are crucial points where we determine the uniqueness of points on the boundary versus the interior.

The main bottleneck appears to be the exhaustive search for the square configuration by iterating over all potential starting points (`o` and `i`), with varying square sizes (`a`).

#### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the above observations, here are some performance-characterizing invariants in natural language:

1. **High Iteration Space for Square Detection**: 
   - "If the number of iterations over potential square starting points (i, o) and side lengths (a) is very high, the program may slow down. This is particularly evident when multiple points lead to excessive computations within nested loops." 

2. **Innermost Loop Iterations**:
   - "If the algorithm requires repeated checks across all points (`4*n + 1`) for each potential square, the computational load increases significantly, leading to slower performance."

3. **Boundary vs. Interior Point Checks**:
   - "When the condition to find the interior point (`cnt == 4 * n`) is triggered frequently, it suggests that too many potential squares are being considered, slowing down the identification process."

4. **Grid Density and Configuration Complexity**:
   - "If the configuration of points is such that many grid positions need to be evaluated to confirm the square boundary, the time complexity will increase, resulting in slower execution."

These invariants focus on the interplay between the nested loops and the density of potential solutions that must be processed to identify the unique interior point. They derive from the structure of the algorithms and how they scale with input complexity, rather than specific input values. By understanding these patterns, future cases that exhibit similar characteristics can be better anticipated and optimized.

### Phase 3: Implementing Natural Language Invariants as Checkers

Below are the C++ code implementations for the performance-characterizing invariants derived earlier. These checkers will be integrated into the program to detect potential performance bottlenecks.

```cpp
void check_iteration_space_invariant(int o_hits, int i_hits) {
    if (o_hits > 5 && i_hits > 60) {  // Example thresholds based on the original observations
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to high iteration space over 'o' and 'i'." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_innermost_loop_invariant(int j_iterations) {
    if (j_iterations > 600000) {  // Example threshold based on aggregated hit counts
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to excessive innermost loop iterations." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_boundary_check_invariant(int cnt_evaluations) {
    if (cnt_evaluations > 16000) {  // Example threshold based on aggregated hit counts for cnt evaluations
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to frequent boundary check evaluations." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_grid_density_invariant(int a_hits) {
    if (a_hits > 15000) {  // Example threshold based on aggregated hit counts for different 'a' values
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to grid density and configuration complexity." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Propagate and Insert Conditional Checks in the Original Program

Below is the instrumented code with the performance checkers integrated. These checks are strategically placed to highlight potential performance bottlenecks without adding overhead to tight loops.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Function prototypes for the checkers
void check_iteration_space_invariant(int o_hits, int i_hits);
void check_innermost_loop_invariant(int j_iterations);
void check_boundary_check_invariant(int cnt_evaluations);
void check_grid_density_invariant(int a_hits);

int main() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  vector<pair<int, int>> v;
  for (int i = 0; i < 4 * n + 1; i++) {
    int a, b;
    scanf("%d%d", &a, &b);
    v.push_back(make_pair(a, b));
  }

  int o_hits = 0;
  int i_hits = 0;
  int total_j_iterations = 0;
  int total_cnt_evaluations = 0;
  int total_a_hits = 0;

  for (int o = 0; o <= 50; o++) {
    o_hits++;
    for (int i = 0; i <= 50; i++) {
      i_hits++;
      for (int a = 2; a <= 50; a++) {
        total_a_hits++;
        int x1 = i, x2 = i + a, y1 = o, y2 = o + a;
        vector<bool> vis(4 * n + 1, 0);
        int cnt = 0;
        for (int j = 0; j < 4 * n + 1; j++) {
          total_j_iterations++;
          if ((v[j].first == x1 || v[j].first == x2) && y1 <= v[j].second &&
              v[j].second <= y2) {
            vis[j] = 1;
            cnt++;
            continue;
          }
          if ((v[j].second == y1 || v[j].second == y2) && x1 <= v[j].first &&
              v[j].first <= x2) {
            vis[j] = 1;
            cnt++;
          }
        }

        total_cnt_evaluations++;
        if (cnt == 4 * n) {
          for (int j = 0; j < 4 * n + 1; j++) {
            if (vis[j] == 0) {
              cout << v[j].first << " " << v[j].second << endl;
              return 0;
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }

  // Place checkers outside heavy loops to avoid additional overhead inside critical sections
  check_iteration_space_invariant(o_hits, i_hits);
  check_innermost_loop_invariant(total_j_iterations);
  check_boundary_check_invariant(total_cnt_evaluations);
  check_grid_density_invariant(total_a_hits);

  return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of the Instrumented Code

- **Checkers**: Each checker function is called after the loops to ensure we don't introduce unnecessary performance degradation inside any critical section.
- **Metrics Collection**: Variables such as `o_hits`, `i_hits`, `total_j_iterations`, `total_cnt_evaluations`, and `total_a_hits` track relevant operations' counts, helping to detect when performance bottlenecks might occur based on heuristic thresholds.
- **Abort on Detection**: Each checker will abort the program if a potential performance issue is detected, providing immediate feedback during execution.
