system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

The Cybermen and the Daleks have long been the Doctor's main enemies. Everyone knows that both these species enjoy destroying everything they encounter. However, a little-known fact about them is that they both also love taking Turing tests!

Heidi designed a series of increasingly difficult tasks for them to spend their time on, which would allow the Doctor enough time to save innocent lives!

The funny part is that these tasks would be very easy for a human to solve.

The first task is as follows. There are some points on the plane. All but one of them are on the boundary of an axis-aligned square (its sides are parallel to the axes). Identify that point.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10).

Each of the following 4n + 1 lines contains two integers x_i, y_i (0 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 50), describing the coordinates of the next point.

It is guaranteed that there are at least n points on each side of the square and all 4n + 1 points are distinct.

Output

Print two integers — the coordinates of the point that is not on the boundary of the square.

assistant: ### Phase 1: Identifying Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

From the provided hit count information, we observe the following:
1. **Nested Loops (lines 9-11):** The loops over `i`, `j`, and `k` have significantly higher hit counts in the slow input compared to the fast input. For the slow input:
   - Outer loop (`i`): 12 iterations compared to 1 in the fast input.
   - Middle loop (`j`): 584 iterations compared to 2 in the fast input.
   - Inner loop (`k`): 29,780 iterations compared to 98 in the fast input.

2. **Innermost Loop (lines 14-19):** The loop iterating over `l` is hit 1,226,736 times in the slow input compared to 3,686 in the fast input, indicating that this segment interacts heavily with the data structure (`ar` array) and the conditions checked here cause a significant slowdown.

3. **Conditional Checks (lines 15-19):** The complex condition within the innermost loop that involves multiple comparisons against the `ar[l]` elements appears to be a critical point, as it is evaluated very frequently for the slow input.

### Phase 2: Deriving Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the analysis above, we can derive the following performance-characterizing invariants:

1. **Invariant 1: High Iteration Over Search Space**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "When the search space, defined by the grid size being iterated over (`i`, `j`, `k`), expands significantly, resulting in a high number of iterations, the program slows down. This is particularly evident if the nested loops iterate over a larger coordinate space."
   - **Condition:** The nested loops iterate over a full 51x51x51 coordinate space, causing excessive computation.

2. **Invariant 2: Complex Condition Evaluation**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "If the conditional logic inside the innermost loop evaluates repeatedly across many data points, especially when the search area is large, it can lead to performance degradation."
   - **Condition:** The condition within the loop checks multiple boundaries, and if it's evaluated very often with a high number of points, it contributes to slowdown.

3. **Invariant 3: Inefficient Data Structure Access**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "When each element of the array is frequently checked against complex conditions, particularly across a large loop space, it incurs significant overhead."
   - **Condition:** Each point (`ar[l]`) is checked multiple times for boundary conditions, and with a larger `n` (close to 10), this significantly increases computational overhead.

#### Conclusion

These invariants help us understand that the slow path in the code is primarily triggered by a large search space combined with complex condition evaluations across a significant number of data points. The performance issues are less about the specific values of the input and more about the structure and extent of the loops and condition checks.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
The Cybermen and the Daleks have long been the Doctor's main enemies. Everyone knows that both these species enjoy destroying everything they encounter. However, a little-known fact about them is that they both also love taking Turing tests!

Heidi designed a series of increasingly difficult tasks for them to spend their time on, which would allow the Doctor enough time to save innocent lives!

The funny part is that these tasks would be very easy for a human to solve.

The first task is as follows. There are some points on the plane. All but one of them are on the boundary of an axis-aligned square (its sides are parallel to the axes). Identify that point.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10).

Each of the following 4n + 1 lines contains two integers x_i, y_i (0 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 50), describing the coordinates of the next point.

It is guaranteed that there are at least n points on each side of the square and all 4n + 1 points are distinct.

Output

Print two integers — the coordinates of the point that is not on the boundary of the square.

assistant: ### Phase 3: Implementing Invariants as Runtime Checks in C++

Below are the C++ code snippets to implement the performance-characterizing invariants derived previously. Each snippet includes a runtime check to detect potential performance bottlenecks.

1. **Invariant 1: High Iteration Over Search Space**
   ```cpp
   void check_search_space_invariant(int i, int j, int k) {
       if (i > 1 && j > 1 && k > 1) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large search space." << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Invariant 2: Complex Condition Evaluation**
   ```cpp
   void check_complex_condition_invariant(int evalCount) {
       if (evalCount > 1000000) { // This threshold is an example; adjust based on observed behavior.
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive condition evaluations." << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Invariant 3: Inefficient Data Structure Access**
   ```cpp
   void check_data_structure_invariant(int n) {
       if (n > 8) { // As n approaches its upper constraint, the data structure access becomes more intensive.
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - intensive data structure access." << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Integrating Runtime Checks into the Original C++ Program

Below is the original program with integrated runtime checks. I've placed the checks at appropriate locations to capture potential slowdowns without adding overhead in tight loops.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

void check_search_space_invariant(int i, int j, int k) {
    if (i > 1 && j > 1 && k > 1) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large search space." << endl;
        abort();

### Explanation of Integration

- **Invariant 1 (Search Space):** Placed within the nested loops to abort if the search space grows unexpectedly large, but early in the loops to avoid excessive checks.
- **Invariant 2 (Condition Evaluation):** An evaluation counter (`evalCount`) is used to track the number of times the complex condition within the loop block is evaluated. This is checked after every possible execution cycle.
- **Invariant 3 (Data Structure Access):** Placed after input reading to ensure that as `n` approaches its upper limit, a warning is issued due to potentially excessive data structure access.
