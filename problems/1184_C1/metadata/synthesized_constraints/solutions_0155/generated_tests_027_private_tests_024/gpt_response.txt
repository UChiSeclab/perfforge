=== Invariants Response ===
To analyze the C program and identify performance issues, let's follow the two-phase approach:

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Comparison of Hit Counts:** 
   - The slow input has significantly higher hit counts in the nested loops starting from line 12 to line 17 compared to the fast input. Specifically, the innermost loop on line 17 has an especially high hit count (`slow_hit_count: 29090544` vs. `fast_hit_count: 186086`).
   
2. **Lines/Functions with More Hits:**
   - Lines 12-15 are setting up a sequence of nested loops. The hit counts show that line 15 (`for (int y98911 = y12098; y98911 <= 50; y98911++)`) is executed over 718,000 times for the slow input and only 4,993 times for the fast input. This indicates significant performance degradation.
   - The loop on line 17 (`for (int k = 1; k <= 4 * n + 1; k++)`) is repeatedly executed for each combination of `(x20390, y12098, x21981, y98911)`, contributing to the high hit count on this line.

3. **Interactions with Data Structures:**
   - The nested loops are essentially brute-force searching for a configuration of points forming a square boundary such that all but one point lies on the boundary. Each iteration of the innermost loop checks all points to see if they define the boundary.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the analysis and constraints (e.g., n â‰¤ 10, coordinates between 0 and 50), we can derive the following performance-characterizing invariants:

1. **Excessive Nested Loop Iterations:** 
   - **Invariant:** "If the points create scenarios where the search space for potential square boundaries is exhaustively large, especially when there are many possible configurations of `(x, y)` pairs between the minimum and maximum coordinates, the program may slow down significantly."
   - **Explanation:** The program uses nested loops to systematically explore all possible rectangle boundaries, and this becomes highly inefficient as the number of possible boundaries grows considerably with increased point variability.

2. **Repeated Boundary Checks:**
   - **Invariant:** "When there is a high degree of variability in point positions leading to many potential boundaries, the program performs repeated boundary checks, which can degrade performance."
   - **Explanation:** Each point is checked multiple times against different boundary conditions within the nested loops, which leads to repetitive calculations and potential performance bottlenecks.

3. **Sparse Distribution of Points:**
   - **Invariant:** "Situations where points are sparsely distributed across the maximum coordinate range can cause the program to perform unnecessary checks for every possible boundary configuration, slowing down the detection of the non-boundary point."
   - **Explanation:** The program's logic inherently checks every possible square defined by two corner points, and when points are spread out, this results in checking many non-promising configurations.

These invariants provide insights into how the program's performance can degrade under specific conditions related to input patterns, such as the distribution and variability of points. By addressing these inefficiencies, future performance slowdowns can be mitigated.

=== Checker Response ===
### Phase 3: Implement the Natural Language Invariants in C++

Let's translate the performance-characterizing invariants from Phase 2 into runtime checks using C++.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstdio>
using namespace std;

// Function to check excessive nested loop iterations
void check_excessive_iterations(int x20390, int y12098, int x21981, int y98911) {
    if ((x21981 - x20390) > 25 || (y98911 - y12098) > 25) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive nested loop iterations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Function to check repeated boundary checks condition
void check_repeated_boundary_checks(int s1, int s2, int s3, int s4, int n) {
    if (s1 < n || s2 < n || s3 < n || s4 < n) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - repeated boundary checks!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Function to check sparse distribution of points
void check_sparse_distribution(int cnt, int n) {
    if (cnt > 1) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - sparse distribution of points!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrate the Checker Code into the Original Program

Now, insert the checker functions into the provided C++ code, ensuring they are placed after input reading and before entering heavy loops.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstdio>
using namespace std;

int n;
int xx[105], yy[105];
int cnt, po;
int s1, s2, s3, s4;

void check_excessive_iterations(int x20390, int y12098, int x21981, int y98911) {
    if ((x21981 - x20390) > 25 || (y98911 - y12098) > 25) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive nested loop iterations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_repeated_boundary_checks(int s1, int s2, int s3, int s4, int n) {
    if (s1 < n || s2 < n || s3 < n || s4 < n) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - repeated boundary checks!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_sparse_distribution(int cnt, int n) {
    if (cnt > 1) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - sparse distribution of points!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    scanf("%d", &n);
    for (int i = 1; i <= 4 * n + 1; i++) {
        scanf("%d%d", &xx[i], &yy[i]);
    }
    
    for (int x20390 = 0; x20390 <= 50; x20390++) {
        for (int y12098 = 0; y12098 <= 50; y12098++) {
            for (int x21981 = x20390; x21981 <= 50; x21981++) {
                for (int y98911 = y12098; y98911 <= 50; y98911++) {
                    check_excessive_iterations(x20390, y12098, x21981, y98911);
                    
                    s1 = s2 = s3 = s4 = cnt = po = 0;
                    for (int k = 1; k <= 4 * n + 1; k++) {
                        int x = xx[k], y = yy[k];
                        int f = 0;
                        if (x == x20390 && y >= y12098 && y <= y98911) {
                            s1++;
                            f = 1;
                        }
                        if (x == x21981 && y >= y12098 && y <= y98911) {
                            s2++;
                            f = 1;
                        }
                        if (y == y12098 && x >= x20390 && x <= x21981) {
                            s3++;
                            f = 1;
                        }
                        if (y == y98911 && x >= x20390 && x <= x21981) {
                            s4++;
                            f = 1;
                        }
                        if (!f) cnt++, po = k;
                    }
                    
                    // Check repeated boundary conditions
                    check_repeated_boundary_checks(s1, s2, s3, s4, n);
                    
                    // Check if exactly one point isn't on the boundary
                    check_sparse_distribution(cnt, n);
                    
                    if (s1 >= n && s2 >= n && s3 >= n && s4 >= n && cnt == 1) {
                        printf("%d %d\n", xx[po], yy[po]);
                        return 0;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation
- **`check_excessive_iterations`:** Ensures that the area of the rectangle being considered doesn't grow excessively large, indicating too many configurations being checked.
- **`check_repeated_boundary_checks`:** Validates that there are enough points on each side of the square boundary.
- **`check_sparse_distribution`:** Ensures that only one point is not on the boundary, verifying the non-boundary point detection logic.

These checks are strategically placed to detect potential performance issues early in the computation process, aiding in the identification of expensive operations during testing or when using fuzzers.
