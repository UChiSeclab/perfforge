system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

The Cybermen and the Daleks have long been the Doctor's main enemies. Everyone knows that both these species enjoy destroying everything they encounter. However, a little-known fact about them is that they both also love taking Turing tests!

Heidi designed a series of increasingly difficult tasks for them to spend their time on, which would allow the Doctor enough time to save innocent lives!

The funny part is that these tasks would be very easy for a human to solve.

The first task is as follows. There are some points on the plane. All but one of them are on the boundary of an axis-aligned square (its sides are parallel to the axes). Identify that point.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10).

Each of the following 4n + 1 lines contains two integers x_i, y_i (0 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 50), describing the coordinates of the next point.

It is guaranteed that there are at least n points on each side of the square and all 4n + 1 points are distinct.

Output

Print two integers — the coordinates of the point that is not on the boundary of the square.

assistant: To analyze the C program and identify performance issues, let's follow the two-phase approach:

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Comparison of Hit Counts:** 
   - The slow input has significantly higher hit counts in the nested loops starting from line 12 to line 17 compared to the fast input. Specifically, the innermost loop on line 17 has an especially high hit count (`slow_hit_count: 29090544` vs. `fast_hit_count: 186086`).
   
2. **Lines/Functions with More Hits:**
   - Lines 12-15 are setting up a sequence of nested loops. The hit counts show that line 15 (`for (int y98911 = y12098; y98911 <= 50; y98911++)`) is executed over 718,000 times for the slow input and only 4,993 times for the fast input. This indicates significant performance degradation.
   - The loop on line 17 (`for (int k = 1; k <= 4 * n + 1; k++)`) is repeatedly executed for each combination of `(x20390, y12098, x21981, y98911)`, contributing to the high hit count on this line.

3. **Interactions with Data Structures:**
   - The nested loops are essentially brute-force searching for a configuration of points forming a square boundary such that all but one point lies on the boundary. Each iteration of the innermost loop checks all points to see if they define the boundary.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the analysis and constraints (e.g., n ≤ 10, coordinates between 0 and 50), we can derive the following performance-characterizing invariants:

1. **Excessive Nested Loop Iterations:** 
   - **Invariant:** "If the points create scenarios where the search space for potential square boundaries is exhaustively large, especially when there are many possible configurations of `(x, y)` pairs between the minimum and maximum coordinates, the program may slow down significantly."
   - **Explanation:** The program uses nested loops to systematically explore all possible rectangle boundaries, and this becomes highly inefficient as the number of possible boundaries grows considerably with increased point variability.

2. **Repeated Boundary Checks:**
   - **Invariant:** "When there is a high degree of variability in point positions leading to many potential boundaries, the program performs repeated boundary checks, which can degrade performance."
   - **Explanation:** Each point is checked multiple times against different boundary conditions within the nested loops, which leads to repetitive calculations and potential performance bottlenecks.

3. **Sparse Distribution of Points:**
   - **Invariant:** "Situations where points are sparsely distributed across the maximum coordinate range can cause the program to perform unnecessary checks for every possible boundary configuration, slowing down the detection of the non-boundary point."
   - **Explanation:** The program's logic inherently checks every possible square defined by two corner points, and when points are spread out, this results in checking many non-promising configurations.

These invariants provide insights into how the program's performance can degrade under specific conditions related to input patterns, such as the distribution and variability of points. By addressing these inefficiencies, future performance slowdowns can be mitigated.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
The Cybermen and the Daleks have long been the Doctor's main enemies. Everyone knows that both these species enjoy destroying everything they encounter. However, a little-known fact about them is that they both also love taking Turing tests!

Heidi designed a series of increasingly difficult tasks for them to spend their time on, which would allow the Doctor enough time to save innocent lives!

The funny part is that these tasks would be very easy for a human to solve.

The first task is as follows. There are some points on the plane. All but one of them are on the boundary of an axis-aligned square (its sides are parallel to the axes). Identify that point.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10).

Each of the following 4n + 1 lines contains two integers x_i, y_i (0 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 50), describing the coordinates of the next point.

It is guaranteed that there are at least n points on each side of the square and all 4n + 1 points are distinct.

Output

Print two integers — the coordinates of the point that is not on the boundary of the square.

Examples

Input


2
0 0
0 1
0 2
1 0
1 1
1 2
2 0

0 0
0 1
0 2
0 3
1 0

Note

In both examples, the square has four sides x=0, x=2, y=0, y=2.

assistant: ### Phase 3: Implement the Natural Language Invariants in C++

Let's translate the performance-characterizing invariants from Phase 2 into runtime checks using C++.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstdio>
using namespace std;

// Function to check excessive nested loop iterations
void check_excessive_iterations(int x20390, int y12098, int x21981, int y98911) {
    if ((x21981 - x20390) > 25 || (y98911 - y12098) > 25) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive nested loop iterations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Function to check repeated boundary checks condition
void check_repeated_boundary_checks(int s1, int s2, int s3, int s4, int n) {
    if (s1 < n || s2 < n || s3 < n || s4 < n) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - repeated boundary checks!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Function to check sparse distribution of points
void check_sparse_distribution(int cnt, int n) {
    if (cnt > 1) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - sparse distribution of points!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrate the Checker Code into the Original Program

Now, insert the checker functions into the provided C++ code, ensuring they are placed after input reading and before entering heavy loops.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstdio>
using namespace std;

int n;
int xx[105], yy[105];
int cnt, po;
int s1, s2, s3, s4;

void check_excessive_iterations(int x20390, int y12098, int x21981, int y98911) {
    if ((x21981 - x20390) > 25 || (y98911 - y12098) > 25) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive nested loop iterations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_repeated_boundary_checks(int s1, int s2, int s3, int s4, int n) {
    if (s1 < n || s2 < n || s3 < n || s4 < n) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - repeated boundary checks!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_sparse_distribution(int cnt, int n) {
    if (cnt > 1) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - sparse distribution of points!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    scanf("%d", &n);
    for (int i = 1; i <= 4 * n + 1; i++) {
        scanf("%d%d", &xx[i], &yy[i]);
    }
    
    for (int x20390 = 0; x20390 <= 50; x20390++) {
        for (int y12098 = 0; y12098 <= 50; y12098++) {
            for (int x21981 = x20390; x21981 <= 50; x21981++) {
                for (int y98911 = y12098; y98911 <= 50; y98911++) {
                    check_excessive_iterations(x20390, y12098, x21981, y98911);
                    
                    s1 = s2 = s3 = s4 = cnt = po = 0;
                    for (int k = 1; k <= 4 * n + 1; k++) {
                        int x = xx[k], y = yy[k];
                        int f = 0;
                        if (x == x20390 && y >= y12098 && y <= y98911) {
                            s1++;
                            f = 1;
                        }
                        if (x == x21981 && y >= y12098 && y <= y98911) {
                            s2++;
                            f = 1;
                        }
                        if (y == y12098 && x >= x20390 && x <= x21981) {
                            s3++;
                            f = 1;
                        }
                        if (y == y98911 && x >= x20390 && x <= x21981) {
                            s4++;
                            f = 1;
                        }
                        if (!f) cnt++, po = k;
                    }
                    
                    // Check repeated boundary conditions
                    check_repeated_boundary_checks(s1, s2, s3, s4, n);
                    
                    // Check if exactly one point isn't on the boundary
                    check_sparse_distribution(cnt, n);
                    
                    if (s1 >= n && s2 >= n && s3 >= n && s4 >= n && cnt == 1) {
                        printf("%d %d\n", xx[po], yy[po]);
                        return 0;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation
- **`check_excessive_iterations`:** Ensures that the area of the rectangle being considered doesn't grow excessively large, indicating too many configurations being checked.
- **`check_repeated_boundary_checks`:** Validates that there are enough points on each side of the square boundary.
- **`check_sparse_distribution`:** Ensures that only one point is not on the boundary, verifying the non-boundary point detection logic.

These checks are strategically placed to detect potential performance issues early in the computation process, aiding in the identification of expensive operations during testing or when using fuzzers.
