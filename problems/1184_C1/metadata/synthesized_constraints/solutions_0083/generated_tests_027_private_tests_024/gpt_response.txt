## Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

### Code Analysis:
1. **chk Function:** 
   - The function `chk(pt a, pt b, pt c)` is called excessively, with `slow_hit_count` of 4,696,140 compared to `fast_hit_count` of 14,060. This indicates that the function is a significant contributor to the slow execution.
   - The function checks if a point `c` lies on the line segment between points `a` and `b`, which is part of checking if a point is on the boundary of a square.

2. **Nested Loops:**
   - The nested loops in the main function iterate over all possible starting points `(i, j)` and sizes `sz` of the square, leading to a high number of executions of the `solve` functionâ€”`slow_hit_count` of 28,635 versus `fast_hit_count` of 95. 
   - Each call to `solve` involves multiple checks for each point on whether it is on the square's boundary, leading to repeated and costly operations.

3. **Loop within `solve`:**
   - The loop `for (pt i : p)` in the `solve` function iterates over all points, and for each point, it calls the `chk` function multiple times (`chk` is called four times per point), aggregating to significant operations especially when `n` is large.

## Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

### Natural Language Performance Invariants

1. **Excessive Boundary Checks:**
   - "If the problem involves a high number of boundary checks due to an exhaustive search over starting points and sizes, performance may degrade. This situation is particularly evident when the number of potential square configurations (size and position) is large."

2. **Repetitive Checks on Points:**
   - "When each point is checked multiple times (e.g., four times per square configuration) to verify its boundary status, especially when the total number of points is near maximum and numerous square configurations are possible, this can lead to slow execution."

3. **High Volume of Nested Iterations:**
   - "The presence of deeply nested loops that explore a large search space can lead to performance issues. In this case, the loops iterate over all possible grid points [0, 50] and sizes [1, 50], leading to a significant number of iterations."

4. **Redundant Checks Across Similar Configurations:**
   - "If the algorithm checks many similar configurations repeatedly without pruning impossible ones early, such as checking every square size and position, this can result in a bottleneck as computation costs accumulate."

### Conclusion
The primary performance bottlenecks occur due to excessive calls to the `chk` function within a nested loop structure that explores every possible square configuration. Conditions where `n` is large and there are many points near the boundaries of potential squares can exacerbate these inefficiencies. Reducing unnecessary checks or optimizing the search space could alleviate these performance issues.

### Phase 3: Implementing Performance-Characterizing Invariants in C++

Below are the C++ implementations of the performance-characterizing invariants derived earlier.

```cpp
// Check for excessive boundary checks
void check_excessive_boundary_checks(int i, int j, int sz) {
    if ((i > 40 || j > 40) && sz > 40) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive boundary checks!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Check for repetitive checks on points
void check_repetitive_checks(int cnt1, int cnt2) {
    if (cnt1 + cnt2 > 4) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - repetitive checks on points!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Check high volume of nested iterations
void check_nested_iterations(int totalIterations) {
    if (totalIterations > 3000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high volume of nested iterations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Check for redundant checks across similar configurations
void check_redundant_checks(int sz) {
    if (sz > 40) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - redundant checks across similar configurations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrating Checkers into the Original Program

Below is the original program with the newly implemented checks integrated at appropriate points in the code.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
using ll = long long;
using ull = unsigned long long;
using ld = long double;
using pii = pair<int, int>;
using pll = pair<ll, ll>;
const int mod = 1e9 + 7;

struct pt {
  int x, y;
};
pt ans = {-1, -1};

bool chk(pt a, pt b, pt c) {
    if (a.x == b.x)
        return c.x == a.x && c.y >= min(a.y, b.y) && c.y <= max(a.y, b.y);
    return c.y == a.y && c.x >= min(a.x, b.x) && c.x <= max(a.x, b.x);
}

void solve(int x, int y, int sz, vector<pt>& p) {
    pt a = {x, y}, b = {x + sz, y}, c = {x + sz, y + sz}, d = {x, y + sz};
    int cnt1 = 0, cnt2 = 0;
    pt t;
    for (pt i : p) {
        int cnt = chk(a, b, i) + chk(b, c, i) + chk(c, d, i) + chk(d, a, i);
        if (cnt)
            cnt1++;
        else {
            cnt2++;
            t = i;
        }
    }
    // Check for repetitive checks on points
    check_repetitive_checks(cnt1, cnt2);

    if (cnt2 == 1) ans = t;
}

int main() {
    ios::sync_with_stdio(0);
    cin.tie(0);
    cout.tie(0);

    int n;
    cin >> n;
    vector<pt> a(4 * n + 1);
    for (pt& i : a) cin >> i.x >> i.y;

    int totalIterations = 0; // Initialize iteration counter

    for (int i = 0; i <= 50; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j <= 50; j++) {
            for (int sz = 1; sz <= 50; sz++) {
                totalIterations++;

                // Check for excessive boundary checks
                check_excessive_boundary_checks(i, j, sz);

                solve(i, j, sz, a);

                // Check redundant checks across similar configurations
                check_redundant_checks(sz);

                if (ans.x != -1) {
                    cout << ans.x << " " << ans.y << endl;
                    return 0;
                }
            }
        }
    }

    // Check high volume of nested iterations
    check_nested_iterations(totalIterations);

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of Integrated Checks

1. **Excessive Boundary Checks:** Added `check_excessive_boundary_checks(i, j, sz)` to monitor potential excessive operations when both the starting points and size are large.
2. **Repetitive Checks on Points:** Added `check_repetitive_checks(cnt1, cnt2)` to detect when a high number of checks are being made on points, possibly indicating inefficiency.
3. **High Volume of Nested Iterations:** Added `check_nested_iterations(totalIterations)` to capture overall high iteration volume across all loops.
4. **Redundant Checks Across Similar Configurations:** Added `check_redundant_checks(sz)` to flag scenarios when size configurations exceed typical limits, indicating potential unnecessary computations. 

These checks help identify and abort potential performance bottlenecks based on the previously derived invariants.
