system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

Vasya has a string s of length n consisting only of digits 0 and 1. Also he has an array a of length n. 

Vasya performs the following operation until the string becomes empty: choose some consecutive substring of equal characters, erase it from the string and glue together the remaining parts (any of them can be empty). For example, if he erases substring 111 from string 111110 he will get the string 110. Vasya gets a_x points for erasing substring of length x.

Vasya wants to maximize his total points, so help him with this! 

Input

The first line contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the length of string s.

The second line contains string s, consisting only of digits 0 and 1.

The third line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ... a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), where a_i is the number of points for erasing the substring of length i.

Output

Print one integer — the maximum total points Vasya can get.

Note

assistant: ### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

By comparing the line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs, we observe:

1. **Function Calls to `solve(ll l, ll r)` and `solve_cnt(ll c, ll l, ll r, ll cnt)`**:
   - `solve` is called 98,440 times in the slow run versus 150 times in the fast run.
   - `solve_cnt` is called 103,399 times in the slow run versus 184 times in the fast run.

2. **Line 25 (`for (ll i = l; i < r; i++)`)**:
   - This loop is executed 199,640 times in the slow run but only 315 times in the fast run. This suggests a possible nested iteration or recursion issue that grows with input size or complexity.

3. **Line 26 (`if (c == s[i] - '0')`)**:
   - This condition is checked 185,225 times in the slow run compared to 225 times in the fast run. There is a frequent branching, implying that the condition is often true.

4. **Recursion and Dynamic Programming (`dp` and `ans` arrays)**:
   - High hit counts on lines related to dynamic programming table checks (`ans[l][r]` and `dp[c][l][r][cnt]`) suggest that storing and retrieving computed results is frequent, but might not be effectively pruning recomputation due to input characteristics.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on these observations, the following natural language performance invariants describe conditions under which the program performance degrades:

1. **Frequent Recursive and DP Calls due to Input Structure**:
   - "If the string contains many small blocks of consecutive identical characters, the recursive function calls increase significantly, leading to slower performance due to overlapping subproblems being recalculated."

2. **High Branching Factor in Recursive Calls**:
   - "When the number of possible substrings to consider increases, especially with varied character patterns, the recursion depth and branching factor grow, causing the algorithm to explore too many potential solutions."

3. **Inefficient DP Cache Utilization**:
   - "If the dynamic programming cache misses frequently due to varied substring lengths being calculated repeatedly, it results in excessive recomputation."

4. **Input Size Impact with Specific Patterns**:
   - "When the length of the string is close to the upper limit (n = 100) and contains a complex interleaving of 0s and 1s, the number of explored states grows, leading to performance bottlenecks."

These invariants suggest that the performance is sensitive not just to the input size, but more critically to the structural complexity and distribution of character sequences within the input string.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
Vasya has a string s of length n consisting only of digits 0 and 1. Also he has an array a of length n. 

Vasya performs the following operation until the string becomes empty: choose some consecutive substring of equal characters, erase it from the string and glue together the remaining parts (any of them can be empty). For example, if he erases substring 111 from string 111110 he will get the string 110. Vasya gets a_x points for erasing substring of length x.

Vasya wants to maximize his total points, so help him with this! 

Input

The first line contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the length of string s.

The second line contains string s, consisting only of digits 0 and 1.

The third line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ... a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), where a_i is the number of points for erasing the substring of length i.

Output

Print one integer — the maximum total points Vasya can get.

Examples

Output


109


Input


5
10101
3 10 15 15 15

Note

In the first example the optimal sequence of erasings is: 1101001 → 111001 → 11101 → 1111 → ∅.

In the second example the optimal sequence of erasings is: 10101 → 1001 → 11 → ∅.

Solution (C++ code):
{solution}


assistant: ### Phase 3: Implement Checker Code in C++

For the natural language invariants derived, we will implement C++ code snippets that check these conditions at runtime.

```cpp
void check_recursive_calls(long long solveCalls, long long solveCntCalls) {
    // Detects frequent recursive calls due to many small blocks.
    if (solveCalls > 10000 || solveCntCalls > 10000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive recursive calls!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_branching_factor(long long branchingOperations) {
    // Detects high branching factor in recursive calls.
    if (branchingOperations > 50000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Branching factor condition triggered - too many operations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_structure_complexity(int n, const std::string& s) {
    // Detects complex interleaving of 0s and 1s.
    int transitions = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
        if (s[i] != s[i - 1]) {
            transitions++;
        }
    }
    if (transitions > n / 2) { // Arbitrary threshold considering half the length as complex.
        cerr << "Warning: Input structure condition triggered - complex interleaving detected!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrate Checker Code into the Original Program

Next, we will integrate these checks into the provided C++ code at appropriate locations.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
using ll = long long;
constexpr ll INF = 1ll << 50, N = 101;
ll dp[2][N][N][N], ans[N][N];
ll n;
string s;
ll a[N];
ll solve_cnt(ll, ll, ll, ll);
ll solveCalls = 0, solveCntCalls = 0; // Counters for recursive calls

void check_recursive_calls(long long solveCalls, long long solveCntCalls) {
    if (solveCalls > 10000 || solveCntCalls > 10000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive recursive calls!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_branching_factor(long long branchingOperations) {
    if (branchingOperations > 50000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Branching factor condition triggered - too many operations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

### Explanation of Integration

- **`check_structure_complexity`** is called after reading the input to detect complex patterns early.
- **`check_recursive_calls`** and **`check_branching_factor`** are called after the recursive computations to ensure these invariants are checked after potential performance bottlenecks are triggered but before the final result is output.
- Counters `solveCalls` and `solveCntCalls` track the number of recursive calls and are checked against thresholds to detect excessive recursive operations.
