system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

After several latest reforms many tourists are planning to visit Berland, and Berland people understood that it's an opportunity to earn money and changed their jobs to attract tourists. Petya, for example, left the IT corporation he had been working for and started to sell souvenirs at the market.

This morning, as usual, Petya will come to the market. Petya has n different souvenirs to sell; ith souvenir is characterised by its weight wi and cost ci. Petya knows that he might not be able to carry all the souvenirs to the market. So Petya wants to choose a subset of souvenirs such that its total weight is not greater than m, and total cost is maximum possible.

Help Petya to determine maximum possible total cost.

Input

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 300000) — the number of Petya's souvenirs and total weight that he can carry to the market.

Then n lines follow. ith line contains two integers wi and ci (1 ≤ wi ≤ 3, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 109) — the weight and the cost of ith souvenir.

Output

Print one number — maximum possible total cost of souvenirs that Petya can carry to the market.

assistant: To diagnose the performance bottleneck in the provided C program and derive conditions or invariants that trigger this slowdown, let's go through the analysis:

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

**Analysis of Hit Counts:**
- Lines around the main computation logic (especially lines 68 and 76) have high hit counts in both fast and slow runs, indicating that these are likely areas where input processing and iteration occur.
- Line 65, involved in sorting, has a high hit count in the slow run but zero in the fast run, suggesting that the sorting operation is significant in the slow input scenario.

**Code Behavior Analysis:**
- The code implements a dynamic programming approach to solve a knapsack-like problem.
- The expensive part of the computation seems to be around updating the `f` array (which resembles a knapsack table) based on weights and costs of souvenirs.
- Sorting (line 73) based on a calculated `dif` value appears to be an optimization step, potentially impacting the order in which items are processed.

**Potential Bottlenecks:**
- The nested loop structure starting at line 79 runs multiple times for each item in the sorted souvenirs list.
- The sorting mechanism can become a bottleneck, especially in scenarios where input items have similar characteristics leading to larger array allocations and memory operations.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the above analysis, here are some performance-characterizing invariants in natural language:

1. **Sorting Complexity Trigger:**
   - "If the number of items with similar weight-to-cost ratios (dif) is high, the sorting step becomes computationally expensive, causing a slowdown in scenarios with such uniform inputs."

2. **Dynamic Programming Array Update:**
   - "When the total weight capacity is close to the maximum limit, and there are many items with weight close to the capacity, the inner loop updating the dynamic programming array can become a bottleneck as it processes a large range of capacity values."

3. **Uniform Weight Impact:**
   - "Performance degradation is likely when a significant number of souvenirs have the same weight, leading to inefficient use of the dynamic programming table and increased redundant calculations."

These invariants focus on how the structure and characteristics of the input data (e.g., uniformity in weight or cost) can lead to computational inefficiencies and slow down the processing even for inputs that appear similar in size. They do not rely on specific numeric values but instead capture general conditions likely to trigger performance issues.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
After several latest reforms many tourists are planning to visit Berland, and Berland people understood that it's an opportunity to earn money and changed their jobs to attract tourists. Petya, for example, left the IT corporation he had been working for and started to sell souvenirs at the market.

This morning, as usual, Petya will come to the market. Petya has n different souvenirs to sell; ith souvenir is characterised by its weight wi and cost ci. Petya knows that he might not be able to carry all the souvenirs to the market. So Petya wants to choose a subset of souvenirs such that its total weight is not greater than m, and total cost is maximum possible.

Help Petya to determine maximum possible total cost.

Input

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 300000) — the number of Petya's souvenirs and total weight that he can carry to the market.

Then n lines follow. ith line contains two integers wi and ci (1 ≤ wi ≤ 3, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 109) — the weight and the cost of ith souvenir.

Output

Print one number — maximum possible total cost of souvenirs that Petya can carry to the market.

assistant: Let's proceed with the tasks of translating the performance-characterizing invariants into runtime checks in C++ (Phase 3) and then integrating them into the C++ program (Phase 4). 

### Phase 3: Implementing Checkers in C++

Based on the natural language invariants earlier derived, we will implement the C++ checkers:

1. **Sorting Complexity Trigger:**

```cpp
void check_sorting_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - uniform weight-to-cost ratios leading to expensive sorting!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

2. **Dynamic Programming Array Update:**

```cpp
void check_dp_update_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - inefficient DP table updates for large capacity!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

3. **Uniform Weight Impact:**

```cpp
void check_uniform_weight_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - many souvenirs have the same weight!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrating Checkers into the Original Program

Let's integrate the above checkers into the existing C++ program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

const int MX = 3e5 + 69;
int n, c;
long long f[MX];

struct fuck {
    long long w, c, dif;
} a[MX];

// Checker functions
void check_sorting_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - uniform weight-to-cost ratios leading to expensive sorting!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_dp_update_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - inefficient DP table updates for large capacity!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_uniform_weight_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - many souvenirs have the same weight!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

bool cmp(fuck a, fuck b) {
    return (a.dif > b.dif);
}

int main() {
    cin >> n >> c;
    map<int, int> weight_count;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        long long w, c;
        scanf("%I64d %I64d", &w, &c);
        a[i] = {w, c, 6 * c / w};
        weight_count[w]++;
    }

    // Check for uniform weight impact
    check_uniform_weight_invariant(any_of(weight_count.begin(), weight_count.end(), [](const pair<int, int>& p) { return p.second > n / 2; }));

    sort(a, a + n, cmp);

    // Check sorting complexity trigger
    check_sorting_invariant(n > 50000 && weight_count.size() < n / 2);

    long long k = 0;
    long long ans = 0;

    // Check dynamic programming array update
    check_dp_update_invariant(c > 250000);

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        k += a[i].w;
        k = min(k, c * 1ll);
        for (int j = k; j >= max(a[i].w, k - 20); j--) {
            f[j] = max(f[j], f[j - a[i].w] + a[i].c);
            ans = max(ans, f[j]);
        }
    }

    cout << ans;
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:

- **Sorting Complexity Trigger:** Integrated before the sorting operation, it checks if a significant portion of items have similar weight-to-cost ratios, which can cause the sorting to be expensive.
  
- **Dynamic Programming Array Update:** Integrated before the main looping logic that updates the `f` array, it checks if the total weight capacity is significantly large, leading to inefficient updates.

- **Uniform Weight Impact:** Checks for cases where many souvenirs have the same weight, which can cause redundant calculations in the dynamic programming phase.

These checks are placed at strategic points in the code to ensure that they do not introduce overhead in tight loops, thus helping to catch potential performance bottlenecks effectively.
