system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

After several latest reforms many tourists are planning to visit Berland, and Berland people understood that it's an opportunity to earn money and changed their jobs to attract tourists. Petya, for example, left the IT corporation he had been working for and started to sell souvenirs at the market.

This morning, as usual, Petya will come to the market. Petya has n different souvenirs to sell; ith souvenir is characterised by its weight wi and cost ci. Petya knows that he might not be able to carry all the souvenirs to the market. So Petya wants to choose a subset of souvenirs such that its total weight is not greater than m, and total cost is maximum possible.

Help Petya to determine maximum possible total cost.

Input

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 300000) — the number of Petya's souvenirs and total weight that he can carry to the market.

Then n lines follow. ith line contains two integers wi and ci (1 ≤ wi ≤ 3, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 109) — the weight and the cost of ith souvenir.

Output

Print one number — maximum possible total cost of souvenirs that Petya can carry to the market.

assistant: To diagnose and address performance issues in the given C program, let's break down and analyze the slow and fast input cases, along with their respective hit counts. We'll identify expensive computations and derive performance-characterizing invariants.

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Line-Level Hit Count Analysis**:
   - The key difference between slow and fast runs is in the binary search loop (lines 42-50).
   - The loop on line 42, which appears to be performing a binary search, is hit significantly more times in the slow input (900,002 times) compared to the fast input (599,998 times).
   - Lines 43-46, involved in the binary search logic, are also hit more often in the slow input, indicating a performance bottleneck in this section.
   - The initial setup calculations (lines 28-38) show no difference and aren't the primary concern here.
   - The main issue lies in how many iterations the binary search requires, which is influenced by cnt[2] and how it interacts with input constraints.

2. **Data Interaction**:
   - The slowdown is likely a result of how the `cnt` array, especially `cnt[2]`, influences the binary search range (lines 41-50).
   - Given the maximum constraints (`n <= 100000` and `m <= 300000`), more iterations of the binary search loop seem to be triggered by specific combinations of weights and counts.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the analysis, here are natural language performance invariants that describe under what conditions the program slows down:

1. **Invariant 1**: "When there are many souvenirs with weight 2, the program may enter a slow path. If the count of weight 2 souvenirs is high relative to the total number of items, the binary search in the dynamic programming phase becomes computationally expensive."

2. **Invariant 2**: "If the combination of available weights pushes the iteration limits of the inner calculations, such as when `cnt[2]` approaches half of the capacity limit `m`, the binary search loop can iterate excessively, causing slow execution."

3. **Invariant 3**: "When `n` is large and many items fall into the middle weight category (weight 2), the overhead from repeatedly calculating possible subsets and recalibrating maximum costs grows, leading to performance degradation."

### Implementation Suggestions

To help a fuzzer or static analyzer catch these scenarios, consider adding checks before entering the binary search:

```cpp
void check_binary_search_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: binary search invariant triggered - excessive iterations due to high count of weight 2 items" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Place this check before the binary search loop
check_binary_search_invariant(cnt[2] > n / 4); // Example threshold
```

These invariants highlight when the program is likely to experience performance issues, especially focusing on the distribution and volume of items with weight 2, and how they affect the binary search operations.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

So Petya wants to choose a subset of souvenirs such that its total weight is not greater than m, and total cost is maximum possible.

Help Petya to determine maximum possible total cost.

Input

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 300000) — the number of Petya's souvenirs and total weight that he can carry to the market.

Then n lines follow. ith line contains two integers wi and ci (1 ≤ wi ≤ 3, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 109) — the weight and the cost of ith souvenir.

Output

Print one number — maximum possible total cost of souvenirs that Petya can carry to the market.

assistant: Let's proceed with implementing the performance-characterizing invariants in C++ as runtime checks.

### Phase 3: Implement the Natural Language Invariants in C++

Here are the runtime checks based on the natural language invariants derived earlier:

1. **Invariant related to many souvenirs with weight 2**:
   - **Description**: If there are many souvenirs with weight 2, the program may enter a slow path. If the count of weight 2 souvenirs is high relative to the total number of items, the binary search in the dynamic programming phase becomes computationally expensive.
   
   ```cpp
   void check_weight_2_invariant(int cnt2, int n) {
       if (cnt2 > n / 4) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to high count of weight 2 items!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Invariant related to combinations of weights**:
   - **Description**: If the combination of available weights pushes the iteration limits of the inner calculations, such as when `cnt[2]` approaches half of the capacity limit `m`, the binary search loop can iterate excessively, causing slow execution.
   
   ```cpp
   void check_weight_combination_invariant(int cnt2, int m) {
       if (cnt2 > m / 4) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to weight 2 items approaching half of capacity!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Integrate Checks into the Original Program

Now, let's integrate these checks into the provided C++ code. We'll place the checks after reading inputs and before entering the binary search loop to ensure they don't add overhead in tight loops.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

void read(int &x) {
  char ch = getchar();
  x = 0;
  for (; ch == ' ' || ch == '\n'; ch = getchar())
    ;
  for (; ch != ' ' && ch != '\n'; x = x * 10 + ch - '0', ch = getchar())
    ;
}

void write(long long x) {
  if (x > 9) write(x / 10);
  putchar(x % 10 + '0');
}

void check_weight_2_invariant(int cnt2, int n) {
    if (cnt2 > n / 4) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to high count of weight 2 items!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_weight_combination_invariant(int cnt2, int m) {
    if (cnt2 > m / 4) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to weight 2 items approaching half of capacity!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int cnt[4];
long long dat[4][100004];
bool cmp(int a, int b) { return a > b; }
long long dp[300004], stane[300004];

int main() {
  int n, m;
  read(n), read(m);
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    int w, c;
    read(w), read(c);
    dat[w][++cnt[w]] = c;
  }

  // Insert checks after input reading
  check_weight_2_invariant(cnt[2], n);
  check_weight_combination_invariant(cnt[2], m);

  for (int i = 1; i <= 3; i++) sort(dat[i] + 1, dat[i] + 1 + cnt[i], cmp);
  for (int i = 1; i < 100004; i++)
    for (int j = 1; j <= 3; j++) dat[j][i] = dat[j][i - 1] + dat[j][i];
  for (int i = 1; i < 300004; i++) {
    if (i < 100004)
      stane[i] = dat[1][i];
    else
      stane[i] = dat[1][100003];
  }
  for (int i = 1; i < 300004; i++) {
    if (i <= 1 || stane[i] >= dat[2][1] + stane[i - 2]) {
      dp[i] = stane[i];
      continue;
    }
    int l = 0, r = min(cnt[2], i / 2) + 1;
    while (r > l + 1) {
      int mid = (l + r) / 2;
      if (dat[2][mid] + stane[i - 2 * mid] >
          dat[2][mid - 1] + stane[i - 2 * (mid - 1)])
        l = mid;
      else
        r = mid;
    }
    dp[i] = dat[2][l] + stane[i - 2 * l];
  }
  long long ans = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i * 3 <= m; i++) ans = max(ans, dp[m - i * 3] + dat[3][i]);
  write(ans);
}
```

### Explanation

- **Check Placement**: The checks are placed right after reading all inputs. This ensures we evaluate potential bottlenecks before any computationally expensive operations occur.
- **Warnings and Aborts**: Each check triggers a warning and program abortion if the condition is met, helping detect potential performance issues during testing or fuzzing.
