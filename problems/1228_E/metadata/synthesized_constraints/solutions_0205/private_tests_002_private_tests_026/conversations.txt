system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

You have n × n square grid and an integer k. Put an integer in each cell while satisfying the conditions below.

  * All numbers in the grid should be between 1 and k inclusive.

assistant: ### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

By analyzing the hit count information:

1. **Function `go`**: This function is called 7,812,626 times for the slow input, which is significantly higher than for the fast input (where it's not called at all because `k=1` immediately returns with a result). This suggests that the recursive calls within `go` are a major contributor to the slow performance.
   
2. **Function `nCr`**: This function is invoked 7,750,375 times for the slow input, indicating that the combination calculations inside the loop in the `go` function are frequently executed.

3. **Loop in `go` function**: The loop at line 43 is executed extensively, as highlighted by its significant hit count (7,812,626 times for the slow input). This loop iterates over possible combinations and makes recursive calls, substantially increasing the execution time.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the above analysis, here are the performance-characterizing invariants:

1. **High Branching and Recursion Due to Large `k` Values**:
   - **Natural Language Description**: "If `k` is large, the recursion depth and number of recursive branches in the `go` function increase significantly, leading to exponential growth in computation time."
   - **Rationale**: The significant increase in the hit counts for the recursive function `go` shows that larger values of `k` cause the function to evaluate many combinations, leading to performance degradation.

2. **Combination Generation with Large `n`**:
   - **Natural Language Description**: "When `n` is near its upper limit, the number of combinations calculated by `nCr` grows substantially, increasing computational overhead."
   - **Rationale**: The high hit count for the `nCr` function indicates that for large `n`, calculating combinations consumes a significant amount of processing power, especially when paired with large `k`.

3. **Exponential Growth in Recursive Call Tree**:
   - **Natural Language Description**: "The combination of large `n` and `k` values results in an exponentially-growing recursive call tree in the `go` function, as it explores all possible grid configurations."
   - **Rationale**: The recursive pattern and high hit counts suggest that the function explores an exponentially large solution space as `n` and `k` increase, making the process computationally expensive.

These invariants capture the main conditions under which the program experiences slow performance, focusing on the recursive and combinatorial nature of the solution. The emphasis is on the interaction between large values of `n` and `k` leading to increased depth and breadth of recursion, highlighting the exponential growth in computational complexity.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function

Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
You have n × n square grid and an integer k. Put an integer in each cell while satisfying the conditions below.

  * All numbers in the grid should be between 1 and k inclusive. 
  * Minimum number of the i-th row is 1 (1 ≤ i ≤ n). 
  * Minimum number of the j-th column is 1 (1 ≤ j ≤ n). 



Find the number of ways to put integers in the grid. Since the answer can be very large, find the answer modulo (10^{9} + 7).

assistant: ### Phase 3: Implementing Invariants as Checker Code in C++

Below are the C++ code snippets implementing the performance-characterizing invariants derived in the previous phase. These checks are designed to detect potential bottlenecks in the algorithm based on the conditions described.

1. **High Branching and Recursion Due to Large `k` Values**:

   ```cpp
   void check_recursion_invariant(long long k) {
       if (k > 100000) { // Arbitrary threshold for large k
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high branching and recursion due to large k!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Combination Generation with Large `n`**:

   ```cpp
   void check_combination_invariant(int n) {
       if (n > 200) { // Threshold for large n close to the upper limit
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive combination calculations for large n!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Exponential Growth in Recursive Call Tree**:

   ```cpp
   void check_recursive_growth_invariant(int n, long long k) {
       if (n > 200 && k > 100000) { // Combined effect of large n and k
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - exponential growth in recursive call tree!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Integrating Checker Code into the Original C++ Program

I will now incorporate the checker functions into the provided C++ program. The checks will be placed at strategic points to monitor for potential performance issues without introducing overhead in tight loops.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
const long long MOD = 1000000007;

void check_recursion_invariant(long long k) {
    if (k > 100000) { // Arbitrary threshold for large k
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high branching and recursion due to large k!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_combination_invariant(int n) {
    if (n > 200) { // Threshold for large n close to the upper limit
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive combination calculations for large n!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_recursive_growth_invariant(int n, long long k) {
    if (n > 200 && k > 100000) { // Combined effect of large n and k
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - exponential growth in recursive call tree!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

long long POW(long long a, long long b, long long MMM = MOD) {
    long long ret = 1;
    for (; b; b >>= 1, a = (a * a) % MMM)
        if (b & 1) ret = (ret * a) % MMM;
    return ret;
}

long long gcd(long long a, long long b) { return b ? gcd(b, a % b) : a; }

long long lcm(long long a, long long b) {
    if (a == 0 || b == 0) return a + b;
    return a * (b / gcd(a, b));
}

int dx[] = {0, 1, 0, -1, 1, 1, -1, -1}, dy[] = {1, 0, -1, 0, 1, -1, 1, -1};
int ddx[] = {2, 2, -2, -2, 1, 1, -1, -1}, ddy[] = {1, -1, 1, -1, 2, -2, 2, -2};

long long fac[301];
long long inv[301];
long long powk[301], powk1[301];

int n;
long long k;

long long nCr(int n, int r) {
    if (r > n) return 0;
    long long c = fac[n];
    c = (c * inv[r]) % MOD;
    c = (c * inv[n - r]) % MOD;
    return c;
}

long long d[255][255];

long long go(int N, int c) {
    if (N == n) {
        return c == n;
    }
    long long &ret = d[N][c];
    if (~ret) return ret;
    ret = 0;
    if (c > 0) {
        long long cc = powk[c] - powk1[c];
        if (cc < 0) cc += MOD;
        cc = (cc * powk1[n - c]) % MOD;
        ret = (ret + cc * go(N + 1, c)) % MOD;
    }
    for (int i = 1; i <= (n - c); i++) {
        long long cc = nCr(n - c, i);
        cc = (cc * powk1[n - c - i]) % MOD;
        cc = (cc * powk[c]) % MOD;
        ret = (ret + cc * go(N + 1, c + i)) % MOD;
    }
    return ret;
}

int main() {
    memset((d), -1, sizeof(d));
    fac[0] = inv[0] = 1;
    for (int i = 1; i <= 300; i++) fac[i] = (fac[i - 1] * i) % MOD;
    inv[300] = POW(fac[300], MOD - 2);
    for (int i = 299; i >= 1; i--)
        inv[i] = (inv[i + 1] * (i + 1)) % MOD;
    scanf("%d%lld", &n, &k);

    // Place checkers after reading inputs
    check_recursion_invariant(k);
    check_combination_invariant(n);
    check_recursive_growth_invariant(n, k);

    powk[0] = powk1[0] = 1;
    for (int i = 1; i <= 300; i++) {
        powk[i] = (powk[i - 1] * k) % MOD;
        powk1[i] = (powk1[i - 1] * (k - 1)) % MOD;
    }
    if (n == 1 || k == 1) return !printf("1");
    printf("%lld", go(0, 0));
}
```

### Explanation of Integration
- **Checker functions** were placed directly after the input is read (`scanf`), which ensures that the checks are done before any heavy computation starts, minimizing the overhead.
- The thresholds in the checker functions are set to capture scenarios where the code will likely slow down significantly, without relying on exact values from slow inputs, thus generalizing the performance characteristics.
