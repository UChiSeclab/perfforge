system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

You have n × n square grid and an integer k. Put an integer in each cell while satisfying the conditions below.

  * All numbers in the grid should be between 1 and k inclusive. 
  * Minimum number of the i-th row is 1 (1 ≤ i ≤ n). 
  * Minimum number of the j-th column is 1 (1 ≤ j ≤ n).

assistant: ### Phase 1: Identifying Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

The provided program shows a significant difference in hit counts between the "slow" and "fast" inputs, indicating the areas of the code responsible for the performance bottlenecks. Let's analyze them:

1. **`bigmod` function (lines 16 to 23):** 
   - **Hit Count:** Lines 18 to 21 are hit 504,536 times for the slow input compared to only 7,781 times for the fast input. This function is an implementation of modular exponentiation, which is crucial for calculating powers efficiently under a modulus.
   - **Impact:** The high hit count for the slow input suggests repeated calculations of powers are being made, particularly for large values of `k`, which leads to a slowdown.

2. **`ncr` function (lines 27 to 31):**
   - **Hit Count:** Lines 28 to 30 are each hit 7,750,375 times for the slow input but not at all for the fast input. This function calculates combinations, which are frequently used in the recursive calls of `f`.
   - **Impact:** The large number of calls to this function suggests that combinatorial calculations significantly contribute to the slowdown.

3. **Recursive function `f` (lines 32 to 55):**
   - **Hit Count:** Lines 33 to 54 show very high hit counts for the slow input, indicating deep recursion and many recursive calls.
   - **Impact:** The recursion handles grid configurations, and its complexity grows rapidly with increasing values of `n` and `k`.

4. **Outer loop within `f` (lines 41 to 47):**
   - **Hit Count:** This loop runs for each recursive call of `f`, where lines 42 to 46 are each executed 7,750,375 times.
   - **Impact:** This combination of recursion depth and loop iterations exacerbates the performance bottleneck.

### Phase 2: Deriving Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on this analysis, we can derive performance invariants, conditions under which the program slows down:

1. **Exponential Growth in Combinatorial Calculations:**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "If both `n` is large, around its upper limit, and `k` is significantly large, close to its upper bound, the program may slow down due to excessive combinatorial calculations."
   - **Rationale:** The recursive calculations combined with large values of `k` increase the complexity of combinatorial computations exponentially.

2. **Recursive Depth and Breadth Issues:**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "When `n` is near 250, and `k` substantially exceeds the average size of elements in recursive branching, the recursion depth and breadth can become too large, leading to significant slowdowns."
   - **Rationale:** The recursive structure of the solution creates a large search tree, further expanded by large `k`, leading to excessive computations.

3. **Repeated Power Calculations:**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "For large `k`, especially near the maximum constraint, the repeated calculations of powers increase computational overhead, slowing down the execution."
   - **Rationale:** The need for frequent power computations, due to large `k`, causes significant computation time.

These performance-characterizing invariants help identify scenarios that would generally trigger slowdowns without relying on exact input values but instead focusing on the growth patterns and algorithmic complexity related to the problem constraints.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
You have n × n square grid and an integer k. Put an integer in each cell while satisfying the conditions below.

  * All numbers in the grid should be between 1 and k inclusive. 
  * Minimum number of the i-th row is 1 (1 ≤ i ≤ n). 
  * Minimum number of the j-th column is 1 (1 ≤ j ≤ n). 



Find the number of ways to put integers in the grid. Since the answer can be very large, find the answer modulo (10^{9} + 7).

assistant: ### Phase 3: Implementing Natural Language Invariants as C++ Runtime Checkers

Given the performance-characterizing invariants derived earlier, we will now implement these as runtime checks in C++.

1. **Exponential Growth in Combinatorial Calculations:**

   ```cpp
   void check_combinatorial_invariant(int n, long long k) {
       if (n > 240 && k > 1e8) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to excessive combinatorial calculations!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Recursive Depth and Breadth Issues:**

   ```cpp
   void check_recursion_invariant(int n, long long k) {
       if (n > 240 && k > 1e8) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to high recursion depth or branching factor!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Repeated Power Calculations:**

   ```cpp
   void check_power_invariant(long long k) {
       if (k > 1e8) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered by repeated power calculations!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Integrating Checkers into the C++ Program

Now, we will integrate these checkers into the original program. We'll strategically place them to detect performance bottlenecks before the main computational paths are executed.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Function to check for combinatorial calculation bottleneck
void check_combinatorial_invariant(int n, long long k) {
    if (n > 240 && k > 1e8) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to excessive combinatorial calculations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Function to check for recursive depth and breadth issues
void check_recursion_invariant(int n, long long k) {
    if (n > 240 && k > 1e8) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to high recursion depth or branching factor!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Function to check for repeated power calculation issues
void check_power_invariant(long long k) {
    if (k > 1e8) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered by repeated power calculations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

inline long long gcd(long long a, long long b) {
    a = ((a) < 0 ? -(a) : (a));
    b = ((b) < 0 ? -(b) : (b));
    while (b) {
        a = a % b;
        swap(a, b);
    }
    return a;
}

const long long inf = 2147383647;
const long long mod = 1000000007;
const double pi = 2 * acos(0.0);
const double eps = 1e-9;

inline long long bigmod(long long a, long long p, long long m) {
    long long res = 1 % m, x = a % m;
    while (p) {
        if (p & 1) res = (res * x) % m;
        x = (x * x) % m;
        p >>= 1;
    }
    return res;
}

int n, k;
long long dp[255][255], fact[255], inv[255], ar[2][255];

long long ncr(int x, int y) {
    long long res = (fact[x] * inv[x - y]) % mod;
    res = (res * inv[y]) % mod;
    return res;
}

long long f(int row, int rem) {
    long long &res = dp[row][rem];
    if (res != -1) return res;
    if (row == n + 1) {
        res = (rem == 0) ? 1 : 0;
        return res;
    }
    res = 0;
    long long tmp;
    for (int i = 1; i <= rem; i++) {
        tmp = ncr(rem, i);
        tmp = (tmp * ar[1][rem - i]) % mod;
        tmp = (tmp * ar[0][n - rem]) % mod;
        tmp = (tmp * f(row + 1, rem - i));
        res = (res + tmp) % mod;
    }
    if (rem < n) {
        tmp = (ar[0][n - rem] - ar[1][n - rem] + mod) % mod;
        tmp = (tmp * bigmod(k - 1, rem, mod)) % mod;
        tmp = (tmp * f(row + 1, rem)) % mod;
        res = (res + tmp) % mod;
    }
    return res;
}

int main() {
    fact[0] = 1;
    for (long long i = 1; i <= 250; ++i) fact[i] = (fact[i - 1] * i) % mod;
    for (long long i = 0; i <= 250; ++i)
        inv[i] = bigmod(fact[i], mod - 2, mod);

    cin >> n >> k;

    // Check for potential performance bottlenecks
    check_combinatorial_invariant(n, k);
    check_recursion_invariant(n, k);
    check_power_invariant(k);

    if (k == 1) {
        cout << 1 << "\n";
        return 0;
    }

    ar[0][0] = 1;
    ar[1][0] = 1;
    for (long long i = 1; i <= 250; ++i) {
        ar[0][i] = (ar[0][i - 1] * k) % mod;
        ar[1][i] = (ar[1][i - 1] * (k - 1)) % mod;
    }

    memset(dp, -1, sizeof(dp));
    cout << f(1, n) << "\n";
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation
- **Checker Functions:** Each checker function evaluates a specific performance bottleneck condition based on the earlier derived invariants.
- **Integration:** Checkers are called after reading the input values for `n` and `k` and before the main computational logic begins. This placement ensures that potential bottlenecks are detected early without affecting the performance of the main computation.
- **abort():** Each checker uses `abort()` to stop execution upon detecting a condition likely to cause a performance bottleneck, making it suitable for detecting problematic input during testing or fuzzing.
