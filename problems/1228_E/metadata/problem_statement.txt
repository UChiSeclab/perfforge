You have n × n square grid and an integer k. Put an integer in each cell while satisfying the conditions below.

  * All numbers in the grid should be between 1 and k inclusive. 
  * Minimum number of the i-th row is 1 (1 ≤ i ≤ n). 
  * Minimum number of the j-th column is 1 (1 ≤ j ≤ n). 



Find the number of ways to put integers in the grid. Since the answer can be very large, find the answer modulo (10^{9} + 7).

<image> These are the examples of valid and invalid grid when n=k=2. 

Input

The only line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 250, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^{9}).

Output

Print the answer modulo (10^{9} + 7).
