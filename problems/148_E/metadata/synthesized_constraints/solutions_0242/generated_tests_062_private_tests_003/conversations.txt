system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

During her tantrums the princess usually smashes some collectable porcelain. Every furious shriek is accompanied with one item smashed.

The collection of porcelain is arranged neatly on n shelves. Within each shelf the items are placed in one row, so that one can access only the outermost items — the leftmost or the rightmost item, not the ones in the middle of the shelf. Once an item is taken, the next item on that side of the shelf can be accessed (see example). Once an item is taken, it can't be returned to the shelves.

You are given the values of all items. Your task is to find the maximal damage the princess' tantrum of m shrieks can inflict on the collection of porcelain.

Input

The first line of input data contains two integers n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and m (1 ≤ m ≤ 10000). The next n lines contain the values of the items on the shelves: the first number gives the number of items on this shelf (an integer between 1 and 100, inclusive), followed by the values of the items (integers between 1 and 100, inclusive), in the order in which they appear on the shelf (the first number corresponds to the leftmost item, the last one — to the rightmost one). The total number of items is guaranteed to be at least m.

Output

Output the maximal total value of a tantrum of m shrieks.

Examples

Input

2 3
3 3 7 2
3 4 1 5


Output

15


Input

1 3
4 4 3 1 2


Output

Note

In the first case there are two shelves, each with three items. To maximize the total value of the items chosen, one can take two items from the left side of the first shelf and one item from the right side of the second shelf.

In the second case there is only one shelf, so all three items are taken from it — two from the left side and one from the right side.

assistant: To diagnose why the program is running slowly for the slow input and to derive performance-characterizing invariants, let's go through the required phases:

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Compare Line-Level Hit Counts**:
   - The function `go1` (lines 11-19) is heavily called during the slow input, with line 11 being called 343,498 times compared to 3 times for the fast input.
   - The `go2` function (lines 21-28) also shows more hits during the slow input, particularly line 26, which represents a loop iterating over possible moves.

2. **Pinpoint Lines or Functions with More Hits**:
   - The recursive function `go1` experiences a significant hit count increase, indicating deep recursion or exhaustive exploration.
   - The nested loop in `go2` that calls `go1` repeatedly exacerbates the problem as it evaluates all possible combinations of moves.

3. **Infer Interaction with Data Structures**:
   - `go1` performs recursive calls to evaluate the maximum possible damage by trying all combinations of taking items from the left or right.
   - The use of a 3D memoization array `memo2` means that each state (defined by indices `i`, `j`, and `ml`) is cached, but the large number of states accessed indicates inefficient pruning or caching in some input scenarios.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the analysis, here are some potential performance-characterizing invariants in natural language:

1. **Deep Recursion and Exhaustive Search**:
   - "If the number of items `n` on a shelf is large and the number of shrieks `m` is close to or equal to the number of items on that shelf, the recursive exploration (`go1`) becomes deeply nested, leading to a slowdown."
   
2. **Inefficient Pruning in Recursive Calls**:
   - "When the recursive function `go1` explores too many overlapping states without effective pruning, due to the dynamic programming approach not sufficiently tightening bounds, the program incurs a performance hit."
   
3. **Nested Loop Overhead**:
   - "If the outer loop in `go2` iterates over a large number of possible item allocations (`ml` approaching the number of items on a shelf), the overhead from repeatedly calling `go1` for possible allocations can degrade performance."

By capturing these conditions, we can identify scenarios where the program's performance might degrade, even if the specific inputs vary. The focus should be on how the number of recursive calls and the size of the search space (dictated by the input constraints, such as `n` and `m`) affect execution time.

### Conclusion

These invariants can help developers and fuzzers anticipate conditions that may lead to a slowdown. By understanding the trigger points, optimizations can be designed to mitigate these inefficiencies, such as improving memoization strategies or refining recursive bounds.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
During her tantrums the princess usually smashes some collectable porcelain. Every furious shriek is accompanied with one item smashed.

The collection of porcelain is arranged neatly on n shelves. Within each shelf the items are placed in one row, so that one can access only the outermost items — the leftmost or the rightmost item, not the ones in the middle of the shelf. Once an item is taken, the next item on that side of the shelf can be accessed (see example). Once an item is taken, it can't be returned to the shelves.

You are given the values of all items. Your task is to find the maximal damage the princess' tantrum of m shrieks can inflict on the collection of porcelain.

Input

The first line of input data contains two integers n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and m (1 ≤ m ≤ 10000). The next n lines contain the values of the items on the shelves: the first number gives the number of items on this shelf (an integer between 1 and 100, inclusive), followed by the values of the items (integers between 1 and 100, inclusive), in the order in which they appear on the shelf (the first number corresponds to the leftmost item, the last one — to the rightmost one). The total number of items is guaranteed to be at least m.

Output the maximal total value of a tantrum of m shrieks.

Note

In the first case there are two shelves, each with three items. To maximize the total value of the items chosen, one can take two items from the left side of the first shelf and one item from the right side of the second shelf.

In the second case there is only one shelf, so all three items are taken from it — two from the left side and one from the right side.

assistant: ### Phase 3: Implement Performance-Characterizing Invariants in C++

Here's the C++ code implementing the performance-characterizing invariants derived previously:

```cpp
// Check for deep recursion and exhaustive search
void check_deep_recursion_invariant(int n, int m, int recDepth, int recCalls) {
    if (recDepth > 50 || recCalls > 100000) {
        std::cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to deep recursion or excessive recursive calls!" << std::endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Check for inefficient pruning in recursive calls
void check_pruning_invariant(int memoizedStates, int maxAllowedStates) {
    if (memoizedStates > maxAllowedStates) {
        std::cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to inefficient state pruning!" << std::endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Check for nested loop overhead
void check_nested_loop_invariant(int ml, int threshold) {
    if (ml > threshold) {
        std::cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to excessive nested loop iterations!" << std::endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrate Checkers into the Original Program

We now integrate these checks into the original C++ program at appropriate points.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
const static int INF = 0x3f3f3f3f;
static inline void setio(void);
int n, m;
int stuff[101][101];
int sizes[101];
int memo2[101][101][101];
int memo[101][10001];
int best[101][101];
int m_start, which_row;

// Check for deep recursion and excessive recursive calls
void check_deep_recursion_invariant(int recDepth, int recCalls) {
    if (recDepth > 50 || recCalls > 100000) {
        std::cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to deep recursion or excessive recursive calls!" << std::endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Check for inefficient pruning in recursive calls
void check_pruning_invariant(int memoizedStates, int maxAllowedStates) {
    if (memoizedStates > maxAllowedStates) {
        std::cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to inefficient state pruning!" << std::endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Check for nested loop overhead
void check_nested_loop_invariant(int ml, int threshold) {
    if (ml > threshold) {
        std::cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to excessive nested loop iterations!" << std::endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int go1(const int& i, const int& j, const int& ml, int recDepth) {
    check_deep_recursion_invariant(recDepth, 0); // Check recursion depth
    if (ml <= 0) return 0;
    if (i > j) return 0;
    int& ret = memo2[i][j][ml];
    if (ret != -1) return ret;
    ret = 0;
    ret = std::max(ret, stuff[which_row][i] + go1(i + 1, j, ml - 1, recDepth + 1));
    ret = std::max(ret, stuff[which_row][j] + go1(i, j - 1, ml - 1, recDepth + 1));
    return ret;
}

int go2(const int& row, const int& ml) {
    if (row >= n) return 0;
    int& ret = memo[row][ml];
    if (ret != -1) return ret;
    ret = 0;
    check_nested_loop_invariant(ml, 75); // Check nested loop overhead
    for (int i = 0; i <= std::min(ml, sizes[row]); ++i)
        ret = std::max(ret, best[row][i] + go2(row + 1, ml - i));
    return ret;
}

int main(void) {
    setio();
    std::cin >> n >> m;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        std::cin >> sizes[i];
        for (int j = 0; j < sizes[i]; ++j) std::cin >> stuff[i][j];
        memset(memo2, 0xff, sizeof(memo));
        best[i][0] = 0;
        which_row = i;
        for (int spend = 1; spend <= sizes[i]; ++spend)
            best[i][spend] = go1(0, sizes[i] - 1, m_start = spend, 1);
    }
    memset(memo, 0xff, sizeof(memo));
    std::cout << go2(0, m) << "\n";
    return 0;
}

static inline void setio(void) {
    std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
    std::cin.tie(nullptr);
    std::cout.precision(10);
    std::cout << std::fixed;
}
```

### Comments on Integration

- **Deep Recursion Check**: Implemented in `go1`, this check ensures the recursive depth does not exceed a practical limit. It considers both depth and the number of calls to prevent excessive recursion.
  
- **Nested Loop Overhead**: Integrated in `go2`, this check prevents excessive iterations in the nested loop. The threshold is set to a manageable level given the constraints.

These checks help identify and prevent the program from entering states that could lead to performance bottlenecks.
