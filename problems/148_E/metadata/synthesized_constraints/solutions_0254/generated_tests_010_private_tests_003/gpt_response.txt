=== Invariants Response ===
To identify the performance bottlenecks in the provided C code, we analyze the hit counts for each line and compare them between the slow and fast inputs. The goal is to extract conditions or invariants that characterize when and why the program runs slowly.

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Function `funa`:** 
   - The hit counts for `funa` are significantly higher for the slow input (343,501 hits) compared to the fast input (4 hits). This indicates that `funa` is a critical area where performance degrades.
   - Lines 11 and 12, which perform recursive calls to `funa`, are hit 171,700 times each in the slow input. This recursive behavior suggests that the function may be exploring a large search space, leading to a slowdown.

2. **Function `funb`:**
   - Although `funb` is called less frequently than `funa`, it also shows higher hit counts in the slow input, especially line 22, which recursively calls `funb`.
   - This indicates that `funb`, combined with `funa`, contributes to the slowdown due to its nested recursion and dynamic programming approach.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the analysis, we identify several conditions that can trigger slow performance:

1. **Recursive Exploration in `funa`:**
   - **Invariant:** "When the shelves have a large number of items, especially close to the constraint limit (e.g., 100 items per shelf), the recursive exploration in `funa` can become expensive if it explores many combinations of items to maximize the damage."

2. **Depth and Breadth of Recursive Calls:**
   - **Invariant:** "If the recursion depth in `funa` is high due to a large number of remaining items to choose (`rem`), and the branching is significant, the performance can degrade. This is especially true when the shelves contain many items, and the function needs to explore multiple paths deeply."

3. **Dynamic Programming State Space in `funb`:**
   - **Invariant:** "The dynamic programming approach in `funb` becomes inefficient when the number of shrieks (`m`) is high, close to the constraint limit (e.g., 10,000), and the function has to recompute many overlapping subproblems."

4. **High Hit Count on Recursive Conditions:**
   - **Invariant:** "When conditions for recursive calls in both `funa` and `funb` trigger frequently due to high values of `rem` or large shelf sizes, it indicates a potential slowdown due to excessive recursive function calls."

These invariants capture the essence of potential performance bottlenecks and help outline conditions under which the program may run slowly. They are not just about maximizing input size but also consider how the algorithm's recursive and dynamic aspects interact with input characteristics.

### Phase 3: Implementing the Invariants as Checker Code in C++

Below are the C++ code snippets that implement the performance-characterizing invariants derived earlier:

1. **Recursive Exploration in `funa`:**

```cpp
void check_recursive_depth_invariant(int shelfSize, int remainingItems) {
    if (shelfSize > 70 && remainingItems > 50) { // arbitrary thresholds
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered in funa - large recursive exploration!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

2. **Depth and Breadth of Recursive Calls:**

```cpp
void check_recursion_breadth_invariant(int recursionDepth, int branchingFactor) {
    if (recursionDepth > 50 && branchingFactor > 20) { // arbitrary thresholds
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high recursion depth and branching factor!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

3. **Dynamic Programming State Space in `funb`:**

```cpp
void check_dynamic_programming_invariant(int m) {
    if (m > 9000) { // near the constraint limit
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered in funb - large dynamic programming state space!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

4. **High Hit Count on Recursive Conditions:**

```cpp
void check_high_hit_count_invariant(int shelfSize, int remainingItems) {
    if (shelfSize > 80 && remainingItems > 40) { // arbitrary thresholds
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive recursive calls!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrating Checker Code into the Original C++ Program

Now, let's integrate these checkers into the original program, ensuring they are placed at effective points in the control flow.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Checker function for recursive exploration in funa
void check_recursive_depth_invariant(int shelfSize, int remainingItems) {
    if (shelfSize > 70 && remainingItems > 50) { // arbitrary thresholds
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered in funa - large recursive exploration!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Checker function for depth and breadth of recursive calls
void check_recursion_breadth_invariant(int recursionDepth, int branchingFactor) {
    if (recursionDepth > 50 && branchingFactor > 20) { // arbitrary thresholds
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high recursion depth and branching factor!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Checker function for dynamic programming state space in funb
void check_dynamic_programming_invariant(int m) {
    if (m > 9000) { // near the constraint limit
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered in funb - large dynamic programming state space!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Checker function for high hit count on recursive conditions
void check_high_hit_count_invariant(int shelfSize, int remainingItems) {
    if (shelfSize > 80 && remainingItems > 40) { // arbitrary thresholds
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive recursive calls!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int n, m;
long long dpa[111][111][111], a[111][111], dpb[111][10011];
int arr[111][111], sz[111], idx;
int vis[111][111][111], cnt = 1;

long long funa(int l, int r, int rem) {
    check_recursive_depth_invariant(r - l + 1, rem); // Check condition for large recursive exploration
    if (!rem || l > r) return 0;
    long long &ret = dpa[l][r][rem];
    if (vis[l][r][rem] == cnt) return ret;
    long long a = arr[idx][l] + funa(l + 1, r, rem - 1);
    long long b = arr[idx][r] + funa(l, r - 1, rem - 1);
    vis[l][r][rem] = cnt;
    return ret = max(a, b);
}

long long funb(int id, int rem) {
    check_dynamic_programming_invariant(rem); // Check condition for large dynamic programming state space
    if (rem == 0) return 0;
    if (id == n) return 0;
    long long &ret = dpb[id][rem];
    if (ret != -1) return ret;
    for (int i = 0; i <= sz[id]; ++i) {
        check_high_hit_count_invariant(sz[id], rem); // Check condition for excessive recursive calls
        if (i <= rem) ret = max(ret, a[id][i] + funb(id + 1, rem - i));
    }
    return ret;
}

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(0);
    cin >> n >> m;
    check_dynamic_programming_invariant(m); // Initial check for large m
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        cin >> sz[i];
        for (int j = 0; j < sz[i]; ++j) cin >> arr[i][j];
    }
    memset(dpb, -1, sizeof dpb);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        idx = i;
        for (int j = 0; j <= sz[i]; ++j) {
            a[i][j] = funa(0, sz[i] - 1, j);
        }
        ++cnt;
    }
    cout << funb(0, m) << '\n';
}
```

### Comments on Checker Placement

- **`check_recursive_depth_invariant`:** Placed in `funa` before recursion to catch large recursive explorations.
- **`check_recursion_breadth_invariant`:** Not explicitly used due to the nature of code logic, but could be integrated where recursion depth is calculated if required.
- **`check_dynamic_programming_invariant`:** Used in `funb` and `main` to catch large dynamic programming state space issues.
- **`check_high_hit_count_invariant`:** Placed in `funb` within the loop to detect excessive recursive calls, ensuring it does not degrade performance further by being overly frequent.
