system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

During her tantrums the princess usually smashes some collectable porcelain. Every furious shriek is accompanied with one item smashed.

The collection of porcelain is arranged neatly on n shelves. Within each shelf the items are placed in one row, so that one can access only the outermost items — the leftmost or the rightmost item, not the ones in the middle of the shelf. Once an item is taken, the next item on that side of the shelf can be accessed (see example). Once an item is taken, it can't be returned to the shelves.

You are given the values of all items. Your task is to find the maximal damage the princess' tantrum of m shrieks can inflict on the collection of porcelain.

Input

The first line of input data contains two integers n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and m (1 ≤ m ≤ 10000). The next n lines contain the values of the items on the shelves: the first number gives the number of items on this shelf (an integer between 1 and 100, inclusive), followed by the values of the items (integers between 1 and 100, inclusive), in the order in which they appear on the shelf (the first number corresponds to the leftmost item, the last one — to the rightmost one). The total number of items is guaranteed to be at least m.

Output

Output the maximal total value of a tantrum of m shrieks.

Examples

Input

2 3
3 3 7 2
3 4 1 5


Output

15


Input

1 3
4 4 3 1 2


Output

9

Note

In the first case there are two shelves, each with three items. To maximize the total value of the items chosen, one can take two items from the left side of the first shelf and one item from the right side of the second shelf.

In the second case there is only one shelf, so all three items are taken from it — two from the left side and one from the right side.

assistant: To diagnose the performance bottlenecks in the given C program, let's go through each phase as described:

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Comparison of Hit Counts:**  
   - The function `funpre` (lines 46-56) is called significantly more often on the slow input (343,501 times) compared to the fast input (only 4 times).
   - The function `fun` (lines 29-42) also experiences more calls in the slow input (70 times) compared to the fast (3 times).

2. **Pinpointing Lines or Functions with High Hit Counts:**
   - The line `pre[i][j] = funpre(0, koto[i] - 1, j);` (line 73) is called 101 times for slow input versus 2 for fast input. This suggests that the calculation of prefix sums with `funpre` is significantly more frequent.
   - The recursive calls within `funpre` (lines 54-55) and `fun` (line 40) indicate deep recursion or high branching in the slow input.

3. **Inference on Interactions with Data Structures:**
   - The nested loop and recursive structure in `funpre` and `fun` suggest that the program is spending a lot of time calculating combinations of item selections from the shelves. The recursive nature of these functions, combined with the dynamic programming approach, suggests exponential growth in recursive calls as the function tries to explore optimal item selections.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the identified slow paths and code structure, we can derive the following performance-characterizing invariants in natural language:

1. **High Recursion Depth Due to Large `m`:**
   - Natural Language Invariant: "If the number of shrieks `m` is large relative to the number of items on the shelves, the recursive exploration of possible item selections can become very deep, resulting in significant slowdowns."

2. **Repeated DP Table Calculations:**
   - Natural Language Invariant: "When the program recalculates values in the dynamic programming table for many combinations of positions and remaining shrieks, particularly with large `m` or in cases where the shelves have many items, performance can degrade."

3. **Large Number of Items on a Single Shelf:**
   - Natural Language Invariant: "If a single shelf contains many items, the recursive function that calculates possible combinations of item removal can be triggered excessively, leading to a substantial increase in computation time."

4. **Deep Exploration of Item Selection Combinations:**
   - Natural Language Invariant: "When the number of shelves `n` is small but the number of items per shelf is high, and `m` approaches the number of items on a shelf, the program's recursive exploration of left and right item selections can become extensive, slowing down execution significantly."

These invariants abstract the conditions that trigger performance issues without relying on specific numeric values from the slow input, and they align with the problem's constraints (e.g., `n <= 100`, `m <= 10000`). They also highlight potential future slow scenarios if similar input patterns are encountered.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
During her tantrums the princess usually smashes some collectable porcelain. Every furious shriek is accompanied with one item smashed.

The collection of porcelain is arranged neatly on n shelves. Within each shelf the items are placed in one row, so that one can access only the outermost items — the leftmost or the rightmost item, not the ones in the middle of the shelf. Once an item is taken, the next item on that side of the shelf can be accessed (see example). Once an item is taken, it can't be returned to the shelves.

You are given the values of all items. Your task is to find the maximal damage the princess' tantrum of m shrieks can inflict on the collection of porcelain.

Input

The first line of input data contains two integers n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and m (1 ≤ m ≤ 10000). The next n lines contain the values of the items on the shelves: the first number gives the number of items on this shelf (an integer between 1 and 100, inclusive), followed by the values of the items (integers between 1 and 100, inclusive), in the order in which they appear on the shelf (the first number corresponds to the leftmost item, the last one — to the rightmost one). The total number of items is guaranteed to be at least m.

Output

Output the maximal total value of a tantrum of m shrieks.

Examples

Input

2 3
3 3 7 2
3 4 1 5


Output

15


Input

1 3
4 4 3 1 2


Output

9

Note

In the first case there are two shelves, each with three items. To maximize the total value of the items chosen, one can take two items from the left side of the first shelf and one item from the right side of the second shelf.

In the second case there is only one shelf, so all three items are taken from it — two from the left side and one from the right side.

Solution (C++ code):
{solution}


assistant: ### Phase 3: Implementing the Natural Language Invariants in C++

Below are the C++ code snippets implementing the performance-characterizing invariants identified in natural language:

1. **Invariant for Large `m` Relative to Items:**

   ```cpp
   void check_large_m_invariant(int m, int totalItems) {
       if (m > totalItems / 2) { // Assumes m close to total items is a problem
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - m is large relative to items!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Invariant for Repeated DP Table Calculations:**

   ```cpp
   void check_dp_recalculation_invariant(int n, int m) {
       if (n * m > 10000) { // This condition detects heavy DP recalculations
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive DP recalculations!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Invariant for Large Number of Items on a Single Shelf:**

   ```cpp
   void check_large_shelf_invariant(int shelfItems) {
       if (shelfItems > 75) { // Arbitrary threshold for large shelf
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large number of items on a single shelf!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

4. **Invariant for Deep Exploration of Item Selection:**

   ```cpp
   void check_deep_exploration_invariant(int n, int m, int maxShelfItems) {
       if (n < 3 && maxShelfItems > 50 && m > 50) { // Conditions for deep exploration
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - deep exploration of item selection!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Integrating the Checkers into the Program

Below is the modified C++ code with the integrated checkers:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
long long INF = 1 << 28;
const double pi = acos(-1.0);
int fx[] = {1, -1, 0, 0};
int fy[] = {0, 0, 1, -1};
int dir[4][2] = {1, 0, -1, 0, 0, -1, 0, 1};
int knight[8][2] = {1, 2, 1, -2, 2, 1, 2, -1, -1, 2, -1, -2, -2, 1, -2, -1};
const long double EPS = 1e-7;
long long gcd(long long a, long long b) {
    if (b == 0)
        return a;
    else
        return gcd(b, a % b);
}
long long lcm(long long a, long long b) { return a / gcd(a, b) * b; }
bool cmp(int a, int b) { return a < b; }
int on(int mask, int st) { return mask | (1 << st); }
int off(int mask, int st) { return mask & (~(1 << st)); }
bool check(int mask, int st) { return mask & (1 << st); }
long long inf = 1e18;
long long MOD = 1e9 + 7;
long long mod = 1e9;

// Phase 3: Adding the checkers functions
void check_large_m_invariant(int m, int totalItems) {
    if (m > totalItems / 2) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - m is large relative to items!" << endl;
        abort();

        abort();
    }
}

long long pre[200][200];
long long dp[110][10010];

long long fun(int pos, int k) {
    if (k == 0) {
        return 0;
    }
    if (pos == n) {
        return 0;
    }
    long long &ret = dp[pos][k];
    if (ret != -1) return ret;
    long long ans = 0;

        totalItems += koto[i];
        check_large_shelf_invariant(koto[i]);  // Check for large shelf

    cout << fun(0, m) << endl;

}
```

### Explanation of Checker Integration

- **Location of Checkers:** The checkers are placed right after reading the inputs. This ensures that any potentially problematic input is flagged before the main computation begins, preventing additional overhead during the computation.
- **Function-based Checkers:** Each checker is encapsulated in a function to keep the main code clean and modular. This also allows for easy extension or modification of checker conditions.
