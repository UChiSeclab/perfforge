system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

During her tantrums the princess usually smashes some collectable porcelain. Every furious shriek is accompanied with one item smashed.

The collection of porcelain is arranged neatly on n shelves. Within each shelf the items are placed in one row, so that one can access only the outermost items — the leftmost or the rightmost item, not the ones in the middle of the shelf. Once an item is taken, the next item on that side of the shelf can be accessed (see example). Once an item is taken, it can't be returned to the shelves.

You are given the values of all items. Your task is to find the maximal damage the princess' tantrum of m shrieks can inflict on the collection of porcelain.

Input

The first line of input data contains two integers n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and m (1 ≤ m ≤ 10000). The next n lines contain the values of the items on the shelves: the first number gives the number of items on this shelf (an integer between 1 and 100, inclusive), followed by the values of the items (integers between 1 and 100, inclusive), in the order in which they appear on the shelf (the first number corresponds to the leftmost item, the last one — to the rightmost one). The total number of items is guaranteed to be at least m.

Output

Output the maximal total value of a tantrum of m shrieks.

Examples

Input

2 3
3 3 7 2
3 4 1 5


Output

15


Input

1 3
4 4 3 1 2


Output

9

Note

In the first case there are two shelves, each with three items. To maximize the total value of the items chosen, one can take two items from the left side of the first shelf and one item from the right side of the second shelf.

In the second case there is only one shelf, so all three items are taken from it — two from the left side and one from the right side.

assistant: To analyze the performance bottlenecks in the provided C program, we need to compare the line-level hit counts between the fast and slow inputs. Below is the analysis and the derived performance-characterizing invariants based on this comparison:

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Function `prec`**: 
   - This function is significantly more hit in the slow input than the fast input (343,501 vs. 4 times).
   - Particularly, the recursive calls within this function (`line 13`), which involve taking the maximum of two recursive paths, are hit heavily. This suggests that the recursion depth and frequency are likely causing the slowdown.

2. **Function `call`**:
   - This function is also more hit during the slow input run, particularly within its loop (`line 16` to `line 30`). However, the difference is not as stark as with `prec`.

3. **Interaction with Data Structures**:
   - The recursion in `prec` seems to explore a large space, and the function likely evaluates many paths due to the high branching factor caused by the choices between left and right items on shelves.
   - The `adj` vector and dynamic programming table `fp` are being filled using values computed by `prec`, indicating that redundant computations could be avoided through more effective memoization.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the identified inefficiencies, here are the natural language invariants that describe conditions for potential slowdowns:

1. **Recursive Depth and Branching**:
   - Natural Language Description: "If the recursive computation in `prec` involves high depth and branching, especially when m (the number of shrieks) approaches its upper limit, the program may experience significant slowdowns."
   - Context: Given that m can be up to 10,000, the recursion depth and the repeated evaluations of paths can lead to exponential time costs.

2. **Dynamic Programming with Large Inputs**:
   - Natural Language Description: "When processing shelves with many items, and when a large number of shrieks are possible (values of m close to 10,000), the dynamic programming approach in `call` may not efficiently prune unnecessary computations, leading to performance degradation."
   - Context: The dynamic programming approach should ideally store results to avoid recomputation, but inefficiencies in how the problem is decomposed can lead to repeated evaluations.

3. **Repeated Processing of Shelves**:
   - Natural Language Description: "If each shelf contains close to the maximum number of items (100), and the method iterates over these items multiple times due to poor memoization or branching decisions, the program may slow down."
   - Context: Large shelves with multiple accessible items increase the solution space, especially when m is large, leading to redundant exploration of item combinations.

These invariants highlight areas where the program could be optimized by minimizing redundant recursive calls and improving memoization strategies. Additionally, considering alternative problem decompositions or iterative solutions may further enhance performance under challenging inputs.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
During her tantrums the princess usually smashes some collectable porcelain. Every furious shriek is accompanied with one item smashed.

The collection of porcelain is arranged neatly on n shelves. Within each shelf the items are placed in one row, so that one can access only the outermost items — the leftmost or the rightmost item, not the ones in the middle of the shelf. Once an item is taken, the next item on that side of the shelf can be accessed (see example). Once an item is taken, it can't be returned to the shelves.

You are given the values of all items. Your task is to find the maximal damage the princess' tantrum of m shrieks can inflict on the collection of porcelain.

Input

The first line of input data contains two integers n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and m (1 ≤ m ≤ 10000). The next n lines contain the values of the items on the shelves: the first number gives the number of items on this shelf (an integer between 1 and 100, inclusive), followed by the values of the items (integers between 1 and 100, inclusive), in the order in which they appear on the shelf (the first number corresponds to the leftmost item, the last one — to the rightmost one). The total number of items is guaranteed to be at least m.

Output

Output the maximal total value of a tantrum of m shrieks.

Examples

Input

2 3
3 3 7 2
3 4 1 5


Output

15


Input

1 3
4 4 3 1 2


Output

9

Note

In the first case there are two shelves, each with three items. To maximize the total value of the items chosen, one can take two items from the left side of the first shelf and one item from the right side of the second shelf.

In the second case there is only one shelf, so all three items are taken from it — two from the left side and one from the right side.

Solution (C++ code):
{solution}


assistant: Let's proceed with Phase 3 by writing C++ checker functions based on the performance-characterizing invariants inferred in Phase 2.

### Phase 3: Implement the Natural Language Invariants in C++

1. **Recursive Depth and Branching**:
   - We need to check if the recursive depth and branching in the `prec` function are likely to lead to slowdowns. We will estimate this based on `m`, the number of shrieks, and the number of items `n`.

   ```cpp
   void check_recursion_invariant(int rem, int i, int j, int m, int depth) {
       if (depth > m) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to high recursion depth and branching!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Large Dynamic Programming Table**:
   - Check if the dynamic programming table sizes and access patterns are leading to inefficient computation.

   ```cpp
   void check_dp_invariant(int n, int m, int currentK, int maxK) {
       if (currentK > maxK) {
           cerr << "Warning: Dynamic programming table access exceeds expected range!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Repeated Processing of Shelves**:
   - The number of items per shelf and shrieks can indicate potential performance issues when shelves have near-maximum items.

   ```cpp
   void check_shelf_invariant(int shelfSize, int maxItems) {
       if (shelfSize > maxItems) {
           cerr << "Warning: Large shelf size may cause slow processing!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

Now, let's move to Phase 4, where we integrate these checks into the original C++ program.

### Phase 4: Integrate Checkers into the Original Program

Here is the instrumented version of the original C++ program with the integrated checker functions:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int dp[101][101][101], fp[101][10001];
int vis[101][101][101];
int a[101], m, cs = 0;
vector<int> adj[105];

void check_recursion_invariant(int rem, int i, int j, int m, int depth) {
    if (depth > m) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to high recursion depth and branching!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_dp_invariant(int n, int m, int currentK, int maxK) {
    if (currentK > maxK) {
        cerr << "Warning: Dynamic programming table access exceeds expected range!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_shelf_invariant(int shelfSize, int maxItems) {
    if (shelfSize > maxItems) {
        cerr << "Warning: Large shelf size may cause slow processing!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int prec(int rem, int i, int j, int depth = 0) {
    check_recursion_invariant(rem, i, j, m, depth); // Checking recursion depth
    if (rem == 0) return 0;
    if (i > j) return 0;
    if (vis[rem][i][j] == cs) return dp[rem][i][j];
    vis[rem][i][j] = cs;
    int ret = 0;
    ret = max(a[i] + prec(rem - 1, i + 1, j, depth + 1), a[j] + prec(rem - 1, i, j - 1, depth + 1));
    return dp[rem][i][j] = ret;
}

int call(int pos, int k) {
    check_dp_invariant(pos, m, k, 10000); // Checking dynamic programming table usage
    if (k == 0) return 0;
    if (pos == 0) return 0;
    if (fp[pos][k] != -1) return fp[pos][k];
    int ret = 0;
    int sz = adj[pos].front();
    ret = max(ret, call(pos - 1, k));
    for (int i = 1; i <= sz; i++) {
        if (i <= k) {
            int tmp = adj[pos][i] + call(pos - 1, k - i);
            ret = max(ret, tmp);
        } else
            break;
    }
    return fp[pos][k] = ret;
}

int main() {
    int n, k;
    scanf("%d %d", &n, &k);
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        scanf("%d", &m);
        check_shelf_invariant(m, 100); // Checking shelf size
        for (int j = 1; j <= m; j++) scanf("%d", &a[j]);
        ++cs;
        int foo = prec(m, 1, m);
        adj[i].push_back(m);
        for (int j = 1; j <= m; j++) adj[i].push_back(prec(j, 1, m));
    }
    memset(fp, -1, sizeof(fp));
    int ret = call(n, k);
    printf("%d\n", ret);
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:

- **`check_recursion_invariant`**: This is called inside `prec` to track the recursion depth. It checks if the depth exceeds a reasonable threshold based on `m`.
  
- **`check_dp_invariant`**: Inserted inside `call` to ensure dynamic programming table indices remain within practical bounds.

- **`check_shelf_invariant`**: Called after reading the number of items per shelf to warn if the shelf is very large.

These checks are strategically placed to avoid significant overhead while monitoring conditions that could lead to performance bottlenecks.
