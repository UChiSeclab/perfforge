**Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments**

Upon comparing the line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs, we notice the following:

1. **Recursive Tree Building (Lines 6-13)**: The `build` function gets called significantly more in the slow input (255 times) as compared to the fast input (3 times). This is indicative of the larger input size leading to more recursive calls for constructing the segment tree.

2. **Frequent Updates (Lines 15-26)**: The `update` function is invoked 5192 times in the slow run as opposed to just 2 times in the fast run. This function is responsible for updating the segment tree nodes, and its high hit count in the slow run suggests that it is a major contributor to the slowdown.

3. **Numerous Queries (Lines 27-36)**: The `query` function is called 5919 times in the slow input, compared to 2 times in the fast input. This indicates that multiple queries are being made on the segment tree to determine the minimum bribes needed throughout the tournament, likely due to the larger number of stages and matchups present in the larger input size.

4. **Nested Loop Operations (Lines 57-73)**: The nested loops, particularly the inner loop (lines 59-72), show a significant number of iterations in the slow input, with notable operations inside the loop such as `query` and `update`. These hit counts suggest that the loop execution grows quadratically with the number of boxers, impacting the performance.

**Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants**

1. **Invariant Regarding Segment Tree Operations:**
   - Natural Language Description: "If the input size is large, constructing and updating the segment tree frequently can lead to increased computational overhead. This situation arises from recursive operations and repeated updates, which expand exponentially with input size."
   - This invariant suggests that the deeper the recursion in the `build` function and the more updates in the `update` function, the more expensive the computation becomes.

2. **Invariant Concerning Recursive Data Structure Traversal:**
   - Natural Language Description: "When the number of boxers is large, recursive queries and updates on the segment tree become more frequent, leading to potential slowdowns due to repeated tree traversals."
   - Especially as `n` approaches its maximum value of `2^18`, the recursive nature of these functions becomes a bottleneck.

3. **Invariant on Nested Loop Complexity:**
   - Natural Language Description: "If the number of tournament stages is high, akin to a large input size, the nested loops responsible for managing pairings and bribes can significantly slow down the program due to the quadratic growth in operations."
   - The loops are indicative of complexity that grows with the number of rounds and matches, where each round potentially doubles the operations required.

4. **Invariant on Input Size Impact:**
   - Natural Language Description: "When handling maximum constraints like n = 2^18, the algorithm's time complexity can lead to slow performance due to the compounded effect of segment tree operations and nested loops."
   - This suggests a threshold where algorithmic inefficiencies become apparent as `n` increases, particularly towards its upper constraint.

**Phase 3: Implement the Natural Language Invariants in C++**

Let's translate the natural language invariants into C++ code snippets. Each code snippet will check a specific performance bottleneck condition:

1. **Invariant Regarding Segment Tree Operations:**

   ```cpp
   void check_segment_tree_operations(int n, long long operationCount) {
       if (operationCount > n * log2(n)) { // Checking if operations exceed a reasonable threshold
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck in segment tree operations!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Invariant Concerning Recursive Data Structure Traversal:**

   ```cpp
   void check_recursive_traversal(int recursionDepth, int n) {
       if (recursionDepth > log2(n) + 10) { // A threshold slightly exceeding log2(n) to account for worst cases
           cerr << "Warning: Recursion depth exceeding expected limits!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Invariant on Nested Loop Complexity:**

   ```cpp
   void check_nested_loops(int loopIterations, int n) {
       if (loopIterations > n * log2(n)) { // Checking if nested loops are iterated excessively
           cerr << "Warning: Excessive iterations in nested loops!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

4. **Invariant on Input Size Impact:**

   ```cpp
   void check_input_size(int n) {
       if (n >= (1 << 18)) { // Max constraint as per problem statement
           cerr << "Warning: Input size at maximum constraint, potential slowdown!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

**Phase 4: Integrate the Checker Code into the Original Program**

Now, we integrate these checker functions into the original C++ program to monitor the potential performance bottlenecks:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
const int N = (2 << 18);
const long long INF = 2e18;
long long seg[N << 2];

void check_segment_tree_operations(int n, long long operationCount) {
    if (operationCount > n * log2(n)) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck in segment tree operations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_recursive_traversal(int recursionDepth, int n) {
    if (recursionDepth > log2(n) + 10) {
        cerr << "Warning: Recursion depth exceeding expected limits!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_nested_loops(int loopIterations, int n) {
    if (loopIterations > n * log2(n)) {
        cerr << "Warning: Excessive iterations in nested loops!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_input_size(int n) {
    if (n >= (1 << 18)) {
        cerr << "Warning: Input size at maximum constraint, potential slowdown!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void build(int rt, int l, int r, int depth) {
    check_recursive_traversal(depth, N);
    seg[rt] = INF;
    if (l == r) {
        return;
    }
    int mid = l + r >> 1;
    build(rt << 1, l, mid, depth + 1);
    build(rt << 1 | 1, mid + 1, r, depth + 1);
}

void update(int rt, int l, int r, int x, long long w, long long& updateCount) {
    updateCount++;
    if (l == r) {
        seg[rt] = w;
        return;
    }
    int mid = l + r >> 1;
    if (x <= mid)
        update(rt << 1, l, mid, x, w, updateCount);
    else
        update(rt << 1 | 1, mid + 1, r, x, w, updateCount);
    seg[rt] = min(seg[rt << 1 | 1], seg[rt << 1]);
}

long long query(int rt, int l, int r, int x, int y, long long& queryCount) {
    queryCount++;
    if (x <= l && y >= r) {
        return seg[rt];
    }
    int mid = l + r >> 1;
    long long res = INF;
    if (x <= mid) res = min(res, query(rt << 1, l, mid, x, y, queryCount));
    if (y > mid) res = min(res, query(rt << 1 | 1, mid + 1, r, x, y, queryCount));
    return res;
}

long long a[N], dp[N];

int main() {
    int n;
    scanf("%d", &n);
    
    // Check input size for potential slowdown
    check_input_size(n);
    
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) scanf("%lld", a + i);
    int cnt = 0, m = n;
    while (m) {
        m >>= 1;
        cnt++;
    }

    build(1, 1, n, 0); // Initialize the segment tree, track recursion depth

    long long updateCount = 0, queryCount = 0;
    
    dp[n] = a[n];
    if (a[n] == -1) {
        printf("0\n");
        return 0;
    }
    
    update(1, 1, n, n, dp[n], updateCount);
    long long ans = -1;
    cnt--;
    m = 1;

    int loopIterations = 0;

    for (int i = 1; i <= cnt; i++) {
        if (ans != -1) break;
        for (int j = (1 << (cnt - i)); j <= n; j++) {
            loopIterations++;
            if (j > n - i) {
                dp[j] = INF;
                update(1, 1, n, j, dp[j], updateCount);
                continue;
            }
            long long res = query(1, 1, n, j + 1, n, queryCount);
            dp[j] = res + a[j];
            if (a[j] == -1) {
                ans = res;
                break;
            }
            update(1, 1, n, j, dp[j], updateCount);
        }
        m++;
    }

    // Check for excessive nested loop iterations
    check_nested_loops(loopIterations, n);

    // Check the segment tree operation counts
    check_segment_tree_operations(n, updateCount + queryCount);

    printf("%lld\n", ans);
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Recursion Depth Checker**: Added to the `build` function to ensure the recursion doesn't exceed expected limits.
- **Segment Tree Operation Checkers**: Track the number of `update` and `query` operations to detect excessive operations.
- **Nested Loop Checker**: Counts iterations of nested loops to ensure they don't exceed expected bounds.
- **Input Size Checker**: Immediately checks the size of `n` to detect when it's at the upper end of constraints.
