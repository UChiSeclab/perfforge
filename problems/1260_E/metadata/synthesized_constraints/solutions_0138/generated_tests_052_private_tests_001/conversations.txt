system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

You are organizing a boxing tournament, where n boxers will participate (n is a power of 2), and your friend is one of them. All boxers have different strength from 1 to n, and boxer i wins in the match against boxer j if and only if i is stronger than j.

The tournament will be organized as follows: n boxers will be divided into pairs; the loser in each pair leaves the tournament, and n/2 winners advance to the next stage, where they are divided into pairs again, and the winners in all pairs advance to the next stage, and so on, until only one boxer remains (who is declared the winner).

Your friend really wants to win the tournament, but he may be not the strongest boxer. To help your friend win the tournament, you may bribe his opponents: if your friend is fighting with a boxer you have bribed, your friend wins even if his strength is lower.

Furthermore, during each stage you distribute the boxers into pairs as you wish.

The boxer with strength i can be bribed if you pay him a_i dollars. What is the minimum number of dollars you have to spend to make your friend win the tournament, provided that you arrange the boxers into pairs during each stage as you wish?

Input

The first line contains one integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2^{18}) — the number of boxers. n is a power of 2.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, where a_i is the number of dollars you have to pay if you want to bribe the boxer with strength i. Exactly one of a_i is equal to -1 — it means that the boxer with strength i is your friend. All other values are in the range [1, 10^9].

Output

Print one integer — the minimum number of dollars you have to pay so your friend wins.

Note

In the first test case no matter how you will distribute boxers into pairs, your friend is the strongest boxer and anyway wins the tournament.

In the second test case you can distribute boxers as follows (your friend is number 2):

1 : 2, 8 : 5, 7 : 3, 6 : 4 (boxers 2, 8, 7 and 6 advance to the next stage);

2 : 6, 8 : 7 (boxers 2 and 8 advance to the next stage, you have to bribe the boxer with strength 6);

2 : 8 (you have to bribe the boxer with strength 8);

(F) Program Solving the Problem Statement

using namespace std;
long long a[(1 << 18) + 5], pos, n;
long long calc[30], dp[(1 << 18) + 5][20];

  if (bribe > 18) return 1e18;
  if (dp[u][bribe] != -1) return dp[u][bribe];
  int len = n - u + 1;
  long long res = solve(u - 1, bribe + 1) + a[u];

assistant: ### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Analyze Hit Counts:** 
   - The function `solve` has significantly higher hit counts for the slow input compared to the fast input (3998 vs. 2). This indicates that `solve` is a primary contributor to the slowdown.
   - Lines within `solve`, particularly lines 7, 8, 10, 11, and 12, also show higher hit counts, suggesting they are repeatedly executed.
   - The recursion in `solve` (lines 10 and 11 calling `solve` again) is a likely source of inefficiency, especially with larger inputs.

2. **Interactions with Data Structures:**
   - The array `dp` is used for memoization, checked at line 8, but recursive calls still happen frequently, possibly due to incomplete memoization or high variability in parameters leading to cache misses.

3. **Recursion and Loop Analysis:**
   - Recursion in `solve` is heavily influenced by the parameters `u` and `bribe`, where a deep recursion tree can form based on these.
   - The decision to recurse multiple times with different parameters (line 11) implies repeated computations that might be avoidable with better state management.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the above analysis, here are potential performance-characterizing invariants:

1. **Recursive Depth and Parameters:**
   - **Invariant:** "If the recursion depth in `solve` grows with increasing complexity due to multiple parameters (like `bribe`), and recursive calls are not effectively memoized, the computation may become expensive."
   - **Explanation:** The intertwined recursion with parameters `u` and `bribe` can lead to exponential calls if not bounded or optimized, especially as `n` increases.

2. **Memoization Inefficiencies:**
   - **Invariant:** "If memoization in the `solve` function does not cover a significant portion of the state space, especially when `n` is large, repeated calculations can degrade performance."
   - **Explanation:** The `dp` array is meant to prevent redundant calculations, but if it is not utilized effectively, the recursion tree remains large.

3. **Recursive Branching:**
   - **Invariant:** "If branching in recursive calls (specifically at line 11) is triggered frequently due to complex conditions, leading to multiple recursive paths, execution time can increase substantially."
   - **Explanation:** The condition `calc[bribe] >= len` in line 11 decides whether to take an alternative recursive path, potentially triggering more computations.

4. **Function Call Overhead:**
   - **Invariant:** "If the recursive function `solve` is called excessively, the overhead associated with function calls and stack usage might become a bottleneck when `n` is large."
   - **Explanation:** This reflects the cost of recursion itself, where the overhead of setting up stack frames and managing deep call stacks can slow execution.

These invariants suggest that the slowdown is primarily due to inefficient recursion and memoization strategies that become critical as input size grows, leading to extensive redundant computations. Optimizing these areas or rethinking the recursive strategy can mitigate performance issues.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
You are organizing a boxing tournament, where n boxers will participate (n is a power of 2), and your friend is one of them. All boxers have different strength from 1 to n, and boxer i wins in the match against boxer j if and only if i is stronger than j.

The tournament will be organized as follows: n boxers will be divided into pairs; the loser in each pair leaves the tournament, and n/2 winners advance to the next stage, where they are divided into pairs again, and the winners in all pairs advance to the next stage, and so on, until only one boxer remains (who is declared the winner).

Your friend really wants to win the tournament, but he may be not the strongest boxer. To help your friend win the tournament, you may bribe his opponents: if your friend is fighting with a boxer you have bribed, your friend wins even if his strength is lower.

Furthermore, during each stage you distribute the boxers into pairs as you wish.

The boxer with strength i can be bribed if you pay him a_i dollars. What is the minimum number of dollars you have to spend to make your friend win the tournament, provided that you arrange the boxers into pairs during each stage as you wish?

Input

The first line contains one integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2^{18}) — the number of boxers. n is a power of 2.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, where a_i is the number of dollars you have to pay if you want to bribe the boxer with strength i. Exactly one of a_i is equal to -1 — it means that the boxer with strength i is your friend. All other values are in the range [1, 10^9].

Output

Print one integer — the minimum number of dollars you have to pay so your friend wins.

Examples

Input


4
3 9 1 -1


Output


0

Input


8
11 -1 13 19 24 7 17 5


Output

Note

In the first test case no matter how you will distribute boxers into pairs, your friend is the strongest boxer and anyway wins the tournament.

In the second test case you can distribute boxers as follows (your friend is number 2):

1 : 2, 8 : 5, 7 : 3, 6 : 4 (boxers 2, 8, 7 and 6 advance to the next stage);

2 : 6, 8 : 7 (boxers 2 and 8 advance to the next stage, you have to bribe the boxer with strength 6);

2 : 8 (you have to bribe the boxer with strength 8);

Solution (C++ code):
{solution}


assistant: ### Phase 3: Implement the Natural Language Invariants in C++

Let's translate the performance-characterizing invariants into C++ code that can be used as runtime checks. This code will help diagnose potential bottlenecks.

1. **Recursive Depth and Parameters Check:**
   - We will check if recursion depth or the number of recursive calls in the `solve` function exceeds a certain threshold.

```cpp
void check_recursion_invariant(int depth, int threshold) {
    if (depth > threshold) {
        cerr << "Warning: Recursion depth exceeds threshold, potential performance bottleneck!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

2. **Memoization Inefficiency Check:**
   - We will ensure that the memoization table is effectively used by monitoring cache misses.

```cpp
void check_memoization_invariant(long long dpValue) {
    if (dpValue == -1) {
        cerr << "Warning: Frequent cache misses in memoization detected, performance may degrade!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

3. **Recursive Branching Check:**
   - We will track the branching factor and ensure it doesn't lead to excessive recursive paths.

```cpp
void check_branching_invariant(int branchCount, int maxBranches) {
    if (branchCount > maxBranches) {
        cerr << "Warning: Excessive branching in recursive calls, potential performance degradation!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

4. **Function Call Overhead Check:**
   - Monitor the number of recursive calls and ensure it doesn't exceed a manageable threshold.

```cpp
void check_function_call_invariant(int callCount, int maxCalls) {
    if (callCount > maxCalls) {
        cerr << "Warning: Excessive function calls detected, possible performance bottleneck!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrate Checker Code into the Original Program

Now, let's integrate these checks into the given C++ program at strategic points to avoid adding overhead in tight loops.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

long long a[(1 << 18) + 5], pos, n;
long long calc[30], dp[(1 << 18) + 5][20];

// Checkers for invariants
void check_recursion_invariant(int depth, int threshold) {
    if (depth > threshold) {
        cerr << "Warning: Recursion depth exceeds threshold, potential performance bottleneck!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

### Comments on Integration

- **Recursion Depth and Calls:** I've placed the `check_function_call_invariant` at the start of `solve` to monitor the overall number of recursive calls. This helps in detecting when the recursive strategy might be inefficient.
- **Memoization:** The `check_memoization_invariant` is added right before the memoization check to ensure we monitor cache misses.
- **Branching Factor:** The `check_branching_invariant` is applied to track the condition when the recursive path might branch excessively.

These checks are strategically placed to capture performance bottlenecks without adding overhead to critical execution paths. Adjust thresholds (`10000` for calls) based on expected behavior and constraints (`n <= 2^18`).
