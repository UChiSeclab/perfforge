system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

The only difference between easy and hard versions is constraints.

Ivan plays a computer game that contains some microtransactions to make characters look cooler. Since Ivan wants his character to be really cool, he wants to use some of these microtransactions — and he won't start playing until he gets all of them.

Each day (during the morning) Ivan earns exactly one burle.

There are n types of microtransactions in the game. Each microtransaction costs 2 burles usually and 1 burle if it is on sale. Ivan has to order exactly k_i microtransactions of the i-th type (he orders microtransactions during the evening).

Ivan can order any (possibly zero) number of microtransactions of any types during any day (of course, if he has enough money to do it). If the microtransaction he wants to order is on sale then he can buy it for 1 burle and otherwise he can buy it for 2 burles.

There are also m special offers in the game shop. The j-th offer (d_j, t_j) means that microtransactions of the t_j-th type are on sale during the d_j-th day.

Ivan wants to order all microtransactions as soon as possible. Your task is to calculate the minimum day when he can buy all microtransactions he want and actually start playing.

Input

The first line of the input contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000) — the number of types of microtransactions and the number of special offers in the game shop.

The second line of the input contains n integers k_1, k_2, ..., k_n (0 ≤ k_i ≤ 1000), where k_i is the number of copies of microtransaction of the i-th type Ivan has to order. It is guaranteed that sum of all k_i is not less than 1 and not greater than 1000.

The next m lines contain special offers. The j-th of these lines contains the j-th special offer. It is given as a pair of integers (d_j, t_j) (1 ≤ d_j ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ t_j ≤ n) and means that microtransactions of the t_j-th type are on sale during the d_j-th day.

Output

Print one integer — the minimum day when Ivan can order all microtransactions he wants and actually start playing.

assistant: ### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Comparison of Line-Level Hit Counts:**
   - Lines within the `chk` lambda function (lines 22-41) are executed significantly more times in the slow input than in the fast input.
   - Specifically, the loop starting at line 24 and the nested loop at line 32 show a notable increase in hit counts for the slow input.
   - The `lower_bound` operation at line 25 and the loop at line 34 also show increased hits for the slow case.

2. **Pinpoint Significant Lines:**
   - **Line 24:** Iterates over the types of microtransactions and performs a binary search for each type to determine sales up to a given day.
   - **Line 32:** Iterates over each day up to the current guess (`mid`) in the binary search, adjusting the available currency and purchased microtransactions.
   - **Line 34:** Iterates over the microtransactions that are on sale for a particular day and purchases them.

3. **Inference of Interactions:**
   - A binary search process is utilized to approximate the earliest day Ivan can purchase all microtransactions. The `chk` function is designed to simulate the purchasing process for a prospective day count.
   - The slowdown occurs because of the repeated simulation of purchasing microtransactions up to `mid` days, especially when microtransactions are frequently checked or purchased during these iterations.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **Natural Language Performance Invariants:**

   - **Invariant 1:** "If there are many microtransaction types, each with varying and high required quantities, and they have sporadic sales days, the program may slow down due to extensive simulations of purchasing sequences."
     - **Threshold Reflection:** The slowdown is more pronounced when the number of microtransactions `n` is large and the sum of `k_i` values (microtransactions needed per type) is closer to the upper constraint (1000).
   
   - **Invariant 2:** "When special offers are sparse and spread out over many days relative to the required microtransaction types, the binary search process to find the earliest possible purchasing day may extend significantly, leading to slower execution."
     - **Threshold Reflection:** This condition reflects a scenario where `m` is relatively small compared to `n`, causing more days to be checked for potential purchases.

   - **Invariant 3:** "If the necessary purchases per microtransaction type are large and disproportionately concentrated on a few types, the repetitive checks for sales and purchases may result in increased computation time."
     - **Threshold Reflection:** Applies when there is a high concentration of needed microtransactions (`k_i`) on a few types, leading to more iterations in loops during the simulation process.

These invariants characterize the conditions under which the code might enter a slow path without relying on specific input values, instead using the constraints and patterns that could cause bottlenecks.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
The only difference between easy and hard versions is constraints.

Ivan plays a computer game that contains some microtransactions to make characters look cooler. Since Ivan wants his character to be really cool, he wants to use some of these microtransactions — and he won't start playing until he gets all of them.

Each day (during the morning) Ivan earns exactly one burle.

There are n types of microtransactions in the game. Each microtransaction costs 2 burles usually and 1 burle if it is on sale. Ivan has to order exactly k_i microtransactions of the i-th type (he orders microtransactions during the evening).

Ivan can order any (possibly zero) number of microtransactions of any types during any day (of course, if he has enough money to do it). If the microtransaction he wants to order is on sale then he can buy it for 1 burle and otherwise he can buy it for 2 burles.

There are also m special offers in the game shop. The j-th offer (d_j, t_j) means that microtransactions of the t_j-th type are on sale during the d_j-th day.

Ivan wants to order all microtransactions as soon as possible. Your task is to calculate the minimum day when he can buy all microtransactions he want and actually start playing.

Input

The first line of the input contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000) — the number of types of microtransactions and the number of special offers in the game shop.

The second line of the input contains n integers k_1, k_2, ..., k_n (0 ≤ k_i ≤ 1000), where k_i is the number of copies of microtransaction of the i-th type Ivan has to order. It is guaranteed that sum of all k_i is not less than 1 and not greater than 1000.

The next m lines contain special offers. The j-th of these lines contains the j-th special offer. It is given as a pair of integers (d_j, t_j) (1 ≤ d_j ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ t_j ≤ n) and means that microtransactions of the t_j-th type are on sale during the d_j-th day.

Output

Print one integer — the minimum day when Ivan can order all microtransactions he wants and actually start playing.

Let's translate the identified performance-characterizing invariants into runtime checks in C++. We'll use the specified template and ensure that the checks are faithful to the natural language descriptions.

#### Invariant 1 Implementation

```cpp
void check_microtransaction_structure(int n, const vector<int>& k) {
    int total_microtransactions = accumulate(k.begin(), k.end(), 0);
    if (n > 900 && total_microtransactions > 900) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to high number of microtransaction types with high required quantities!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

#### Invariant 2 Implementation

```cpp
void check_special_offers_ratio(int n, int m) {
    if (m < n / 2) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to sparse special offers!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

#### Invariant 3 Implementation

```cpp
void check_concentration_of_microtransactions(const vector<int>& k) {
    int max_k = *max_element(k.begin(), k.end());
    if (max_k > 500) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to high concentration of required microtransactions on a few types!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrate Checks into the Original Program

Now, we'll integrate these check implementations into the original C++ program. The goal is to insert them at effective points in the code without adding overhead to tight loops.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
using lint = long long;
template <class T = int>
using V = vector<T>;
template <class T = int>
using VV = V<V<T>>;

// Check for performance bottleneck due to high number of microtransaction types with high required quantities
void check_microtransaction_structure(int n, const vector<int>& k) {
    int total_microtransactions = accumulate(k.begin(), k.end(), 0);
    if (n > 900 && total_microtransactions > 900) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to high number of microtransaction types with high required quantities!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Check for performance bottleneck due to sparse special offers
void check_special_offers_ratio(int n, int m) {
    if (m < n / 2) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to sparse special offers!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Check for performance bottleneck due to high concentration of required microtransactions on a few types
void check_concentration_of_microtransactions(const vector<int>& k) {
    int max_k = *max_element(k.begin(), k.end());
    if (max_k > 500) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to high concentration of required microtransactions on a few types!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    cin.tie(nullptr);
    ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
    int n, m;
    cin >> n >> m;
    
    V<> k(n);
    for (auto&& e : k) cin >> e;
    
    // Insert performance checkers
    check_microtransaction_structure(n, k);
    check_special_offers_ratio(n, m);
    check_concentration_of_microtransactions(k);
    
    VV<> a(n);
    while (m--) {
        int d, t;
        cin >> d >> t, --d, --t;
        a[t].push_back(d);
    }
    
    for (auto&& v : a) sort(begin(v), end(v));
    
    auto chk = [&](int x) -> bool {
        VV<> v(4e5);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            int j = lower_bound(begin(a[i]), end(a[i]), x) - begin(a[i]) - 1;
            if (j < 0) continue;
            v[a[i][j]].push_back(i);
        }
        int c = 0;
        auto r = k;
        int y = 0;
        for (int j = 0; j < x; ++j) {
            ++c;
            for (int i : v[j]) {
                int t = min(c, r[i]);
                r[i] -= t;
                c -= t;
                y += t;
            }
        }
        return x + y >= 2 * accumulate(begin(k), end(k), 0);
    };
    
    int ng = 0, ok = 2 * accumulate(begin(k), end(k), 0);
    while (ok - ng > 1) {
        int mid = ng + ok >> 1;
        (chk(mid) ? ok : ng) = mid;
    }
    
    cout << ok << '\n';
}
```

### Explanation

- **Place of Checker Insertion:** The checks are placed immediately after reading the input, ensuring the program assesses potential bottlenecks based on initial conditions before proceeding with computations.
- **Avoid Overhead in Loops:** The checks are outside of any loops that process microtransactions, thereby avoiding additional runtime overhead.
- **Utility for Fuzzers:** These checks help identify scenarios where the program is more prone to slow execution, making them valuable for fuzzing and testing.
