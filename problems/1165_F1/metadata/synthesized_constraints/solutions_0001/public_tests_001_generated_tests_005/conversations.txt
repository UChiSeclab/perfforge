system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

The only difference between easy and hard versions is constraints.

Ivan plays a computer game that contains some microtransactions to make characters look cooler. Since Ivan wants his character to be really cool, he wants to use some of these microtransactions — and he won't start playing until he gets all of them.

Each day (during the morning) Ivan earns exactly one burle.

There are n types of microtransactions in the game. Each microtransaction costs 2 burles usually and 1 burle if it is on sale. Ivan has to order exactly k_i microtransactions of the i-th type (he orders microtransactions during the evening).

Ivan can order any (possibly zero) number of microtransactions of any types during any day (of course, if he has enough money to do it). If the microtransaction he wants to order is on sale then he can buy it for 1 burle and otherwise he can buy it for 2 burles.

There are also m special offers in the game shop. The j-th offer (d_j, t_j) means that microtransactions of the t_j-th type are on sale during the d_j-th day.

Ivan wants to order all microtransactions as soon as possible. Your task is to calculate the minimum day when he can buy all microtransactions he want and actually start playing.

Input

The first line of the input contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000) — the number of types of microtransactions and the number of special offers in the game shop.

The second line of the input contains n integers k_1, k_2, ..., k_n (0 ≤ k_i ≤ 1000), where k_i is the number of copies of microtransaction of the i-th type Ivan has to order. It is guaranteed that sum of all k_i is not less than 1 and not greater than 1000.

The next m lines contain special offers. The j-th of these lines contains the j-th special offer. It is given as a pair of integers (d_j, t_j) (1 ≤ d_j ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ t_j ≤ n) and means that microtransactions of the t_j-th type are on sale during the d_j-th day.

Output

Print one integer — the minimum day when Ivan can order all microtransactions he wants and actually start playing.

assistant: ### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

Based on the hit counts, the following observations can be made:

1. **Loop in `check` function**: The loop on line 21 (`for (int j = 1; j <= i; j++)`) is a major hotspot. It executes significantly more times for the slow input compared to the fast input (95 versus 62 hits). This loop is critical because it directly depends on the value of `i`, which in turn depends on the binary search for the minimum day.

2. **`check` function calls**: The `check` function is called more often in the slow case (5 times) than in the fast case (4 times). This indicates that the binary search in `solve` iterates more on the slow input.

3. **`for` loop inside `check` function**: The loop on line 16 that populates `days_cnts` is also more frequently executed for the slow input (30 versus 24 hits). This loop iterates over the number of transaction types, `n`.

4. **Conditional check in `check`**: The condition on line 12 (`if (offers[j].first > i) continue;`) is checked but does not seem to be the main bottleneck, as its hit count matches the for-loop iteration.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **High Days Count for Sales Offers**:
   - Natural Language Invariant: "When the number of days over which special offers are available is large relative to the cost requirements, the binary search may lead to increased iterations, inflating the execution time."
   - This is because a higher `i` (day count) in `check` results in more iterations of the loop on line 21.

2. **Sparse Special Offers**:
   - Natural Language Invariant: "If special offers are sparse or poorly aligned with the days when purchases need to optimize balance, the program may require more iterations to find the minimum day when all purchases can be made."
   - Sparse offers can lead to more `check` calls during binary search as it struggles to find a suitable day.

3. **High Transaction Type Requirements**:
   - Natural Language Invariant: "When the required amount of each microtransaction type approaches the upper threshold and is unevenly distributed across days, the balance calculation becomes less efficient, slowing down the process."
   - This is reflected by more hits on lines 16-17 and 21-25 in the `check` function.

4. **Binary Search Depth**:
   - Natural Language Invariant: "The greater the sum of required microtransactions (`sum_k`), the deeper the binary search may go to find the minimum day, leading to more frequent calls to the check function."
   - The binary search is influenced by `sum_k`, impacting lines 48-53 in `solve`.

These invariants give insight into the conditions under which performance deteriorates and guide potential optimizations, such as improving the handling of special offers or optimizing the balance-checking loop.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
The only difference between easy and hard versions is constraints.

Ivan plays a computer game that contains some microtransactions to make characters look cooler. Since Ivan wants his character to be really cool, he wants to use some of these microtransactions — and he won't start playing until he gets all of them.

Each day (during the morning) Ivan earns exactly one burle.

There are n types of microtransactions in the game. Each microtransaction costs 2 burles usually and 1 burle if it is on sale. Ivan has to order exactly k_i microtransactions of the i-th type (he orders microtransactions during the evening).

Ivan can order any (possibly zero) number of microtransactions of any types during any day (of course, if he has enough money to do it). If the microtransaction he wants to order is on sale then he can buy it for 1 burle and otherwise he can buy it for 2 burles.

There are also m special offers in the game shop. The j-th offer (d_j, t_j) means that microtransactions of the t_j-th type are on sale during the d_j-th day.

Ivan wants to order all microtransactions as soon as possible. Your task is to calculate the minimum day when he can buy all microtransactions he want and actually start playing.

Input

The first line of the input contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000) — the number of types of microtransactions and the number of special offers in the game shop.

The second line of the input contains n integers k_1, k_2, ..., k_n (0 ≤ k_i ≤ 1000), where k_i is the number of copies of microtransaction of the i-th type Ivan has to order. It is guaranteed that sum of all k_i is not less than 1 and not greater than 1000.

The next m lines contain special offers. The j-th of these lines contains the j-th special offer. It is given as a pair of integers (d_j, t_j) (1 ≤ d_j ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ t_j ≤ n) and means that microtransactions of the t_j-th type are on sale during the d_j-th day.

Output

Print one integer — the minimum day when Ivan can order all microtransactions he wants and actually start playing.

assistant: ### Phase 3: Implementing Invariants as C++ Runtime Checks

Below are the implementations of the previously defined performance-characterizing invariants as runtime checks in C++:

```cpp
// Check for high day count for sales offers
void check_high_days_count_invariant(int days_offers_count, int sum_k) {
    if (days_offers_count > 2 * sum_k) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive days with offers!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Check for sparse special offers
void check_sparse_offers_invariant(int m, int n) {
    if (m < n / 2) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - sparse special offers!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Check for high transaction type requirements
void check_high_transaction_invariant(int max_k) {
    if (max_k > 800) { // Assuming a threshold close to the upper constraint of 1000
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high transaction type requirement!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Check for binary search depth (indirectly based on sum_k)
void check_binary_search_depth(int left, int right) {
    if (right - left > 500) {  // Arbitrarily chosen threshold
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive binary search depth!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrating Checks with Original C++ Program

Below is the instrumented version of the original C++ code, with the runtime checks integrated:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
const int maxn = 600005;
const long long mod = 998244353;
int n, m;
vector<int> k;
vector<pair<int, int>> offers;
long long sum_k;

// Check for high day count for sales offers
void check_high_days_count_invariant(int days_offers_count, int sum_k) {
    if (days_offers_count > 2 * sum_k) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive days with offers!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Check for sparse special offers
void check_sparse_offers_invariant(int m, int n) {
    if (m < n / 2) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - sparse special offers!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Check for high transaction type requirements
void check_high_transaction_invariant(int max_k) {
    if (max_k > 800) { // Assuming a threshold close to the upper constraint of 1000
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high transaction type requirement!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Check for binary search depth (indirectly based on sum_k)
void check_binary_search_depth(int left, int right) {
    if (right - left > 500) {  // Arbitrarily chosen threshold
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive binary search depth!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

bool check(int i) {
    vector<int> offers_days(maxn + 5, 0);
    for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
        if (offers[j].first > i) continue;
        offers_days[offers[j].second] = offers[j].first;
    }
    vector<int> days_cnts(maxn + 5, 0);
    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        days_cnts[offers_days[j]] += k[j];
    }
    int balance = 0;
    int optimized = 0;
    for (int j = 1; j <= i; j++) {
        balance++;
        int delta = min(days_cnts[j], balance);
        balance -= delta;
        optimized += delta;
    }
    int left = sum_k - optimized;
    return left * 2 <= balance;
}

void solve() {
    cin >> n >> m;
    k.resize(n);
    sum_k = 0;
    int max_k = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        cin >> k[i];
        sum_k += k[i];
        max_k = max(max_k, k[i]);
    }
    
    offers.resize(m);
    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        cin >> offers[i].first >> offers[i].second;
        offers[i].second--;
    }
    sort(offers.begin(), offers.end());
    
    // Insert checks based on the derived invariants
    check_high_days_count_invariant(m, sum_k);
    check_sparse_offers_invariant(m, n);
    check_high_transaction_invariant(max_k);
    
    int sum = 0;
    int max_days = sum_k * 2;
    int l = 0;
    int r = max_days;
    
    while (l < r - 1) {
        int m = (l + r) / 2;
        if (check(m)) {
            r = m;
        } else {
            l = m;
        }
        
        check_binary_search_depth(l, r);
    }
    cout << r;
}

int main() {
    cin.tie(0);
    cout.tie(0);
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    solve();
    return 0;
}
```

**Comments**:
- Each check is implemented and placed outside of the tight loops to prevent performance degradation.
- Checks for invariants related to sales offers and transaction types are placed after input processing.
- The binary search depth check is done within the loop but outside of performance-critical sections.
