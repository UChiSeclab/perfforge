system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

The only difference between easy and hard versions is constraints.

The BerTV channel every day broadcasts one episode of one of the k TV shows. You know the schedule for the next n days: a sequence of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ k), where a_i is the show, the episode of which will be shown in i-th day.

The subscription to the show is bought for the entire show (i.e. for all its episodes), for each show the subscription is bought separately.

How many minimum subscriptions do you need to buy in order to have the opportunity to watch episodes of purchased shows d (1 ≤ d ≤ n) days in a row? In other words, you want to buy the minimum number of TV shows so that there is some segment of d consecutive days in which all episodes belong to the purchased shows.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) — the number of test cases in the input. Then t test case descriptions follow.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n, k and d (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ k ≤ 100, 1 ≤ d ≤ n). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ k), where a_i is the show that is broadcasted on the i-th day.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values ​​of n for all test cases in the input does not exceed 100.

Output

Print t integers — the answers to the test cases in the input in the order they follow. The answer to a test case is the minimum number of TV shows for which you need to purchase a subscription so that you can watch episodes of the purchased TV shows on BerTV for d consecutive days. Please note that it is permissible that you will be able to watch more than d days in a row.

Note

In the first test case to have an opportunity to watch shows for two consecutive days, you need to buy a subscription on show 1 and on show 2. So the answer is two.

In the second test case, you can buy a subscription to any show because for each show you can find a segment of three consecutive days, consisting only of episodes of this show.

In the third test case in the unique segment of four days, you have four different shows, so you need to buy a subscription to all these four shows.

In the fourth test case, you can buy subscriptions to shows 3,5,7,8,9, and you will be able to watch shows for the last eight days.

assistant: To diagnose the performance bottleneck in the provided C code, we will first analyze the hit counts associated with the slow and fast inputs. Then, we'll derive performance-characterizing invariants in natural language based on these observations.

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Line-Level Hit Count Analysis:**
   - Lines 19-22 are executed significantly more times in the slow input compared to the fast input. Specifically, the loop at line 19 runs 6426 times for the slow input versus 2142 times for the fast input.
   - The conditional block within this loop (lines 20-22) also has higher hit counts in the slow input. These lines are responsible for counting and resetting elements in the `temp` array.

2. **Inference:**
   - The nested loop at lines 19-22 iterates over a fixed range (up to 100), corresponding to the maximum possible number of different TV shows (`k`, as each show from 1 to k can appear).
   - The loop processes each element in the `temp` array to count how many different shows are present. The high hit count indicates that the `temp` array frequently contains non-zero values, causing the `if` condition to trigger often, resulting in many increments of `count` and resets of `temp[k]`.

3. **Interaction with Input Constraints:**
   - The outer loop at line 15 iterates for each starting day of a d-length segment of the schedule. If `d` is small relative to `n`, more segments need processing, increasing the outer loop's iterations.
   - The inner `j` loop (lines 16-17) increments hit counts based on shows present in a d-length segment, affecting how often `temp` requires resetting.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Given the observations, the code slows down under certain conditions which can be abstracted into the following performance-characterizing invariants:

1. **High Variety in Short Segments:**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "When the number of distinct shows in every d-day segment is high relative to d, the program may perform excessive counting operations, leading to slower execution."
   - **Condition:** If the variety of shows in segments increases, the loop executes more checks and resets, which cumulatively increase processing time.

2. **Small `d` Relative to `n`:**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "If the number of days `d` is small compared to the total number of days `n`, the program processes more segments, increasing the number of operations on the `temp` array."
   - **Condition:** A smaller `d` implies a larger number of overlapping segments. Processing each requires iterating over potentially many unique shows, increasing the load on the inner loops.

3. **Frequent Non-Zero Entries in `temp`:**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "When the `temp` array consistently contains several non-zero elements, indicating a high number of distinct shows in segments, the program incurs additional overhead in resetting these counts."
   - **Condition:** High distinct count for each segment results in many increments and resets of `temp`, as more shows need tracking.

These invariants describe the interplay between the variety of shows in the segments and how the program's design interacts with those input patterns, leading to slower execution under certain conditions. By abstracting the conditions triggering slowdowns, these invariants are designed to help identify future slow scenarios without relying on specific numeric input values.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
The only difference between easy and hard versions is constraints.

The BerTV channel every day broadcasts one episode of one of the k TV shows. You know the schedule for the next n days: a sequence of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ k), where a_i is the show, the episode of which will be shown in i-th day.

The subscription to the show is bought for the entire show (i.e. for all its episodes), for each show the subscription is bought separately.

How many minimum subscriptions do you need to buy in order to have the opportunity to watch episodes of purchased shows d (1 ≤ d ≤ n) days in a row? In other words, you want to buy the minimum number of TV shows so that there is some segment of d consecutive days in which all episodes belong to the purchased shows.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) — the number of test cases in the input. Then t test case descriptions follow.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n, k and d (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ k ≤ 100, 1 ≤ d ≤ n). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ k), where a_i is the show that is broadcasted on the i-th day.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values ​​of n for all test cases in the input does not exceed 100.

Output

Print t integers — the answers to the test cases in the input in the order they follow. The answer to a test case is the minimum number of TV shows for which you need to purchase a subscription so that you can watch episodes of the purchased TV shows on BerTV for d consecutive days. Please note that it is permissible that you will be able to watch more than d days in a row.

Example

Input

3 3 3 2 2 2 1 1 1
4 10 4

16 9 8
3 1 4 1 5 9 2 6 5 3 5 8 9 7 9 3


Output

Note

In the first test case to have an opportunity to watch shows for two consecutive days, you need to buy a subscription on show 1 and on show 2. So the answer is two.

In the second test case, you can buy a subscription to any show because for each show you can find a segment of three consecutive days, consisting only of episodes of this show.

In the third test case in the unique segment of four days, you have four different shows, so you need to buy a subscription to all these four shows.

In the fourth test case, you can buy subscriptions to shows 3,5,7,8,9, and you will be able to watch shows for the last eight days.

Solution (C++ code):
{solution}


assistant: ### Phase 3: Implementing Invariants as C++ Code

Here, I'll transform the natural language performance-characterizing invariants into C++ code that can be integrated into the program to check for these conditions at runtime. 

#### Invariant 1: High Variety in Short Segments

```cpp
void check_high_variety_in_short_segments(int distinctShowCount, int d) {
    // This condition checks if distinct shows in a segment are high relative to d.
    if (distinctShowCount > d) {
        cerr << "Warning: High variety of shows in a short segment detected!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

#### Invariant 2: Small `d` Relative to `n`

```cpp
void check_small_d_relative_to_n(int n, int d) {
    // This condition checks if d is significantly smaller than n.
    if (d < n / 10) {  // Assuming d being less than 10% of n is a potential inefficiency point.
        cerr << "Warning: Small 'd' relative to 'n' detected, causing inefficient segment processing!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

#### Invariant 3: Frequent Non-Zero Entries in `temp`

```cpp
void check_frequent_non_zero_entries(int nonZeroCount, int threshold) {
    // This condition checks if there are frequent non-zero entries indicating many different shows.
    if (nonZeroCount > threshold) {
        cerr << "Warning: Frequent non-zero entries in 'temp' detected, indicating high variety!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrating Checks into the Original Program

Next, I'll integrate these checks into the given C++ program at appropriate locations to detect and abort on potential performance issues.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Checker functions
void check_high_variety_in_short_segments(int distinctShowCount, int d) {
    if (distinctShowCount > d) {
        cerr << "Warning: High variety of shows in a short segment detected!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_small_d_relative_to_n(int n, int d) {
    if (d < n / 10) {
        cerr << "Warning: Small 'd' relative to 'n' detected, causing inefficient segment processing!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_frequent_non_zero_entries(int nonZeroCount, int threshold) {
    if (nonZeroCount > threshold) {
        cerr << "Warning: Frequent non-zero entries in 'temp' detected, indicating high variety!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    int n, k, d;
    cin >> n >> k >> d;
    int arr[n];
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      cin >> arr[i];
    }

    // Check if 'd' is considerably smaller than 'n'
    check_small_d_relative_to_n(n, d);
    
    int temp[101] = {0};
    int max_day = INT_MAX, count = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i + d <= n; i++) {
      for (int j = i; j < d + i; j++) {
        temp[arr[j]]++;
      }
      
      int nonZeroCount = 0;
      for (int k = 0; k <= 100; k++) {
        if (temp[k] != 0) {
          count++;
          nonZeroCount++;
          temp[k] = 0;
        }
      }
      
      // Check for high variety in short segments
      check_high_variety_in_short_segments(count, d);

      // Check for frequent non-zero entries
      check_frequent_non_zero_entries(nonZeroCount, 20); // Assume 20 is a threshold for high variety

      max_day = min(max_day, count);
      count = 0;
    }
    cout << max_day << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of Integration:

1. **Placement of Checks:**
   - **`check_small_d_relative_to_n`** is called early after reading `n`, `k`, and `d` to ensure that the condition is verified before heavy processing begins.
   - **`check_high_variety_in_short_segments`** and **`check_frequent_non_zero_entries`** are placed inside the loop after counting distinct shows and before resetting `temp`. This ensures we check the condition where `temp` has been used to count distinct elements and reset.

2. **Thresholds:**
   - The thresholds in the conditions are set based on reasonable assumptions about what constitutes a "slow path" for given constraints (`n <= 100`).

3. **Purpose:**
   - These checks help in identifying and aborting potential performance bottlenecks during runtime, assisting in debugging and optimization processes.
