=== Invariants Response ===
To diagnose the performance bottleneck in the given C program, let's break down the problem and analyze the provided hit counts.

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Line-Level Hit Count Comparison**:
   - **Line 14**: `for (int i = 0; i <= 1000000; i++) kol[i] = 0;` shows a massive difference in hit counts between the slow and fast inputs. The slow input has `10,000,020` hits, whereas the fast input has `1,000,002` hits.
   - **Line 22-27 (Sliding window loop)**: The loop's execution is significantly more frequent in the slow input (`33` hits) compared to the fast input (`1` hit).
   
2. **Inference**:
   - The line initializing the `kol` array is executed for each test case, regardless of the size of `n` or `d`. Given the constraints, the initialization of a very large array is inefficient because the array is much larger than needed (since `n <= 100`).
   - The loop from `line 22` is indicative of a sliding window mechanism that is recalculating the unique elements in each window of size `d`. The slow input likely triggers this loop more due to smaller values of `d`, leading to more iterations.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

#### Invariant 1: Initialization Overhead
- **Natural Language Description**: "If the total number of test cases is high, the unnecessary repeated initialization of a large array (`kol`) significantly increases overhead. Instead of initializing up to `1,000,000`, using a smaller size proportionate to `k` could alleviate the issue."
- **Implementation Suggestion**: Limit the initialization of `kol` to `k + 1` instead of `1,000,001`. This adjustment would reduce the initialization overhead considerably.

#### Invariant 2: Sliding Window Execution
- **Natural Language Description**: "If the window size `d` is much smaller than `n`, the program may enter a slow path due to repeated recalculation of unique show subscriptions for every possible window. This becomes expensive as `d` gets smaller relative to `n`."
- **Implementation Suggestion**: Optimize the sliding window operation to recognize and handle uniform segments or minimal changes more efficiently.

### Summary

- The code slows down primarily due to two factors: inefficient initialization of a large array and the costly repeated calculations in the sliding window logic, especially when `d` is small compared to `n`.
- By adjusting the unnecessary initialization size and optimizing the sliding window recalculation, the program should handle slow scenarios more efficiently while adhering to given constraints.

=== Checker Response ===
## Phase 3: Implementing the Natural Language Invariants in C++

Here, I will transform the natural language invariants derived in Phase 2 into C++ code snippets to check these conditions at runtime.

### Invariant 1: Initialization Overhead
```cpp
void check_initialization_invariant(int kol_size, int k) {
    if (kol_size > k + 1) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - unnecessary large initialization of kol array!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Invariant 2: Sliding Window Execution
```cpp
void check_sliding_window_invariant(int n, int d) {
    if (d < n / 2) { // Arbitrarily considering d < n/2 as a threshold for inefficient execution
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - repeated recalculations due to small d!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

## Phase 4: Integrating the Checkers into the Original Program

Here, I'll integrate the checker functions into the provided C++ code to detect performance bottlenecks.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
const int N = 1e6 + 6;
int a[N], kol[N], del, k, d, n;

void check_initialization_invariant(int kol_size, int k) {
    if (kol_size > k + 1) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - unnecessary large initialization of kol array!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_sliding_window_invariant(int n, int d) {
    if (d < n / 2) { // Arbitrarily considering d < n/2 as a threshold for inefficient execution
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - repeated recalculations due to small d!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

signed main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
    cin.tie(0);
    cout.tie(0);
    int t;
    cin >> t;
    for (int u = 0; u < t; u++) {
        cin >> n >> k >> d;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) cin >> a[i];

        // Check for initialization overhead
        check_initialization_invariant(1000000, k);

        for (int i = 0; i <= 1000000; i++) kol[i] = 0;

        del = 0;
        int ans = n;

        // Check for sliding window execution inefficiency
        check_sliding_window_invariant(n, d);

        for (int i = 1; i <= d; i++) {
            kol[a[i]]++;
            if (kol[a[i]] == 1) del++;
        }
        ans = del;
        for (int i = d + 1; i <= n; i++) {
            kol[a[i - d]]--;
            if (kol[a[i - d]] == 0) del--;
            kol[a[i]]++;
            if (kol[a[i]] == 1) del++;
            ans = min(ans, del);
        }
        cout << ans << "\n";
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

- **Initialization Invariant**: The check is done right after reading `k` to ensure the `kol` array is not unnecessarily large. Adjustments could be made to initialize only the required part based on `k`.
- **Sliding Window Invariant**: The check is performed right before the sliding window logic begins. If `d` is found to be inefficiently small, it will abort the program, prompting an investigation into input values or algorithm modification.
