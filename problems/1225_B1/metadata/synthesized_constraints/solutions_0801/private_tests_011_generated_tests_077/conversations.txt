system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

The only difference between easy and hard versions is constraints.

The BerTV channel every day broadcasts one episode of one of the k TV shows. You know the schedule for the next n days: a sequence of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ k), where a_i is the show, the episode of which will be shown in i-th day.

The subscription to the show is bought for the entire show (i.e. for all its episodes), for each show the subscription is bought separately.

How many minimum subscriptions do you need to buy in order to have the opportunity to watch episodes of purchased shows d (1 ≤ d ≤ n) days in a row? In other words, you want to buy the minimum number of TV shows so that there is some segment of d consecutive days in which all episodes belong to the purchased shows.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) — the number of test cases in the input. Then t test case descriptions follow.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n, k and d (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ k ≤ 100, 1 ≤ d ≤ n). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ k), where a_i is the show that is broadcasted on the i-th day.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values ​​of n for all test cases in the input does not exceed 100.

Output

Print t integers — the answers to the test cases in the input in the order they follow. The answer to a test case is the minimum number of TV shows for which you need to purchase a subscription so that you can watch episodes of the purchased TV shows on BerTV for d consecutive days. Please note that it is permissible that you will be able to watch more than d days in a row.

Output

Note

In the first test case to have an opportunity to watch shows for two consecutive days, you need to buy a subscription on show 1 and on show 2. So the answer is two.

In the second test case, you can buy a subscription to any show because for each show you can find a segment of three consecutive days, consisting only of episodes of this show.

In the third test case in the unique segment of four days, you have four different shows, so you need to buy a subscription to all these four shows.

In the fourth test case, you can buy subscriptions to shows 3,5,7,8,9, and you will be able to watch shows for the last eight days.

assistant: To analyze the performance characteristics of this C program, let's follow the steps outlined and derive performance-characterizing invariants based on the hit counts and understanding of the code.

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Hit Count Comparison**: 
   - The `while (t--)` loop (line 8) is hit 11 times in the slow input and only 2 times in the fast input.
   - The initialization and processing of the `used` vector (lines 15-34) are much more frequently hit in the slow input compared to the fast input.
   - Notably, the second loop `for (int i = d; i < n; i++)` (line 25) executes 33 times for the slow input but only once for the fast input.

2. **Pinpointing Lines/Functions**: 
   - Lines 25-34 have significantly more hits in the slow input suggesting they are critical to the slowdown.
   - The operations on the `used` vector (lines 19, 22, 26, 29, 30, and 33) are indicative of frequent data structure accesses/manipulations which are potentially expensive.

3. **Data Structures, Loops, Recursion**: 
   - The `used` vector is a large array initialized and accessed heavily. It interacts with the loops over `d` and `n`.
   - The inefficiency might be due to the large range of indices (`2000005`) and repeated updates which could slow down execution.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Here are natural language statements that capture the conditions under which the program runs slowly:

1. **Vector Size and Loop Interactions**:
   - **Invariant**: "If the number of unique TV shows (k) approaches n, and the window size d is large compared to the total days n, frequent updates to the large `used` vector may cause significant slowdowns."
   - **Explanation**: When the program needs to analyze a large number of shows `k` within a large day window `d`, it leads to high iteration counts and updates in `used`, making the process costly.

2. **Sliding Window Mechanics**:
   - **Invariant**: "If d is large relative to n and many unique shows appear frequently, the sliding window requires repeated adjustments to the `used` vector which can degrade performance."
   - **Explanation**: Larger `d` values increase the number of times the sliding window logic iterates over elements, leading to repeated vector updates and checks.

3. **Sparse Show Appearance**:
   - **Invariant**: "When shows are spread such that the sliding window repeatedly initializes and finalizes subscriptions, the overhead can increase, especially as the difference between k and d narrows."
   - **Explanation**: The efficiency decreases when most of the shows appear intermittently, making the sliding window re-evaluate and adjust vector states frequently.

These invariants are designed to encompass various scenarios where the algorithm's logic for managing TV show subscriptions and sliding windows might slow down, providing an abstract understanding without relying on specific numeric values from the input.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
The only difference between easy and hard versions is constraints.

The BerTV channel every day broadcasts one episode of one of the k TV shows. You know the schedule for the next n days: a sequence of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ k), where a_i is the show, the episode of which will be shown in i-th day.

The subscription to the show is bought for the entire show (i.e. for all its episodes), for each show the subscription is bought separately.

How many minimum subscriptions do you need to buy in order to have the opportunity to watch episodes of purchased shows d (1 ≤ d ≤ n) days in a row? In other words, you want to buy the minimum number of TV shows so that there is some segment of d consecutive days in which all episodes belong to the purchased shows.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) — the number of test cases in the input. Then t test case descriptions follow.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n, k and d (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ k ≤ 100, 1 ≤ d ≤ n). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ k), where a_i is the show that is broadcasted on the i-th day.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values ​​of n for all test cases in the input does not exceed 100.

Output

Print t integers — the answers to the test cases in the input in the order they follow. The answer to a test case is the minimum number of TV shows for which you need to purchase a subscription so that you can watch episodes of the purchased TV shows on BerTV for d consecutive days. Please note that it is permissible that you will be able to watch more than d days in a row.

Example

Input


4
5 2 2
1 2 1 2 1
9 3 3
3 3 3 2 2 2 1 1 1
4 10 4
10 8 6 4
16 9 8
3 1 4 1 5 9 2 6 5 3 5 8 9 7 9 3


Output


2
1
4
5

Note

In the first test case to have an opportunity to watch shows for two consecutive days, you need to buy a subscription on show 1 and on show 2. So the answer is two.

In the second test case, you can buy a subscription to any show because for each show you can find a segment of three consecutive days, consisting only of episodes of this show.

In the third test case in the unique segment of four days, you have four different shows, so you need to buy a subscription to all these four shows.

In the fourth test case, you can buy subscriptions to shows 3,5,7,8,9, and you will be able to watch shows for the last eight days.

Solution (C++ code):
{solution}


assistant: ### Phase 3: Implement the Natural Language Invariants in C++

To implement the invariants derived from Phase 2, we write C++ checker functions that will be used to detect performance bottlenecks. Here are the implementations for the conditions described in the natural language:

1. **Invariant for Vector Size and Loop Interactions**:
   ```cpp
   void check_vector_size_and_window_interaction(int n, int k, int d) {
       if (d > n / 2 && k > n / 2) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large d and k relative to n causing frequent updates to 'used' vector." << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Invariant for Sliding Window Mechanics**:
   ```cpp
   void check_sliding_window_mechanics(int n, int d) {
       if (d > n / 2) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large window size d relative to n." << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Invariant for Sparse Show Appearance**:
   ```cpp
   void check_sparse_show_appearance(int k, int d) {
       if (k - d < 5) { // Arbitrary threshold for sparseness
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - frequent reevaluation due to sparse shows." << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Integrate Checkers Into the Original C++ Program

Now we integrate the above checker functions into the original program. We ensure they are placed at points where they won't add overhead to tight loops, typically before entering the main logic of each test case.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Checker functions
void check_vector_size_and_window_interaction(int n, int k, int d) {
    if (d > n / 2 && k > n / 2) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large d and k relative to n causing frequent updates to 'used' vector." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_sliding_window_mechanics(int n, int d) {
    if (d > n / 2) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large window size d relative to n." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_sparse_show_appearance(int k, int d) {
    if (k - d < 5) { // Arbitrary threshold for sparseness
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - frequent reevaluation due to sparse shows." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(nullptr);
    int t;
    cin >> t;
    while (t--) {
        int n, k, d;
        cin >> n >> k >> d;
        vector<int> a(n);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            cin >> a[i];
        }

        // Insert checks based on derived invariants
        check_vector_size_and_window_interaction(n, k, d);
        check_sliding_window_mechanics(n, d);
        check_sparse_show_appearance(k, d);

        vector<int> used(2000005, 0);
        int res = k;
        int cur = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < d; i++) {
            if (!used[a[i]]) {
                cur++;
            }
            used[a[i]]++;
        }
        res = min(cur, res);
        for (int i = d; i < n; i++) {
            if (!used[a[i]]) {
                cur++;
            }
            used[a[i]]++;
            if (used[a[i - d]] == 1) {
                cur--;
            }
            used[a[i - d]]--;
            res = min(res, cur);
        }
        cout << res << endl;
    }
}
```

### Notes:
- **Placement of Checkers**: The checkers are inserted before the main logic for each test case, ensuring they don't interfere with the main data processing inside loops.
- **Thresholds**: The chosen thresholds (like `n / 2` and `5`) are arbitrary but should be tuned based on more in-depth performance profiling if needed.
- **Efficiency**: These checks are intended for debugging and performance tuning; they should be removed or disabled in production builds.
