=== Invariants Response ===
To analyze the given C code and identify performance-characterizing invariants, we will follow the outlined phases and tasks.

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

**Analysis of Hit Counts:**
1. The function `get` (lines 7-35) is called extensively, with particularly high hit counts for the slow input compared to the fast input. For instance, line 7 is hit 54,117 times for the slow input versus 114 times for the fast.
2. Lines within `get` that are hit significantly more in the slow run include the recursive call on line 19 and the checks on lines 16, 17, and 18.
3. The nested loop on line 45-49 and the recursive nature of `get` suggest that the slowdown may be related to excessive recursive calls, especially with larger values of `sum`.

**Key Observations:**
- The recursive calls in `get` are likely causing a large number of computations, especially when `sum` is large.
- The hit counts indicate a high level of recursion and redundancy in calculations, particularly when trying to find combinations of digits summing to `s`.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the analysis, here are some natural language performance invariants that describe conditions under which the program may enter a slow path:

1. **High Sum Combinations:**
   - "When the sum of digits `s` is large relative to the number of digits `m`, the recursive search space significantly increases, leading to repeated calculations and potential slowdown."
   - This is because a large `s` requires exploring many combinations of digits to satisfy the sum, increasing recursive calls.

2. **Recursive Depth and Redundancy:**
   - "If the sum of digits `s` approaches the upper limit of its range, the recursive function `get` explores a vast space of digit combinations, causing redundant computations and slowing down the program."
   - This invariant reflects high recursion levels due to attempting to fit a large sum within a limited number of digits.

3. **Digit Limitations:**
   - "When the number of digits `m` is fixed and the sum `s` is disproportionately high, the constraint of no leading zeroes forces more complex digit arrangements, increasing computational overhead."
   - The invariant captures how constraints affect the complexity of finding valid digit combinations.

These performance invariants reflect broad conditions likely to trigger slow execution paths, such as when `s` is high relative to `m`, requiring extensive recursive exploration. They avoid specific input values, focus on structural issues, and consider the input constraints.

### Phase 3: Implement Performance-Characterizing Invariants as C++ Checkers

Based on the natural language invariants derived earlier, let's implement them as runtime checks in C++.

#### Invariant 1: High Sum Combinations
```cpp
void check_high_sum_combination(int m, int s) {
    if (s > m * 9) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - sum too high for digit count!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

#### Invariant 2: Recursive Depth and Redundancy
```cpp
void check_recursive_depth(int m, int s) {
    if (s > 800 && m < 20) { // Example threshold; adjust as per domain knowledge
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high recursive depth due to large sum!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

#### Invariant 3: Digit Limitations
```cpp
void check_digit_limitations(int m, int s) {
    if (m == 1 && s == 0) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - impossible configuration!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrate Checkers into the Original Program

Now, integrate these checkers into the given C++ program at suitable points.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
using lint = long long;
vector<vector<bool>> dp;
vector<string> result(2);
int n, sum;

// Checker functions
void check_high_sum_combination(int m, int s) {
    if (s > m * 9) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - sum too high for digit count!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_recursive_depth(int m, int s) {
    if (s > 800 && m < 20) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high recursive depth due to large sum!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_digit_limitations(int m, int s) {
    if (m == 1 && s == 0) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - impossible configuration!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int get(int idx, int sum, int maximum, int done = 1) {
    if (idx == 0) return (sum ? 0 : 1);
    if (done) return dp[idx][sum];
    int works = 0;
    int cur;
    if (maximum)
        cur = INT_MIN;
    else
        cur = INT_MAX;
    for (int i = 0; i <= 9; ++i) {
        if (sum - i >= 0)
            if (idx != n || i) {
                works |= get(idx - 1, sum - i, -1);
                if (works) {
                    if (maximum)
                        cur = max(cur, i);
                    else
                        cur = min(cur, i);
                }
            }
    }
    if (maximum == 1) {
        result[maximum].push_back(cur + '0');
        return get(idx - 1, sum - cur, 1, 0);
    } else if (maximum == 0) {
        result[maximum].push_back(cur + '0');
        return get(idx - 1, sum - cur, 0, 0);
    }
    return dp[idx][sum] = works;
}

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0), cin.tie(0), cout.tie(0);
    cin >> n >> sum;

    // Insert checkers after input is read
    check_high_sum_combination(n, sum);
    check_recursive_depth(n, sum);
    check_digit_limitations(n, sum);

    dp = vector<vector<bool>>(n + 1, vector<bool>(sum + 1, false));
    if (n == 1 && sum == 0) {
        cout << "0 0\n";
        exit(0);
    }
    for (int i = 0; i <= n; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j <= sum; ++j) {
            get(i, j, -1, 0);
        }
    }
    if (get(n, sum, -1) == 0) {
        cout << "-1 -1\n";
        exit(0);
    }
    get(n, sum, 1, 0);
    get(n, sum, 0, 0);
    for (int i = 0; i < 2; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < result[i].size(); ++j) cout << result[i][j];
        if (i == 0)
            cout << ' ';
        else
            cout << '\n';
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**
- Each checker function is placed after reading the input but before any significant computation occurs, ensuring the program aborts early if a performance bottleneck condition is detected.
- The conditions in each checker reflect the natural language invariants and attempt to identify potential performance issues based on input characteristics.
