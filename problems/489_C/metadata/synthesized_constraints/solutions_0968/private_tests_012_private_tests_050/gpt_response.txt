=== Invariants Response ===
To identify performance bottlenecks and derive performance-characterizing invariants, let's analyze the given C program and hit count information.

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Comparison of Hit Counts**:
   - The function `fun` is called significantly more times with the slow input (90253 times) compared to the fast input (1 time). This indicates that the `fun` function is likely where the performance bottleneck lies.
   - The `for` loop inside `fun` (lines 22-26) is heavily involved, suggesting that the loop, and particularly the recursive call `fun(pos + 1, fl - i)`, is frequently executed for the slow input.

2. **Interaction with Data Structures**:
   - This function `fun` employs a dynamic programming approach, as suggested by the use of the `dp` array for memoization. However, the hit count suggests that memoization might not be effectively reducing the number of recursive calls for the slow input.
   - The problem constraints imply that `s` is the sum of digits, and for the slow input (`m=100, s=100`), the function explores many combinations of digits that sum to `100` over `100` positions, leading to excessive recursion.

3. **Input Constraints and Recursion**:
   - The recursion depth and branching factor are inherently tied to `m` and `s`. For larger values of `s` relative to `m`, there are more digit combinations to check, potentially causing a large recursive search space.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **Recursion Depth and Branching Factor**:
   - Natural Language Description: "If the sum of digits `s` is relatively high compared to the number of digits `m`, the recursion may explore a vast number of combinations, significantly slowing down the execution."
   - This invariant captures the condition where large sums must be distributed over a smaller number of digits, leading to high recursive call depth and extensive exploration.

2. **Memoization and DP Table Effectiveness**:
   - Natural Language Description: "If the dynamic programming table is not effectively reducing the number of recursive calls due to large unexplored states, performance may degrade."
   - This condition is met when the memoization (`dp` array) is either too large to be efficiently filled or frequently reset or bypassed.

3. **Digit Constraints and Feasibility**:
   - Natural Language Description: "For input combinations where the digit sum `s` is significantly large relative to `m`, and feasible digit assignments become scarce, execution time may increase."
   - This deals with the feasibility of arranging digits such that their sum is `s`, which becomes computationally expensive as `s` approaches the theoretical maximum (`9 * m`).

### Summary of Performance Invariants

- **Invariant A**: "When `s` approaches the maximum possible sum for `m` digits (`9*m`), the recursive exploration space increases, leading to potential slowdowns, especially when `m` is large."
- **Invariant B**: "If the memoization table (`dp`) is not fully utilized or optimally accessed, recursive calls may become excessive, degrading performance."
- **Invariant C**: "When digit sum `s` is large enough to require most digits to be near their maximum value, the search space may become larger, slowing down the function."

These statements help in understanding potential slow paths without relying on specific slow input values, adhering to the input constraints (`1 ≤ m ≤ 100, 0 ≤ s ≤ 900`). They also provide guidance for creating tests that could reveal performance issues with other similar inputs.

=== Checker Response ===
Let's proceed with Phase 3 by translating the identified performance-characterizing invariants into runtime checks in C++.

### Phase 3: Implement Performance-Characterizing Invariants in C++

1. **Invariant A**: "When `s` approaches the maximum possible sum for `m` digits (`9*m`), the recursive exploration space increases, leading to potential slowdowns, especially when `m` is large."
   
   ```cpp
   void check_recursion_bottleneck(int m, int s) {
       if (s > 8 * m) {  // A threshold to capture scenarios close to maximum digit sum
           cerr << "Warning: Recursion bottleneck triggered - large sum s relative to m" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Invariant B**: "If the memoization table (`dp`) is not fully utilized or optimally accessed, recursive calls may become excessive, degrading performance."
   
   This invariant is typically harder to check directly at runtime without performance profiling tools, but we can check the initialization state:

   ```cpp
   void check_dp_initialization(unsigned long long int dp[105][905]) {
       // Check if the dp table has been reset properly
       for (int i = 0; i <= 100; ++i) {
           for (int j = 0; j <= 900; ++j) {
               if (dp[i][j] != -1) {
                   cerr << "Warning: DP table not initialized properly!" << endl;
                   abort();
               }
           }
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Invariant C**: "When digit sum `s` is large enough to require most digits to be near their maximum value, the search space may become larger, slowing down the function."
   
   This invariant overlaps with Invariant A, so we can handle it with the same check.

### Phase 4: Integrate Checks with the Original Program

Now, let's integrate these checkers into the provided C++ code.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int m, l, s;
char c[103];
unsigned long long int dp[105][905];

// Checker functions for performance invariants

void check_recursion_bottleneck(int m, int s) {
    if (s > 8 * m) {  // A threshold to capture scenarios close to maximum digit sum
        cerr << "Warning: Recursion bottleneck triggered - large sum s relative to m" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_dp_initialization(unsigned long long int dp[105][905]) {
    // Check if the dp table has been reset properly
    for (int i = 0; i <= 100; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j <= 900; ++j) {
            if (dp[i][j] != -1) {
                cerr << "Warning: DP table not initialized properly!" << endl;
                abort();
            }
        }
    }
}

unsigned long long int fun(int pos, int fl) {
    int l;
    if (pos == m) {
        if (fl == 0)
            return 1LL;
        else
            return 0LL;
    }
    if (pos == 0)
        l = 1;
    else
        l = 0;
    if (m == 1 && pos == 0) l = 0;
    unsigned long long int &r = dp[pos][fl];
    if (r != -1) return r;
    r = 0;
    for (int i = l; i < 10; i++) {
        if ((fl - i) >= 0)
            r |= fun(pos + 1, fl - i);
        else
            break;
    }
    return r;
}

void path(int pos, int fl, unsigned long long int cnt) {
    if (pos == m) {
        return;
    }
    if (pos == 0)
        l = 1;
    else
        l = 0;
    for (int i = l; i < 10; i++) {
        if ((fl - i) >= 0) {
            unsigned long long int l = fun(pos, fl);
            cout << l << "con" << endl;
            if (cnt <= l) {
                cout << i;
                return path(pos + 1, fl - i, cnt);
            }
            cnt -= fun(pos + 1, fl - i);
        }
    }
    return;
}

void path1(int pos, int fl) {
    if (pos == m) {
        return;
    }
    if (pos == 0)
        l = 1;
    else
        l = 0;
    if (m == 1 && pos == 0) l = 0;
    for (int i = l; i < 10; i++) {
        if ((fl - i) >= 0) {
            unsigned long long int l = fun(pos + 1, fl - i);
            if (l >= 1) {
                cout << i;
                return path1(pos + 1, fl - i);
            }
        }
    }
    return;
}

void path2(int pos, int fl) {
    if (pos == m) {
        return;
    }
    if (pos == 0)
        l = 1;
    else
        l = 0;
    if (m == 1 && pos == 0) l = 0;
    for (int i = 9; i >= 0; i--) {
        if ((fl - i) >= 0) {
            unsigned long long int l = fun(pos, fl);
            if (l == 1) {
                cout << i;
                return path2(pos + 1, fl - i);
            }
        }
    }
    return;
}

int main() {
    cin >> m >> s;
    
    // Invariant check: recursion bottleneck due to large s relative to m
    check_recursion_bottleneck(m, s);

    memset(dp, -1, sizeof(dp));
    
    // Invariant check: ensure dp table is reset before use
    check_dp_initialization(dp);

    unsigned long long int r = fun(0, s);
    if (r) {
        path1(0, s);
    } else
        cout << "-1";
    cout << " ";
    if (r) {
        path2(0, s);
        cout << endl;
    } else
        cout << "-1" << endl;
}
```

### Explanation

- **Performance Invariants**: The checks are inserted immediately after reading the input and resetting the `dp` table. They ensure:
  - The program aborts if `s` is so large relative to `m` that it risks entering slow recursive paths.
  - The `dp` table is properly initialized, guarding against excessive recursive calls due to faulty memoization.
- **Placement**: The checks are strategically placed before the expensive computations begin, ensuring minimal overhead while still safeguarding the critical execution paths.
