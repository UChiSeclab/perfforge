=== Invariants Response ===
To diagnose the slowdown of the given C program for the provided inputs and to derive performance-characterizing invariants, we'll go through two phases: identifying inefficient code segments and deriving natural language invariants.

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Comparison of Hit Counts:**
   - The `tochar` function has a significant hit count during the slow execution, specifically 101 calls. This function uses a `stringstream` which can be inefficient for converting integers to characters, especially when called repeatedly in a loop.
   - The loop from lines 44 to 52 iterates 100 times during the slow execution, indicating that it processes many elements. This loop contains the `tochar` function call, amplifying the inefficiency.
   - The `revers_` function is called once during the slow execution, but the nested loops inside it (lines 13 to 18) process the input string, iterating over its length, which can be substantial due to `n = 100`.

2. **Interaction with Data Structures:**
   - The program constructs a string `s` by repeatedly calling `tochar` and appending characters. This construction involves repeated dynamic memory allocations and deallocations.
   - The nested loop in `revers_` tries to adjust the digits to avoid leading zeros, which involves iterating over the string multiple times.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the identified hotspots and inefficiencies, we can formulate the following performance invariants:

1. **Invariant: High Loop Iterations with Inefficient Conversion**
   - **Natural language description:** "When the length of the number (`n`) is large, and the process involves repeated conversion of integers to characters using inefficient methods, the program may slow down significantly. This is especially impactful if the sum of the digits (`s`) requires multiple iterations to distribute the digits optimally."
   
2. **Invariant: Nested Loop Processing on Large Strings**
   - **Natural language description:** "If the string representing the digits is long, and operations involve nested loops to adjust the digits (such as avoiding leading zeros), the program may incur a performance penalty. This is particularly true when `n` is large and the digit adjustments are frequent."

3. **Invariant: Large Input Size with Suboptimal Memory Handling**
   - **Natural language description:** "For large input sizes (`n` close to 100), if the program uses dynamic memory operations intensively (like appending characters in loops), it may experience slowdown due to increased overhead in managing memory allocations."

### Conclusion

The slow performance arises primarily due to the inefficient conversion of digits to characters and the handling of long strings with nested loops. The identified invariants capture conditions under which these inefficiencies become prominent, considering the constraints (1 ≤ m ≤ 100, 0 ≤ s ≤ 900). These invariants are broad enough to anticipate similar slowdowns with different inputs that satisfy these patterns.

### Phase 3: Implementing the Invariants as C++ Checkers

Below are the C++ code snippets that implement the performance-characterizing invariants derived from the analysis:

1. **Invariant: High Loop Iterations with Inefficient Conversion**

```cpp
void check_conversion_invariant(int n, int m) {
    if (n > 50 && m > 450) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to inefficient digit-to-character conversion!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

2. **Invariant: Nested Loop Processing on Large Strings**

```cpp
void check_nested_loop_invariant(int n, const string& s) {
    if (n > 50 && s.length() > 50) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to nested loop processing on large strings!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

3. **Invariant: Large Input Size with Suboptimal Memory Handling**

```cpp
void check_memory_invariant(int n, int m) {
    if (n > 90 && m > 800) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to large input size and potential suboptimal memory handling!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrating Checkers into the Original Program

Here is the instrumented C++ code with the above checkers integrated at effective points:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

char tochar(int n) {
    int m = n;
    char x;
    stringstream ss;
    ss << m;
    ss >> x;
    return x;
}

string revers_(string s) {
    string x;
    for (int i = s.size() - 1, j = 0; i >= 0, j < s.size(); i--, j++) {
        x += s[i];
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < x.size(); i++) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j < x.size(); j++) {
            if (x[i] == '0' && x[j] != '0') {
                x[i] = '1';
                x[j] = tochar((x[j] - '0') - 1);
                return x;
            }
        }
    }
    return x;
}

void check_conversion_invariant(int n, int m) {
    if (n > 50 && m > 450) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to inefficient digit-to-character conversion!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_nested_loop_invariant(int n, const string& s) {
    if (n > 50 && s.length() > 50) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to nested loop processing on large strings!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_memory_invariant(int n, int m) {
    if (n > 90 && m > 800) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to large input size and potential suboptimal memory handling!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    int n, m, x;
    cin >> n >> m;

    // Check for potential performance bottlenecks
    check_conversion_invariant(n, m);
    check_memory_invariant(n, m);

    x = m;
    string s;
    if (m == 0 && n != 1 || m > 9 * n) {
        cout << -1 << " " << -1;
        cout << endl;
        return 0;
    }
    if (m < 10) {
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            s += tochar(m);
            m = 0;
        }
    } else {
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (m >= 10) {
                s += tochar(9);
                m -= 9;
            } else {
                s += tochar(m);
                m = 0;
            }
        }
    }

    // Check after constructing the string
    check_nested_loop_invariant(n, s);

    if (x < 10 && n != 1) {
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (i == 0) {
                cout << 1;
                x -= 1;
            } else if (i == n - 1)
                cout << x;
            else
                cout << 0;
        }
        cout << " " << s;
        cout << endl;
    } else
        cout << revers_(s) << " " << s;
    cout << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of Instrumentation

- **Conversion Invariant:** Implemented as `check_conversion_invariant`, this is called immediately after reading inputs to catch inefficiencies early.
- **Nested Loop Invariant:** This is checked after generating the string `s`, using `check_nested_loop_invariant`, to detect when the nested loops might cause performance issues.
- **Memory Invariant:** The `check_memory_invariant` is also invoked early to analyze the overall size of the inputs and warn in advance. 

Each check is strategically placed to avoid overhead within the main processing loops, ensuring minimal performance degradation while rigorously detecting potential bottlenecks.
