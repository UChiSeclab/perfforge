=== Invariants Response ===
To diagnose the performance issue in the provided C program, we need to follow the structured approach described and generate performance-characterizing invariants.

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Hit Count Comparison**: 
   - The `plus1` and `minus1` functions are heavily used in the slow input, indicated by thousands of hit counts, whereas they are not used at all in the fast input.
   - Specifically, `minus1` has an exceptionally high hit count, particularly in the recursive call (`line 21`).

2. **Analysis of Functionality**:
   - Both `plus1` and `minus1` are recursively called to adjust the digit arrays `a` and `b` to achieve the desired sum of digits.
   - The recursion in `minus1` suggests a deep call stack due to the decrement operation being carried out as long as the last digit is zero, which implies a high branching factor and depth based on input values.

3. **Input Constraints Interaction**:
   - The program is designed to handle `m` up to 100 and `s` up to 900.
   - The slow input `100 100` likely causes recursion to occur deeply or frequently due to the high complexity of adjusting the number to meet the digit sum.
   - The fast input `3 100` does not trigger recursion since the constraints are not pushing it to its limits.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **Invariant on Recursion Depth and Iteration**:
   - **Natural Language Description**: "If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many recursive calls are required to adjust the digit sum, the computation may become very expensive."
   - **Threshold Consideration**: Given that `m` can be up to 100, high recursion depth and extensive loops are expected when `s` and `m` are near their upper bounds, potentially leading to many adjustments.

2. **Invariant on Input Size and Limits**:
   - **Natural Language Description**: "When both m and s are large, such that m is close to 100 and s approaches its upper limit relative to m (i.e., near the maximum digit sum possible for m), the code may enter a slow path due to high computational demand for number adjustments."
   - **Threshold Consideration**: The threshold here revolves around `m` and `s` being high, with `s` needing a precise configuration that requires many incremental adjustments.

### Final Set of Invariants

1. **Recursion and Loop Invariant**:
   - **Description**: "If a large number of recursive adjustments are needed due to the digit constraints of `m` and `s`, performance can degrade. This is especially true when the number of such recursive adjustments crosses a high threshold."

2. **Input Size and Constraint Invariant**:
   - **Description**: "The program is likely to experience slowdowns when both `m` and `s` are near their maximum constraints, causing extensive number configuration adjustments to achieve the target digit sum."

By focusing on these two key invariants, we can predict and understand performance bottlenecks without relying on specific input values, ensuring the invariants are general and applicable to a broader range of scenarios within the problem constraints.

=== Checker Response ===
To implement the performance-characterizing invariants in C++, we will first create checker functions based on the natural language descriptions. Then, we will integrate these checkers into the original program at appropriate places to catch performance bottlenecks without adding overhead in tight loops.

### Phase 3: Implement the Checkers in C++

Here are the C++ code snippets for the two performance invariants:

1. **Invariant on Recursion Depth and Iteration**:
   - We will create a checker function that monitors the depth of recursive calls and the number of iterations.

```cpp
void check_recursion_invariant(int recursionDepth, int maxDepth) {
    if (recursionDepth > maxDepth) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive recursion depth!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

2. **Invariant on Input Size and Limits**:
   - A checker function that validates whether inputs `m` and `s` are pushing the program towards its complexity limits.

```cpp
void check_input_size_invariant(int m, int s) {
    if (m > 90 && s > 810) { // Assuming these as thresholds near the upper limit
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - input size at limit!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrate the Checkers in the Original Program

We will now integrate these checker functions into the original C++ program.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Checkers for performance invariants
void check_recursion_invariant(int recursionDepth, int maxDepth) {
    if (recursionDepth > maxDepth) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive recursion depth!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_input_size_invariant(int m, int s) {
    if (m > 90 && s > 810) { // Assuming these as thresholds near the upper limit
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - input size at limit!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Update the plus1 and minus1 functions to track recursion depth
void plus1(int a[], int m, int depth) {
    check_recursion_invariant(depth, 100); // Check recursion depth
    if (a[0] == 9 && m == 0) {
        a[0] = -1;
        exit;
    }
    if (a[m] != 9)
        a[m]++;
    else
        plus1(a, m - 1, depth + 1);
}

void minus1(int b[], int m, int depth) {
    check_recursion_invariant(depth, 100); // Check recursion depth
    if (b[0] == 0 && m == 0) {
        b[0] = -1;
        exit;
    }
    if (b[m] != 0)
        b[m]--;
    else
        minus1(b, m - 1, depth + 1);
}

int main() {
    int i, j, m, sum, ans = 0;
    int a[101], b[101];
    std::cin >> m >> sum;

    // Input size invariant check
    check_input_size_invariant(m, sum);

    a[0] = 1;
    if (m != 1 && sum == 0) {
        std::cout << "-1 -1";
        return 0;
    }
    if (sum > 9 * m) {
        std::cout << "-1 -1";
        return 0;
    }
    if (m == 1 && sum == 0) {
        std::cout << "0 0";
        return 0;
    }
    for (i = 1; i < m; i++) a[i] = 0;
    for (i = 0; i < m; i++) b[i] = 9;
    int ss = 1;
    while (ss != sum) {
        plus1(a, m - 1, 1); // Start recursion depth at 1
        ss++;
        if (a[0] == -1) {
            std::cout << "-1 -1";
            return 0;
        }
    }
    ss = m * 9;
    while (ss != sum) {
        minus1(b, m - 1, 1); // Start recursion depth at 1
        ss--;
        ss = 0;
        for (i = 0; i < m; i++) ss += b[i];
    }
    for (i = 0; i < m; i++) std::cout << a[i];
    std::cout << ' ';
    for (i = 0; i < m; i++) std::cout << b[i];
    std::cin >> i;
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

- **Recursion Depth Check**: The `plus1` and `minus1` functions now take an additional parameter `depth` to track the depth of recursion. The `check_recursion_invariant` function is called to ensure that the recursion depth does not exceed a predefined threshold.
  
- **Input Size Check**: The `check_input_size_invariant` function is called immediately after reading `m` and `s` to verify that they do not approach the complexity limits that may cause performance issues.

These checks help identify situations where the program may slow down, especially during testing or fuzzing, to ensure robust performance.
