=== Invariants Response ===
To analyze and derive performance-characterizing invariants for the given C code, we will follow a two-phase approach: identifying expensive or inefficient code segments and then deriving natural language invariants describing the slowdown conditions.

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

#### Analysis of Hit Counts

1. **Function Calls**:
   - `DPmx` function is called significantly more times (445,510 times) compared to `DP` (101 times) in the slow input case.

2. **Conditional and Loop Analysis**:
   - In `DPmx`, the loop on line 50 is heavily executed (489,951 times), indicating a deep recursion or extensive search space exploration.
   - The memoization map (`mp`) lookup (line 36) and store (line 53) are also frequently hit, suggesting repeated states or inefficient state management.
   - The hit counts for `DPmx` in lines 35, 36, and 37 indicate repetitive checking of conditions without significant progress, likely due to redundant recursive calls.

3. **General Observations**:
   - The slow input (`100 1`) causes deep recursion, with `m1` and `s1` being explored extensively without efficient pruning of impossible states.
   - The recursive call stack depth and breadth (high number of branches at each level) contribute to the slowdown, especially with a high `m` value.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

From the above observations, we can derive the following natural language invariants to describe conditions under which the code enters a slow path:

1. **Recursive Depth and State Space**:
   - Natural Language Invariant: "If the number of digits `m` is large and the sum of digits `s` is small, the recursion in finding the maximum number triggers excessive calls due to a large search space with many equivalent states."

2. **Redundant State Exploration**:
   - Natural Language Invariant: "When `m` is high and `s` approaches zero, the recursive function explores a vast state space with redundant checks, causing inefficiencies and a slowdown due to insufficient pruning of the state tree."

3. **Memoization Inefficiency**:
   - Natural Language Invariant: "For large values of `m` combined with a low value of `s`, memoization fails to effectively reduce the number of computations, resulting in excessive redundant operations and contributing to the slow performance."

These invariants highlight the conditions under which the recursive approach becomes inefficient due to extensive state exploration without effective pruning or memoization, especially when `m` is large and `s` is small. The high hit counts on recursive calls and state checks confirm these conditions as performance bottlenecks.

=== Checker Response ===
Let's first implement the natural language invariants as C++ checker functions and then integrate them into the original C++ code.

### Phase 3: Implement Natural Language Invariants as Checkers

Here are the checkers implementing the derived invariants:

```cpp
void check_recursive_depth_invariant(int m, int s) {
    // This checks if m is large and s is small, leading to large recursive depth
    if (m > 50 && s < 10) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive recursive depth due to large m and small s!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_redundant_state_invariant(int m, int s) {
    // This checks for conditions where redundant state exploration might occur
    if (m > 50 && s <= 5) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - redundant state exploration due to low sum!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_memoization_inefficiency(int m, int s) {
    // Checking if memoization is ineffective with current m and s
    if (m > 75 && s <= 2) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - inefficient memoization with high m and low s!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrate Checkers into the Original Program

Now, let's integrate these checkers into the C++ program, placing them at effective points in the control flow to catch potential slowdowns without adding overhead inside tight loops.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Checker functions for performance bottlenecks
void check_recursive_depth_invariant(int m, int s) {
    if (m > 50 && s < 10) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive recursive depth due to large m and small s!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_redundant_state_invariant(int m, int s) {
    if (m > 50 && s <= 5) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - redundant state exploration due to low sum!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_memoization_inefficiency(int m, int s) {
    if (m > 75 && s <= 2) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - inefficient memoization with high m and low s!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

long long m = 0, s = 0;
string ans;
vector<map<long long, long long>> mp;

bool DP(long long m1, long long s1) {
    if (m1 == m) return s1 == s;
    if (mp[m1].find(s1) != mp[m1].end())
        return mp[m1][s1];
    else {
        if (m1 == 0) {
            for (long long i = 1; i < 10; i++) {
                if (DP(m1 + 1, s1 + i)) {
                    ans[m1] = '0' + i;
                    mp[m1][s1] = true;
                    return true;
                }
            }
            mp[m1][s1] = false;
            return false;
        } else {
            for (long long i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
                if (DP(m1 + 1, s1 + i)) {
                    ans[m1] = '0' + i;
                    mp[m1][s1] = true;
                    return true;
                }
            }
            mp[m1][s1] = false;
            return false;
        }
    }
}

bool DPmx(long long m1, long long s1) {
    if (m1 == m) return s1 == s;
    if (mp[m1].find(s1) != mp[m1].end())
        return mp[m1][s1];
    else {
        if (m1 == 0) {
            for (long long i = 9; i >= 1; i--) {
                if (DPmx(m1 + 1, s1 + i)) {
                    ans[m1] = '0' + i;
                    mp[m1][s1] = true;
                    return true;
                }
            }
            mp[m1][s1] = false;
            return false;
        } else {
            for (long long i = 9; i >= 0; i--) {
                if (DPmx(m1 + 1, s1 + i)) {
                    ans[m1] = '0' + i;
                    mp[m1][s1] = true;
                    return true;
                }
            }
            mp[m1][s1] = false;
            return false;
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false), cin.tie(NULL);
    cin >> m >> s;

    // Place checkers after input to catch potential slowdowns
    check_recursive_depth_invariant(m, s);
    check_redundant_state_invariant(m, s);
    check_memoization_inefficiency(m, s);

    ans.resize(m);
    mp.clear();
    mp.resize(m + 1);
    if (m == 1) {
        if (s <= 9)
            cout << s << " " << s << "\n";
        else
            cout << "-1 -1"
                 << "\n";
        return 0;
    }
    if (DP(0, 0))
        cout << ans << " ";
    else
        cout << "-1"
             << " ";
    mp.clear();
    mp.resize(m + 1);
    if (DPmx(0, 0))
        cout << ans;
    else
        cout << "-1";
    return 0;
}
```

In this instrumented code, the checkers are placed right after reading the input values `m` and `s` in the `main` function. This ensures that before any heavy computations or recursive calls, the program verifies whether it is at risk of entering a known performance bottleneck. If any of the specified conditions are met, the program will output a warning and terminate, thus aiding in identifying performance issues during testing or fuzzing.
