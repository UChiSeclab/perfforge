system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

International Abbreviation Olympiad takes place annually starting from 1989. Each year the competition receives an abbreviation of form IAO'y, where y stands for some number of consequent last digits of the current year. Organizers always pick an abbreviation with non-empty string y that has never been used before. Among all such valid abbreviations they choose the shortest one and announce it to be the abbreviation of this year's competition.

For example, the first three Olympiads (years 1989, 1990 and 1991, respectively) received the abbreviations IAO'9, IAO'0 and IAO'1, while the competition in 2015 received an abbreviation IAO'15, as IAO'5 has been already used in 1995.

You are given a list of abbreviations. For each of them determine the year it stands for.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of abbreviations to process. 

Then n lines follow, each containing a single abbreviation. It's guaranteed that each abbreviation contains at most nine digits.

Output

For each abbreviation given in the input, find the year of the corresponding Olympiad.

assistant: To analyze the performance bottlenecks in the given C code and derive performance-characterizing invariants, we need to follow the two phases of analysis: identifying inefficient code segments and deriving natural language invariants.

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Line-by-line Analysis:**
   - The significant difference in line-level hit counts between the fast and slow inputs occurs primarily in the `solve` function.
   - Lines 3, 4, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, and 25 show a much higher hit count for the slow input compared to the fast input. Notably, lines 23-25 indicate a recursive call pattern, which implies that the recursion depth could be high.

2. **Recursive Calls:**
   - The line `m = max(m, 1 + solve(sub));` (line 25) shows that the function `solve` is called recursively for substrings of decreasing size.
   - The recursion continues until the substring is empty, which suggests that the recursion depth is proportional to the length of the string.

3. **Loops and Recursion:**
   - The loop at line 21 and the recursive calls at line 25 suggest that the computation involves repeated operations based on the string length.
   - Line 21's loop, which calculates a power of ten (`p10`), is hit multiple times, indicating repeated computation for each digit in the string.

4. **Complexity Implication:**
   - The recursive calls and the loop inside `solve` imply a possible exponential time complexity, especially when dealing with strings that have many non-leading zeros.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the analysis, the following natural language performance-characterizing invariants can be derived:

1. **Invariant for Deep Recursion:**
   - "If the abbreviation contains many non-zero digits, especially leading zeros, the program may enter a deep recursion, leading to slower execution. This is likely to occur when the substring lengths decrease slowly, causing many recursive calls."

2. **Invariant for String Length and Looping:**
   - "If the abbreviation has a long string of digits, particularly with non-zero digits that aren't easily trimmed by leading zero removal, the code will execute nested loops and recursive calls extensively, causing performance degradation."

3. **Invariant for Exponential Growth of Computation:**
   - "When the abbreviation consists of a complex pattern of digits that leads to repeated recalculations of possible years, the computation time can increase exponentially, especially as the abbreviation length approaches its maximum limit."

### Conclusion

The code's performance is primarily hindered by the depth and breadth of recursion triggered by certain input patterns. Long strings with complex digit sequences, including leading zeros, exacerbate this issue, leading to repeated recursive calls and extensive looping operations. To address these, one might look into optimizing the recursive approach or using memoization to avoid redundant calculations.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
International Abbreviation Olympiad takes place annually starting from 1989. Each year the competition receives an abbreviation of form IAO'y, where y stands for some number of consequent last digits of the current year. Organizers always pick an abbreviation with non-empty string y that has never been used before. Among all such valid abbreviations they choose the shortest one and announce it to be the abbreviation of this year's competition.

For example, the first three Olympiads (years 1989, 1990 and 1991, respectively) received the abbreviations IAO'9, IAO'0 and IAO'1, while the competition in 2015 received an abbreviation IAO'15, as IAO'5 has been already used in 1995.

You are given a list of abbreviations. For each of them determine the year it stands for.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of abbreviations to process. 

Then n lines follow, each containing a single abbreviation. It's guaranteed that each abbreviation contains at most nine digits.

Output

For each abbreviation given in the input, find the year of the corresponding Olympiad.

assistant: ### Phase 3: Implementing Natural Language Invariants as C++ Code

Based on the performance-characterizing invariants derived earlier, the following C++ code snippets check the conditions under which the program is likely to slow down:

1. **Invariant for Deep Recursion:**

   ```cpp
   void check_recursion_invariant(int currentDepth, int maxDepth) {
       if (currentDepth > maxDepth) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - recursion depth too high!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Invariant for String Length and Looping:**

   ```cpp
   void check_string_length_invariant(const string& s, int maxLength) {
       if (s.length() > maxLength) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - string length too long for efficient processing!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Invariant for Exponential Growth of Computation:**

   ```cpp
   void check_exponential_growth_invariant(const string& s, int threshold) {
       int nonZeroCount = count_if(s.begin(), s.end(), [](char c){ return c != '0'; });
       if (nonZeroCount > threshold) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive non-zero digits leading to exponential computation!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Integrating Checkers into the Original Program

Here's the complete instrumented C++ program with the integrated performance checks:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Checkers for performance invariants

// Checks if recursion depth exceeds a reasonable limit
void check_recursion_invariant(int currentDepth, int maxDepth) {
    if (currentDepth > maxDepth) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - recursion depth too high!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Checks if the string length is too long for efficient processing
void check_string_length_invariant(const string& s, int maxLength) {
    if (s.length() > maxLength) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - string length too long for efficient processing!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Checks if the number of non-zero digits could lead to exponential computation
void check_exponential_growth_invariant(const string& s, int threshold) {
    int nonZeroCount = count_if(s.begin(), s.end(), [](char c){ return c != '0'; });
    if (nonZeroCount > threshold) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive non-zero digits leading to exponential computation!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

long long solve(string s, int depth = 0) {
    // Check recursion depth
    check_recursion_invariant(depth, 20);  // Arbitrary threshold for recursion depth

### Explanation of Integrated Checkers

- **Recursion Depth Checker:** Ensures that the recursion depth does not exceed an arbitrary threshold, preventing excessive recursive calls.
- **String Length Checker:** Validates that the string length does not surpass the maximum length specified by the problem constraints.
- **Exponential Growth Checker:** Counts non-zero digits to avoid excessive computation through recursive calls, enforcing a threshold to prevent exponential growth.

These checks provide runtime warnings and halt execution if performance bottlenecks are triggered, aiding in identifying potential slow inputs during testing or fuzzing.
