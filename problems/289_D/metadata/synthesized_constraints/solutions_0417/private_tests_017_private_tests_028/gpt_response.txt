=== Invariants Response ===
Based on the analysis of the provided C program and the hit count data, we can establish performance-characterizing invariants that might explain the slowdown observed with certain inputs, especially "slow" inputs compared to "fast" ones.

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Comparison of Line-Level Hit Counts:**
   - The function `dfs(int curr)` experiences a significant hit count in the slow input, with multiple recursive calls (lines 7-14). No hits on fast input.
   - The function `rec(int idx)` also shows a high number of recursive calls (lines 16-27) for the slow input, especially lines 17, 20, and 24-26.

2. **Pinpointing Hotspots:**
   - The main issue seems to be the recursive exploration in both `dfs` and `rec` functions. The recursive calls are triggered significantly more often in the slow input scenario, suggesting deep recursion or a large search space.

3. **Data Structures and Input Constraints:**
   - The program uses arrays `niz` and `memo` with maximum size based on `max_k`, but the recursion depth and the branching factor seem more influenced by the value of `k` itself.
   - Given `n` can be as large as 1000, but `k` is restricted to `min(8, n)`, the heavy recursion is likely due to exhaustive permutations when `k` is maximal.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **Natural Language Statements:**

   - **Invariant 1: Exhaustive Combinatorial Search:**
     "If the number `k` approaches its upper bound (e.g., `k` close to its maximum permissible value), and recursive functions explore extensively over permutations, the program may slow down considerably. This is especially true when the recursion depth and branching factor increase combinatorially with each increment in `k`."

   - **Invariant 2: Recursive Depth and Branching:**
     "When the recursive depth and branching factor are high due to a large `k`, resulting in repeated calls to expensive recursive functions such as `dfs`, the code may enter a slow execution path. This can happen even if `n` is not maximized but `k` is close to its limit."

   - **Invariant 3: Recursive Function Overhead:**
     "If the recursive functions `rec` and `dfs` are invoked excessively due to the structure of `k`, which dictates heavy branching and deep recursive paths, performance may degrade. The overhead is especially pronounced when `k` is near the upper limit of 8."

2. **Suggestions for Thresholds:**
   - The critical factor for slowdown appears to be `k` approaching its maximum limit (e.g., `k = 8`), where the permutation space becomes large enough to exhaustively explore, resulting in combinatorially increasing recursive calls.

These invariants capture the conditions leading to slowdowns in a way that aligns with the constraints of the problem (`n <= 1000`, `k <= min(8, n)`), providing clear indications of when and why the performance may degrade.

### Phase 3: Implementing the Natural Language Invariants in C++

For each invariant identified earlier, we will write a checker function in C++ to detect potential performance bottlenecks during execution.

#### Invariant 1: Exhaustive Combinatorial Search
*Natural Language Description:* "If `k` approaches its upper bound, and recursive functions explore extensively over permutations, the program may slow down considerably."

```cpp
void check_combinatorial_invariant(int k, int maxK) {
    if (k == maxK) {
        cerr << "Warning: combinatorial_invariant triggered - high value of k!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

#### Invariant 2: Recursive Depth and Branching
*Natural Language Description:* "When the recursive depth and branching factor are high due to a large `k`, the code may enter a slow execution path."

```cpp
void check_recursive_depth_invariant(int depth, int threshold) {
    if (depth > threshold) {
        cerr << "Warning: recursive_depth_invariant triggered - excessive recursive depth!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

#### Invariant 3: Recursive Function Overhead
*Natural Language Description:* "If the recursive functions are invoked excessively due to `k`, performance may degrade."

```cpp
void check_recursive_overhead_invariant(int recursionCalls, int maxCalls) {
    if (recursionCalls > maxCalls) {
        cerr << "Warning: recursive_overhead_invariant triggered - excessive recursive calls!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Propagating and Inserting Conditional Checks

Now, we integrate these checks into the original C++ program, placing them at points before potentially expensive operations to avoid adding overhead in tight loops.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
const int MOD = 1e9 + 7;
const int max_k = 10;
long long n, k, cnt, ret = 1, niz[max_k], memo[max_k];
bool ok, onstack[max_k];

void check_combinatorial_invariant(int k, int maxK) {
    if (k == maxK) {
        cerr << "Warning: combinatorial_invariant triggered - high value of k!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_recursive_depth_invariant(int depth, int threshold) {
    if (depth > threshold) {
        cerr << "Warning: recursive_depth_invariant triggered - excessive recursive depth!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_recursive_overhead_invariant(int recursionCalls, int maxCalls) {
    if (recursionCalls > maxCalls) {
        cerr << "Warning: recursive_overhead_invariant triggered - excessive recursive calls!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

bool dfs(int curr, int depth) {
    check_recursive_depth_invariant(depth, 50); // Check for excessive recursion depth
    if (!curr) return true;
    if (memo[curr] != -1) return memo[curr];
    if (onstack[curr]) return memo[curr] = false;
    onstack[curr] = true;
    memo[curr] = dfs(niz[curr], depth + 1);
    onstack[curr] = false;
    return memo[curr];
}

void rec(int idx, int *recursionCalls) {
    (*recursionCalls)++;
    check_recursive_overhead_invariant(*recursionCalls, 500000); // Check for excessive recursive calls
    if (idx == k) {
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) memo[i] = -1;
        ok = true;
        for (int i = 1; i < k; i++) ok &= dfs(i, 0);
        cnt += ok;
        return;
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
        niz[idx] = i;
        rec(idx + 1, recursionCalls);
    }
}

int main() {
    cin >> n >> k;
    check_combinatorial_invariant(k, max_k - 2); // Check for high combinatorial value of k

    for (int i = 0; i < n - k; i++) ret = (ret * (n - k)) % MOD;

    int recursionCalls = 0;
    rec(0, &recursionCalls);

    cout << (cnt * ret) % MOD;
    return 0;
}
```

**Notes:**
- **Placement of Checks:** The combinatorial invariant is checked before starting the recursive process, considering potential impacts on recursion. The recursive depth and overhead checks are placed within their respective functions to monitor recursion effectively.
- **Thresholds:** Ensure thresholds are set according to the problem constraints and are reasonable to catch performance issues without false positives.
