system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

Little penguin Polo loves his home village. The village has n houses, indexed by integers from 1 to n. Each house has a plaque containing an integer, the i-th house has a plaque containing integer pi (1 ≤ pi ≤ n).

Little penguin Polo loves walking around this village. The walk looks like that. First he stands by a house number x. Then he goes to the house whose number is written on the plaque of house x (that is, to house px), then he goes to the house whose number is written on the plaque of house px (that is, to house ppx), and so on.

We know that:

  1. When the penguin starts walking from any house indexed from 1 to k, inclusive, he can walk to house number 1. 
  2. When the penguin starts walking from any house indexed from k + 1 to n, inclusive, he definitely cannot walk to house number 1. 
  3. When the penguin starts walking from house number 1, he can get back to house number 1 after some non-zero number of walks from a house to a house. 



You need to find the number of ways you may write the numbers on the houses' plaques so as to fulfill the three above described conditions. Print the remainder after dividing this number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).

Input

The single line contains two space-separated integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ k ≤ min(8, n)) — the number of the houses and the number k from the statement.

Output

In a single line print a single integer — the answer to the problem modulo 1000000007 (109 + 7).

assistant: Based on the analysis of the provided C program and the hit count data, we can establish performance-characterizing invariants that might explain the slowdown observed with certain inputs, especially "slow" inputs compared to "fast" ones.

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Comparison of Line-Level Hit Counts:**
   - The function `dfs(int curr)` experiences a significant hit count in the slow input, with multiple recursive calls (lines 7-14). No hits on fast input.
   - The function `rec(int idx)` also shows a high number of recursive calls (lines 16-27) for the slow input, especially lines 17, 20, and 24-26.

2. **Pinpointing Hotspots:**
   - The main issue seems to be the recursive exploration in both `dfs` and `rec` functions. The recursive calls are triggered significantly more often in the slow input scenario, suggesting deep recursion or a large search space.

3. **Data Structures and Input Constraints:**
   - The program uses arrays `niz` and `memo` with maximum size based on `max_k`, but the recursion depth and the branching factor seem more influenced by the value of `k` itself.
   - Given `n` can be as large as 1000, but `k` is restricted to `min(8, n)`, the heavy recursion is likely due to exhaustive permutations when `k` is maximal.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **Natural Language Statements:**

   - **Invariant 1: Exhaustive Combinatorial Search:**
     "If the number `k` approaches its upper bound (e.g., `k` close to its maximum permissible value), and recursive functions explore extensively over permutations, the program may slow down considerably. This is especially true when the recursion depth and branching factor increase combinatorially with each increment in `k`."

   - **Invariant 2: Recursive Depth and Branching:**
     "When the recursive depth and branching factor are high due to a large `k`, resulting in repeated calls to expensive recursive functions such as `dfs`, the code may enter a slow execution path. This can happen even if `n` is not maximized but `k` is close to its limit."

   - **Invariant 3: Recursive Function Overhead:**
     "If the recursive functions `rec` and `dfs` are invoked excessively due to the structure of `k`, which dictates heavy branching and deep recursive paths, performance may degrade. The overhead is especially pronounced when `k` is near the upper limit of 8."

2. **Suggestions for Thresholds:**
   - The critical factor for slowdown appears to be `k` approaching its maximum limit (e.g., `k = 8`), where the permutation space becomes large enough to exhaustively explore, resulting in combinatorially increasing recursive calls.

These invariants capture the conditions leading to slowdowns in a way that aligns with the constraints of the problem (`n <= 1000`, `k <= min(8, n)`), providing clear indications of when and why the performance may degrade.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
Little penguin Polo loves his home village. The village has n houses, indexed by integers from 1 to n. Each house has a plaque containing an integer, the i-th house has a plaque containing integer pi (1 ≤ pi ≤ n).

Little penguin Polo loves walking around this village. The walk looks like that. First he stands by a house number x. Then he goes to the house whose number is written on the plaque of house x (that is, to house px), then he goes to the house whose number is written on the plaque of house px (that is, to house ppx), and so on.

We know that:

  1. When the penguin starts walking from any house indexed from 1 to k, inclusive, he can walk to house number 1. 
  2. When the penguin starts walking from any house indexed from k + 1 to n, inclusive, he definitely cannot walk to house number 1. 
  3. When the penguin starts walking from house number 1, he can get back to house number 1 after some non-zero number of walks from a house to a house. 



You need to find the number of ways you may write the numbers on the houses' plaques so as to fulfill the three above described conditions. Print the remainder after dividing this number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).

Input

The single line contains two space-separated integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ k ≤ min(8, n)) — the number of the houses and the number k from the statement.

Output

In a single line print a single integer — the answer to the problem modulo 1000000007 (109 + 7).

assistant: ### Phase 3: Implementing the Natural Language Invariants in C++

For each invariant identified earlier, we will write a checker function in C++ to detect potential performance bottlenecks during execution.

#### Invariant 1: Exhaustive Combinatorial Search
*Natural Language Description:* "If `k` approaches its upper bound, and recursive functions explore extensively over permutations, the program may slow down considerably."

```cpp
void check_combinatorial_invariant(int k, int maxK) {
    if (k == maxK) {
        cerr << "Warning: combinatorial_invariant triggered - high value of k!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

#### Invariant 2: Recursive Depth and Branching
*Natural Language Description:* "When the recursive depth and branching factor are high due to a large `k`, the code may enter a slow execution path."

```cpp
void check_recursive_depth_invariant(int depth, int threshold) {
    if (depth > threshold) {
        cerr << "Warning: recursive_depth_invariant triggered - excessive recursive depth!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

#### Invariant 3: Recursive Function Overhead
*Natural Language Description:* "If the recursive functions are invoked excessively due to `k`, performance may degrade."

```cpp
void check_recursive_overhead_invariant(int recursionCalls, int maxCalls) {
    if (recursionCalls > maxCalls) {
        cerr << "Warning: recursive_overhead_invariant triggered - excessive recursive calls!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Propagating and Inserting Conditional Checks

Now, we integrate these checks into the original C++ program, placing them at points before potentially expensive operations to avoid adding overhead in tight loops.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
const int MOD = 1e9 + 7;
const int max_k = 10;
long long n, k, cnt, ret = 1, niz[max_k], memo[max_k];
bool ok, onstack[max_k];

void check_combinatorial_invariant(int k, int maxK) {
    if (k == maxK) {
        cerr << "Warning: combinatorial_invariant triggered - high value of k!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_recursive_depth_invariant(int depth, int threshold) {
    if (depth > threshold) {
        cerr << "Warning: recursive_depth_invariant triggered - excessive recursive depth!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_recursive_overhead_invariant(int recursionCalls, int maxCalls) {
    if (recursionCalls > maxCalls) {
        cerr << "Warning: recursive_overhead_invariant triggered - excessive recursive calls!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

bool dfs(int curr, int depth) {
    check_recursive_depth_invariant(depth, 50); // Check for excessive recursion depth
    if (!curr) return true;
    if (memo[curr] != -1) return memo[curr];
    if (onstack[curr]) return memo[curr] = false;
    onstack[curr] = true;
    memo[curr] = dfs(niz[curr], depth + 1);
    onstack[curr] = false;
    return memo[curr];
}

void rec(int idx, int *recursionCalls) {
    (*recursionCalls)++;
    check_recursive_overhead_invariant(*recursionCalls, 500000); // Check for excessive recursive calls
    if (idx == k) {
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) memo[i] = -1;
        ok = true;
        for (int i = 1; i < k; i++) ok &= dfs(i, 0);
        cnt += ok;

int main() {
    cin >> n >> k;
    check_combinatorial_invariant(k, max_k - 2); // Check for high combinatorial value of k

    for (int i = 0; i < n - k; i++) ret = (ret * (n - k)) % MOD;

    int recursionCalls = 0;

```

**Notes:**
- **Placement of Checks:** The combinatorial invariant is checked before starting the recursive process, considering potential impacts on recursion. The recursive depth and overhead checks are placed within their respective functions to monitor recursion effectively.
- **Thresholds:** Ensure thresholds are set according to the problem constraints and are reasonable to catch performance issues without false positives.
