### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

Based on the line-level hit counts provided, the slowdown for the slow input primarily occurs in the following areas:

1. **Recursive Function `rec` (Line 20)**: This function is called 19,173,961 times for the slow input compared to only 2 times for the fast input. The recursive nature, combined with the high hit count, suggests that the recursive depth and branching factor are significant contributors to the slowdown.

2. **Function `can` and its Nested Function `walk` (Lines 21-30)**: These lines are heavily hit for the slow input, indicating that the check to see if a house can reach house number 1 involves a lot of repetitive calculations or checks. This likely involves traversing paths multiple times due to the recursive structure.

3. **Line 38**: This line, part of a loop within the recursive function, shows a high hit count, indicating that the permutation generation for house plaques is a heavy operation when `k` is large.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Here are some performance-characterizing invariants based on the analysis above:

1. **High Recursion Depth with Large `k`**: 
   - Natural language description: "When `k` is close to its maximum value (k ≤ min(8, n)), the recursive permutation generation for the first `k` houses can lead to extensive recursive calls, exploring numerous permutations. This results in a slowdown as the algorithm exhaustively attempts every combination."
   
   - This invariant captures the exponential growth of combinations as `k` increases, especially when `k` approaches the upper limit of 8.

2. **Excessive Path Checking for Reachability**:
   - Natural language description: "If the number of recursive checks for reachability to house number 1 increases, particularly when `k` is high, the function may repeatedly traverse paths, causing a slowdown due to the repetitive validation steps."
   
   - This invariant highlights the inefficiency in repeatedly checking paths for reachability, especially with a higher starting point `k`.

3. **Inefficiency in Large Combinatorial Space**:
   - Natural language description: "The combinatorial explosion in possible configurations for house plaques results in excessive computational overhead, notably when `k` reaches its upper threshold."
   
   - This invariant points out that the combinatorial nature of the problem, with high `k`, leads to excessive calculations and checks, overwhelming the computational resources.

These invariants should help in understanding the conditions under which the performance degrades and provide a basis for detecting such slow scenarios in the future. The primary trigger for slow performance is a combination of high recursion depth and branching due to the permutation generation and reachability checks when `k` is large.

### Phase 3: Implement the Natural Language Invariants in C++

Here's how you can translate the identified performance-characterizing invariants into runtime checks with C++ code:

1. **High Recursion Depth with Large `k`**:

   ```cpp
   void check_recursion_invariant(bool condition) {
       if (condition) {
           cerr << "Warning: Recursion depth and branching factor too high with large k!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Excessive Path Checking for Reachability**:

   ```cpp
   void check_reachability_invariant(bool condition) {
       if (condition) {
           cerr << "Warning: Excessive checks for reachability to house number 1!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Inefficiency in Large Combinatorial Space**:

   ```cpp
   void check_combinatorial_invariant(bool condition) {
       if (condition) {
           cerr << "Warning: Combinatorial explosion due to large k!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Integrate Runtime Checks into the Original Program

Now, let's integrate these checks into the provided C++ program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

const int MOD = 1e9 + 7, maxN = 1005, maxK = 10;

// Function to check recursion depth and branching factor invariant
void check_recursion_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Recursion depth and branching factor too high with large k!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Function to check excessive path checking invariant
void check_reachability_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Excessive checks for reachability to house number 1!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Function to check combinatorial explosion invariant
void check_combinatorial_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Combinatorial explosion due to large k!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int power(const int n, const int k) {
    if (!k) return 1;
    int res = power(n, k >> 1);
    res = (1LL * (res) * (res) % MOD);
    if (k & 1) res = (1LL * (res) * (n) % MOD);
    return res;
}

int n, res, k, p[maxK];

void rec(const int i) {
    static function<bool(const int)> can = [&](const int x) -> bool {
        static int cnt = 0, vis[maxN];
        ++cnt;
        static function<bool(const int)> walk = [&](const int x) -> bool {
            if (x == 1) return true;
            if (vis[x] == cnt) return false;
            vis[x] = cnt;
            return walk(p[x]);
        };
        return walk(x);
    };

    if (i < 1) {
        for (int i = (2), _b = (k); i <= _b; ++i)
            if (!can(i)) return;
        res = (((res) + (1)) % MOD);
        return;
    }

    for (p[i] = 1; p[i] <= k; ++p[i]) rec(i - 1);
}

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
    cin.tie(0);
    cout.tie(0);
    cin >> n >> k;

    // Check the combinatorial explosion and recursion depth
    check_combinatorial_invariant(k == 8);
    check_recursion_invariant(k == 8);

    rec(k);

    // Check excessive path checking before executing the power function
    check_reachability_invariant(k == 8);

    res = (1LL * (res) * (power(n - k, n - k)) % MOD);
    cout << res << '\n';
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of Check Integration

1. **Combinatorial Explosion** and **Recursion Checks**: Both these checks are placed before the recursive permutation generation call `rec(k)`. They ensure the program warns about excessive recursion and combinatorial explosion when `k` reaches its upper threshold of 8.

2. **Reachability Check**: This check is placed after the recursive computation and before the final power calculation to ensure that excessive reachability checks are flagged when `k` is maxed out.

These checks are strategically placed to catch performance bottlenecks without adding overhead to critical loops or recursive calls, aligning with constraints such as `1 ≤ n ≤ 1000` and `1 ≤ k ≤ min(8, n)`.
