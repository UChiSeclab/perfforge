=== Invariants Response ===
Based on the given code and its performance characteristics, let's analyze the bottlenecks and create performance-characterizing invariants.

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Sorting Operations**: 
   - The `sort` function is called twice using custom comparators `cmp1` and `cmp2`, which are invoked multiple times (120 and 74 times respectively for slow input). These functions are critical because they are called in sorting operations, which could become bottlenecks depending on the input distribution.

2. **Nested If Conditions with Maps**:
   - Lines 23-26 and 39-42 involve checking the presence of keys in maps (row, col, d1, d2). These checks form a critical part of the logic for determining threats and are repeated for each queen, which could lead to inefficiencies if map operations are expensive in practice.

3. **Complexity with Data Structures**: 
   - The use of map data structures adds overhead, as every insertion and lookup is an O(log m) operation. With m as large as 100,000, this can become significant, especially given the nested nature of some operations.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants (Natural Language)

1. **Sorting Large Number of Queens**:
   - **Invariant**: "When the number of queens, m, is large, and the queens are positioned such that sorting operations on their rows or columns lead to extensive comparisons, the program may slow down significantly."
   - **Reasoning**: The sorting operations are invoked with m elements, and when m is large, these operations dominate the runtime. The worst-case scenario occurs when the queens' positions require numerous comparisons.

2. **Repeated Map Lookups and Insertions**:
   - **Invariant**: "If the number of queens approaches the maximum limit and the queens are positioned in such a way that triggers several map lookups and insertions, performance may degrade."
   - **Reasoning**: The presence of maps for each direction (row, column, diagonals) means that for each queen, multiple map operations are performed. As m grows, these operations add up, particularly if queens are positioned such that many are aligned.

3. **High Density of Queens**:
   - **Invariant**: "If the queens are densely packed on the board, leading to frequent updates and checks across shared rows, columns, or diagonals, the algorithm may experience slowdowns."
   - **Reasoning**: Dense configurations necessitate frequent map updates and checks, exacerbating the cost of these operations.

By understanding these conditions, we can predict scenarios that may lead to slow execution and potentially optimize the code by selecting more efficient data structures or improving sorting strategies to avoid excessive redundant operations.

=== Checker Response ===
### Phase 3: Implementing Checkers for Performance Invariants

Based on the previously derived performance-characterizing invariants, here are the C++ checkers:

1. **Checker for Large Number of Elements in Sorting**:
   ```cpp
   void check_sort_invariant(int m) {
       if (m > 50000) { // Example threshold for large m
           cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - sorting a large number of queens" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Checker for Repeated Map Lookups and Insertions**:
   ```cpp
   void check_map_operations_invariant(int m) {
       if (m > 50000) { // Example threshold indicating heavy map operations
           cerr << "Warning: map_operations_invariant triggered - excessive map operations for a large number of queens" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Checker for High Density of Queens**:
   ```cpp
   void check_queen_density_invariant(int n, int m) {
       if (m > 0.8 * n * n) { // Example threshold for high density of queens
           cerr << "Warning: queen_density_invariant triggered - high density of queens on the board" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Integrating Checkers with the Original Code

Now, let's integrate these checkers into the original C++ program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
const int inf = 1e5 + 9;
pair<pair<int, int>, int> a[inf];
map<int, int> row, col, d1, d2;
int atta[inf], ans[inf];

// Define the checkers
void check_sort_invariant(int m) {
    if (m > 50000) { // Example threshold for large m
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - sorting a large number of queens" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_map_operations_invariant(int m) {
    if (m > 50000) { // Example threshold indicating heavy map operations
        cerr << "Warning: map_operations_invariant triggered - excessive map operations for a large number of queens" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_queen_density_invariant(int n, int m) {
    if (m > 0.8 * n * n) { // Example threshold for high density of queens
        cerr << "Warning: queen_density_invariant triggered - high density of queens on the board" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    int n, m;
    cin >> n >> m;

    // Integrate the checkers at appropriate points
    check_sort_invariant(m);
    check_map_operations_invariant(m);
    check_queen_density_invariant(n, m);

    for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++)
        cin >> a[i].first.first >> a[i].first.second, a[i].second = i;
    
    sort(a + 1, a + 1 + m, cmp1);
    for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
        int x = a[i].first.first, y = a[i].first.second, id = a[i].second;
        if (row.find(x) != row.end()) atta[id]++;
        if (col.find(y) != col.end()) atta[id]++;
        if (d1.find(x + y) != d1.end()) atta[id]++;
        if (d2.find(x - y) != d2.end()) atta[id]++;
        d2[x - y] = 1;
        d1[x + y] = 1;
        col[y] = 1;
        row[x] = 1;
    }
    row.clear();
    col.clear();
    d2.clear();
    d1.clear();
    sort(a + 1, a + 1 + m, cmp2);
    for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
        int x = a[i].first.first, y = a[i].first.second, id = a[i].second;
        if (row.find(x) != row.end()) atta[id]++;
        if (col.find(y) != col.end()) atta[id]++;
        if (d1.find(x + y) != d1.end()) atta[id]++;
        if (d2.find(x - y) != d2.end()) atta[id]++;
        d2[x - y] = 1;
        d1[x + y] = 1;
        col[y] = 1;
        row[x] = 1;
    }
    for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) ans[atta[i]]++;
    for (int i = 0; i <= 8; i++) cout << ans[i] << " ";
}
```

### Explanation

- The checkers are placed right after reading `n` and `m`, as these values affect the conditions being checked. This ensures that the program warns of potential bottlenecks early on.
- The threshold values (`50000` and `0.8 * n * n`) are illustrative and can be adjusted based on empirical data or further analysis.
- Each checker is designed to catch specific performance bottlenecks as described in the natural language invariants.
