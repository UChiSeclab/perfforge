system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

A queen is the strongest chess piece. In modern chess the queen can move any number of squares in any horizontal, vertical or diagonal direction (considering that there're no other pieces on its way). The queen combines the options given to the rook and the bishop.

There are m queens on a square n × n chessboard. You know each queen's positions, the i-th queen is positioned in the square (ri, ci), where ri is the board row number (numbered from the top to the bottom from 1 to n), and ci is the board's column number (numbered from the left to the right from 1 to n). No two queens share the same position.

For each queen one can count w — the number of other queens that the given queen threatens (attacks). For a fixed attack direction only the first queen in this direction is under attack if there are many queens are on the ray of the attack. Obviously, for any queen w is between 0 and 8, inclusive.

Print the sequence t0, t1, ..., t8, where ti is the number of queens that threaten exactly i other queens, i.e. the number of queens that their w equals i.

Input

The first line of the input contains a pair of integers n, m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 105), where n is the size of the board and m is the number of queens on the board. Then m following lines contain positions of the queens, one per line. Each line contains a pair of integers ri, ci (1 ≤ ri, ci ≤ n) — the queen's position. No two queens stand on the same square.

Output

Print the required sequence t0, t1, ..., t8, separating the numbers with spaces.

assistant: To address the problem of performance bottlenecks in the given C program that calculates the threat levels of queens on a chessboard, let's analyze the code and hit count data to derive performance-characterizing invariants. 

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Line-Level Hit Count Observation**:
   - The `check(int num)` function is called `m` times, which is expected since it's iterating over all queens. This is evidenced by identical hit counts on lines 5, 6, 7, 13, 19, 27, and 36 for both inputs.
   - Lines that involve condition checks within `check` function (lines 21, 22, 25) have higher hit counts on the slow input compared to the fast input. This indicates that more operations are being performed for those checks, suggesting more interactions with the data structures representing queen positions for the slow input.
   - Memory allocation in the loops, particularly for `ac` and `bd` arrays (lines 52 to 56), shows a significant discrepancy between slow and fast runs, indicating extensive memory operations proportional to `n`.

2. **Data Structures and Logic**:
   - The program uses several 2D arrays (`ac`, `bd`, `ad`, `ab`) to track the min and max positions of queens along various directions.
   - The code checks and updates these arrays for each queen's position, thus performing potentially expensive operations to calculate the number of threats (w).

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the analysis, here are the natural language performance invariants:

1. **Memory Allocation and Initialization**:
   - "If the size of the chessboard (`n`) is large, especially close to the maximum constraint, the memory allocation and initialization of auxiliary arrays (`ac`, `bd`, etc.) can become a significant bottleneck."
   - This is due to the initialization loops running `2n` times for `ac` and `bd`, and `n` times for `ad` and `ab`, leading to increased overhead.

2. **Complexity of Threat Calculation**:
   - "When the number of queens (`m`) is substantial, and they are densely positioned such that multiple queens are directly threatening each other in horizontal, vertical, or diagonal lines, the repeated checking and updating of positions for these directions can lead to performance degradation."
   - This is highlighted by the hit counts in the `check` function related to conditions (lines 21, 22, 25), which are more frequently triggered in complex configurations where many queens threaten each other.

3. **Sparse vs. Dense Configurations**:
   - "Sparse configurations of queens on the board tend to execute the checking logic faster. However, as the configuration becomes denser, with many queens aligning on the same row, column, or diagonal, the number of operations in checking their threats significantly increases, leading to slow execution paths."
   - This demonstrates that specific input patterns (dense clustering of queens) rather than just the size of the input can trigger slow executions.

### Conclusion

These invariants provide insight into potential bottlenecks by focusing on high-level conditions that affect performance. They abstract the specific values from input and focus on patterns like board size and queen density, which are critical to identifying future slow scenarios.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
A queen is the strongest chess piece. In modern chess the queen can move any number of squares in any horizontal, vertical or diagonal direction (considering that there're no other pieces on its way). The queen combines the options given to the rook and the bishop.

There are m queens on a square n × n chessboard. You know each queen's positions, the i-th queen is positioned in the square (ri, ci), where ri is the board row number (numbered from the top to the bottom from 1 to n), and ci is the board's column number (numbered from the left to the right from 1 to n). No two queens share the same position.

For each queen one can count w — the number of other queens that the given queen threatens (attacks). For a fixed attack direction only the first queen in this direction is under attack if there are many queens are on the ray of the attack. Obviously, for any queen w is between 0 and 8, inclusive.

Print the sequence t0, t1, ..., t8, where ti is the number of queens that threaten exactly i other queens, i.e. the number of queens that their w equals i.

Input

The first line of the input contains a pair of integers n, m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 105), where n is the size of the board and m is the number of queens on the board. Then m following lines contain positions of the queens, one per line. Each line contains a pair of integers ri, ci (1 ≤ ri, ci ≤ n) — the queen's position. No two queens stand on the same square.

Output

Print the required sequence t0, t1, ..., t8, separating the numbers with spaces.

assistant: Let's address the task of transforming the performance-characterizing invariants into runtime checks in C++. We'll first write separate checker functions based on the invariants and then integrate these checks into the original C++ solution.

### Phase 3: Implementing the Invariants in C++

Here are the C++ code snippets implementing the natural language invariants as runtime checks:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Check for memory allocation and initialization bottleneck
void check_memory_invariant(int n) {
    if (n > 50000) {  // Threshold based on practical experience
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - Large board size impacting memory allocation!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Check for complex threat calculation bottleneck
void check_threat_calculation_invariant(int m, int highInteractionCount) {
    if (m > 1000 && highInteractionCount > 500) {  // Example thresholds for queen density and interactions
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - High complexity of threat calculation due to dense queen positions!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Check for sparse vs. dense configurations
void check_configuration_invariant(int m, int denseClusterCount) {
    if (denseClusterCount > 100) {  // Example threshold for dense clustering of queens
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - Dense queen configurations causing slow execution!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrating Checks in the Original Program

Now, let's integrate these checks into the original C++ code at appropriate points to help diagnose performance issues:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Check functions as discussed earlier
void check_memory_invariant(int n) {
    if (n > 50000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - Large board size impacting memory allocation!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_threat_calculation_invariant(int m, int highInteractionCount) {
    if (m > 1000 && highInteractionCount > 500) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - High complexity of threat calculation due to dense queen positions!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_configuration_invariant(int m, int denseClusterCount) {
    if (denseClusterCount > 100) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - Dense queen configurations causing slow execution!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

```

### Explanation
- **`check_memory_invariant`**: Checks if the board size `n` is too large, affecting memory operations.
- **`check_threat_calculation_invariant`**: Checks if the number of queens and their interactions make the calculation complex.
- **`check_configuration_invariant`**: Checks if queens are densely packed, causing potential slowdowns.

These checks help identify scenarios where the program might slow down significantly due to certain board configurations and number of queens, aligning with the problem constraints and potential bottlenecks.
