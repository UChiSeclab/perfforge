system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

A queen is the strongest chess piece. In modern chess the queen can move any number of squares in any horizontal, vertical or diagonal direction (considering that there're no other pieces on its way). The queen combines the options given to the rook and the bishop.

There are m queens on a square n × n chessboard. You know each queen's positions, the i-th queen is positioned in the square (ri, ci), where ri is the board row number (numbered from the top to the bottom from 1 to n), and ci is the board's column number (numbered from the left to the right from 1 to n). No two queens share the same position.

For each queen one can count w — the number of other queens that the given queen threatens (attacks). For a fixed attack direction only the first queen in this direction is under attack if there are many queens are on the ray of the attack. Obviously, for any queen w is between 0 and 8, inclusive.

Print the sequence t0, t1, ..., t8, where ti is the number of queens that threaten exactly i other queens, i.e. the number of queens that their w equals i.

Input

The first line of the input contains a pair of integers n, m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 105), where n is the size of the board and m is the number of queens on the board. Then m following lines contain positions of the queens, one per line. Each line contains a pair of integers ri, ci (1 ≤ ri, ci ≤ n) — the queen's position. No two queens stand on the same square.

Output

Print the required sequence t0, t1, ..., t8, separating the numbers with spaces.

assistant: To diagnose the performance issues in the provided C program, let's analyze and derive performance-characterizing invariants based on the given information.

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Compare Line-Level Hit Counts:**
   - The loop starting at line 8, which processes each queen, is heavily hit (20 times for the slow input vs. 1 time for the fast input).
   - Lines within this loop (lines 10-29) involve several map accesses and updates, which are frequent under the slow input.
   - The second loop starting at line 31 also has numerous hits (20 for the slow input vs. 1 for the fast input), indicating intensive computation.

2. **Pinpoint Lines/Functions with More Hits:**
   - The map operations (in lines 10-29) are significantly more frequent for the slow input. This suggests that these lines may be creating a bottleneck due to the complexity of managing multiple maps.

3. **Interaction with Data Structures:**
   - The maps (`mx2`, `mx1`, `mn1`, `mn2`, `nx1`, `nx2`, `nn1`, `nn2`) track maximum and minimum indices along different lines of movement, leading to a lot of updates and comparisons.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the analysis, here are the natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.

1. **High Density of Queens:**
   - "When the number of queens (`m`) is large relative to the size of the board (`n`), the maps used to track maximum and minimum positions on rows and diagonals become heavily updated, leading to performance degradation. This is especially true when `m` approaches `n^2/2`, indicating a significant portion of the board is occupied."

2. **Complex Map Operations:**
   - "If each queen's position results in updates to multiple maps (due to alignment along rows, columns, and diagonals), the resulting map operations can become a bottleneck. This is exacerbated when queens are highly clustered, leading to frequent position updates in the same map entries."

3. **High Threat Count Computation:**
   - "Calculating the number of threats each queen imposes can become costly when many queens are aligned along the same lines of attack. This results in frequent checks and increments in the threat counting loop."

These invariants abstract away from using specific numeric values from the slow input and are designed to catch potential slow scenarios in other similar configurations. The focus is on situations where the input configuration leads to complex interactions and updates within the underlying data structures.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
A queen is the strongest chess piece. In modern chess the queen can move any number of squares in any horizontal, vertical or diagonal direction (considering that there're no other pieces on its way). The queen combines the options given to the rook and the bishop.

There are m queens on a square n × n chessboard. You know each queen's positions, the i-th queen is positioned in the square (ri, ci), where ri is the board row number (numbered from the top to the bottom from 1 to n), and ci is the board's column number (numbered from the left to the right from 1 to n). No two queens share the same position.

For each queen one can count w — the number of other queens that the given queen threatens (attacks). For a fixed attack direction only the first queen in this direction is under attack if there are many queens are on the ray of the attack. Obviously, for any queen w is between 0 and 8, inclusive.

Print the sequence t0, t1, ..., t8, where ti is the number of queens that threaten exactly i other queens, i.e. the number of queens that their w equals i.

Input

The first line of the input contains a pair of integers n, m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 105), where n is the size of the board and m is the number of queens on the board. Then m following lines contain positions of the queens, one per line. Each line contains a pair of integers ri, ci (1 ≤ ri, ci ≤ n) — the queen's position. No two queens stand on the same square.

Output

Print the required sequence t0, t1, ..., t8, separating the numbers with spaces.

assistant: ### Phase 3: Implementing the Natural Language Invariants in C++

Based on the derived invariants, we will implement checker functions to identify when the performance bottlenecks are likely to occur.

#### Invariant 1: High Density of Queens
```cpp
void check_density_invariant(int n, int m) {
    if (m > n * n / 2) {
        cerr << "Warning: density_invariant triggered - high density of queens on the board!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

#### Invariant 2: Complex Map Operations
```cpp
void check_map_operation_invariant(int mapSize) {
    if (mapSize > 10000) { // Arbitrary threshold based on typical operations complexity
        cerr << "Warning: map_operation_invariant triggered - complex map operations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

#### Invariant 3: High Threat Count Computation
```cpp
void check_threats_invariant(int threatsPerQueen) {
    if (threatsPerQueen > 6) { // If most queens threaten many others
        cerr << "Warning: threats_invariant triggered - many queens threatening others!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrate Checker Functions into the Original Program

We will incorporate these checker functions into the provided C++ code at appropriate locations to ensure we are not adding unnecessary overhead in tight loops.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int n, t[1001], k;
map<int, int> mx2, mx1, mn1, mn2, nx1, nx2, nn1, nn2;
pair<int, int> pr[1000001];

void check_density_invariant(int n, int m) {
    if (m > n * n / 2) {
        cerr << "Warning: density_invariant triggered - high density of queens on the board!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_map_operation_invariant(int mapSize) {
    if (mapSize > 10000) {
        cerr << "Warning: map_operation_invariant triggered - complex map operations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_threats_invariant(int threatsPerQueen) {
    if (threatsPerQueen > 6) {
        cerr << "Warning: threats_invariant triggered - many queens threatening others!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    cin >> k >> n;
    
    // Check for high density of queens
    check_density_invariant(n, k);

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        scanf("%d%d", &pr[i].first, &pr[i].second);
        if (mn2[pr[i].first - pr[i].second] == 0)
            mn2[pr[i].first - pr[i].second] = 1e9;
        mx2[pr[i].first - pr[i].second] =
            max(mx2[pr[i].first - pr[i].second], pr[i].first);
        mn2[pr[i].first - pr[i].second] =
            min(mn2[pr[i].first - pr[i].second], pr[i].first);
        if (mn1[pr[i].first + pr[i].second] == 0)
            mn1[pr[i].first + pr[i].second] = 1e9;
        mx1[pr[i].first + pr[i].second] =
            max(mx1[pr[i].first + pr[i].second], pr[i].first);
        mn1[pr[i].first + pr[i].second] =
            min(mn1[pr[i].first + pr[i].second], pr[i].first);
        if (nn1[pr[i].first] == 0) nn1[pr[i].first] = 1e9;
        nx1[pr[i].first] = max(nx1[pr[i].first], pr[i].second);
        nn1[pr[i].first] = min(nn1[pr[i].first], pr[i].second);
        if (nn2[pr[i].second] == 0) {
            nn2[pr[i].second] = 1e9;
        }
        nx2[pr[i].second] = max(nx2[pr[i].second], pr[i].first);
        nn2[pr[i].second] = min(nn2[pr[i].second], pr[i].first);
    }

    // Check map operations complexity
    check_map_operation_invariant(mx2.size());
    check_map_operation_invariant(mx1.size());
    check_map_operation_invariant(mn1.size());
    check_map_operation_invariant(mn2.size());
    check_map_operation_invariant(nx1.size());
    check_map_operation_invariant(nx2.size());
    check_map_operation_invariant(nn1.size());
    check_map_operation_invariant(nn2.size());

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        int y = 0;
        if (mn2[pr[i].first - pr[i].second] < pr[i].first) y++;
        if (mx2[pr[i].first - pr[i].second] > pr[i].first) y++;
        if (mn1[pr[i].first + pr[i].second] < pr[i].first) y++;
        if (mx1[pr[i].first + pr[i].second] > pr[i].first) y++;
        if (nn1[pr[i].first] < pr[i].second) y++;
        if (nx1[pr[i].first] > pr[i].second) y++;
        if (nn2[pr[i].second] < pr[i].first) y++;
        if (nx2[pr[i].second] > pr[i].first) y++;

        // Check threats per queen
        check_threats_invariant(y);
        
        t[y]++;
    }
    for (int i = 0; i <= 8; i++) cout << t[i] << " ";
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

- **Density Invariant:** This check is placed right after reading the input to quickly assess the board density.
- **Map Operation Invariant:** Check the size of each map structure after filling them to ensure that operations don't become too complex.
- **Threats Invariant:** Placed inside the loop that counts threats to ensure we are not going beyond a reasonable number of threats per queen.

These checks should help in identifying scenarios where the program might experience performance bottlenecks due to the identified characteristics.
