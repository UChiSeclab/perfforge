system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

Pari wants to buy an expensive chocolate from Arya. She has n coins, the value of the i-th coin is ci. The price of the chocolate is k, so Pari will take a subset of her coins with sum equal to k and give it to Arya.

Looking at her coins, a question came to her mind: after giving the coins to Arya, what values does Arya can make with them? She is jealous and she doesn't want Arya to make a lot of values. So she wants to know all the values x, such that Arya will be able to make x using some subset of coins with the sum k.

Formally, Pari wants to know the values x such that there exists a subset of coins with the sum k such that some subset of this subset has the sum x, i.e. there is exists some way to pay for the chocolate, such that Arya will be able to make the sum x using these coins.

Input

The first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 500) — the number of coins and the price of the chocolate, respectively.

Next line will contain n integers c1, c2, ..., cn (1 ≤ ci ≤ 500) — the values of Pari's coins.

It's guaranteed that one can make value k using these coins.

Output

First line of the output must contain a single integer q— the number of suitable values x. Then print q integers in ascending order — the values that Arya can make for some subset of coins of Pari that pays for the chocolate.

assistant: ### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Comparison of Line-Level Hit Counts:**
   - The line with the highest discrepancy in hit counts between the slow and fast inputs is line 21, which involves a nested loop iterating over potential subset sums (`l`) for each coin. This line is executed 29,709 times for the slow input versus 15,293 times for the fast input.
   - Similarly, line 29, another loop over possible sums, shows significantly higher executions for the slow input (59,241 times) compared to the fast input (39,368 times).

2. **Identification of Critical Lines:**
   - **Lines 21-25:** This nested loop is critical as it checks if a subset sum can be formed with the current coin and updates possible sums. The high execution count suggests that this loop's performance is impacted significantly by the values of `k` and the arrangement of `A`.
   - **Lines 29-31:** Another nested loop focusing on propagating possible sums. This loop also has a high execution count, indicating it contributes significantly to the slowdown.

3. **Interaction with Data Structures:**
   - The 3D DP table `DP[j][i][l]` suggests a high complexity, with dimensions proportional to `n` and `k`. Each iteration over `k` and `l` can be expensive, especially when `k` is close to its upper limit.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **Invariant on Coin Values and `k`:** 
   - **Natural Language Description:** "If `k` is close to its maximum limit (500) and the coins include values that closely partition subsets to sum to `k` or near it, performance may degrade due to extensive subset exploration."
   - **Reasoning:** The problem complexity heavily relies on exploring all possible combinations of coin values that sum up to `k`. When `k` is large and coins are structured such that many subsets can potentially sum to values up to `k`, the DP table is filled more extensively.

2. **Invariant on Loop Execution:**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "When the dynamic programming approach requires iterating over many potential sums for each coin (especially when `k` is large), the nested loops may cause a slowdown."
   - **Reasoning:** The execution of the nested loops over possible subset sums (`l` from 0 to `k`) implies that larger `k` values lead to significantly more iterations, thus increasing execution time.

3. **Invariant on Initialization and Updates in DP Table:**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "If the initialization and update steps of the DP table involve a high number of operations due to large `k`, this can lead to performance bottlenecks, especially in the presence of coins that allow various subset sums."
   - **Reasoning:** Every update in the DP table involves multiple checks and potential updates, which are computationally expensive when `k` is large.

These performance-characterizing invariants identify general scenarios where the given approach may face bottlenecks, particularly focusing on how `k` and the structure of `A` affect execution time.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
Pari wants to buy an expensive chocolate from Arya. She has n coins, the value of the i-th coin is ci. The price of the chocolate is k, so Pari will take a subset of her coins with sum equal to k and give it to Arya.

Looking at her coins, a question came to her mind: after giving the coins to Arya, what values does Arya can make with them? She is jealous and she doesn't want Arya to make a lot of values. So she wants to know all the values x, such that Arya will be able to make x using some subset of coins with the sum k.

Formally, Pari wants to know the values x such that there exists a subset of coins with the sum k such that some subset of this subset has the sum x, i.e. there is exists some way to pay for the chocolate, such that Arya will be able to make the sum x using these coins.

Input

The first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 500) — the number of coins and the price of the chocolate, respectively.

Next line will contain n integers c1, c2, ..., cn (1 ≤ ci ≤ 500) — the values of Pari's coins.

It's guaranteed that one can make value k using these coins.

Output

First line of the output must contain a single integer q— the number of suitable values x. Then print q integers in ascending order — the values that Arya can make for some subset of coins of Pari that pays for the chocolate.

assistant: ### Phase 3: Implementing Natural Language Invariants in C++

Below are the implementations of the performance-characterizing invariants in C++ using runtime checks:

1. **Invariant on Coin Values and `k`:**

   ```cpp
   void check_k_threshold(int k) {
       if (k > 450) { // Threshold chosen considering maximum limit and complexity growth
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - k is close to maximum limit!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Invariant on Loop Execution:**

   ```cpp
   void check_loop_iterations(int k, int n) {
       if (k > 450 && n > 10) { // Thresholds reflecting the impact of large k and significant n
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high loop iterations expected!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Invariant on Initialization and Updates in DP Table:**

   ```cpp
   void check_dp_initialization_and_updates(int k, int n) {
       if (k > 450 && n > 10) { // Same as previous check because they are related
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - extensive DP table operations!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Integrating Checkers into the Original C++ Program

Below is the instrumented C++ code with the integrated performance-checking functions:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Checker function implementations
void check_k_threshold(int k) {
    if (k > 450) { // Threshold chosen considering maximum limit and complexity growth
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - k is close to maximum limit!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_loop_iterations(int k, int n) {
    if (k > 450 && n > 10) { // Thresholds reflecting the impact of large k and significant n
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high loop iterations expected!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_dp_initialization_and_updates(int k, int n) {
    if (k > 450 && n > 10) { // Same as previous check because they are related
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - extensive DP table operations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    int n, k;
    cin >> n >> k;

    // Insert checks after reading inputs
    check_k_threshold(k);
    check_loop_iterations(k, n);
    check_dp_initialization_and_updates(k, n);

    int A[n];
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        cin >> A[i];
    }
    
    vector<vector<vector<bool> > > DP(
        k + 1, vector<vector<bool> >(n, vector<bool>(k + 1, false)));

    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        DP[0][i][0] = true;
    }
    
    if (A[0] <= k) {
        DP[A[0]][0][0] = true;
        DP[A[0]][0][A[0]] = true;
    }
    
    for (int j = 1; j <= k; j++) {
        for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
            for (int l = 0; l <= k && j - A[i] >= 0; ++l) {
                if (DP[j - A[i]][i - 1][l]) {
                    DP[j][i][l] = true;
                    if (l + A[i] <= k) {
                        DP[j][i][l + A[i]] = true;
                    }
                }
            }
            for (int l = 0; l <= k; ++l) {
                if (DP[j][i - 1][l]) {
                    DP[j][i][l] = true;
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    int sum = 0;
    for (int l = 0; l <= k; ++l) {
        if (DP[k][n - 1][l]) {
            sum++;
        }
    }
    cout << sum << "\n";
    for (int l = 0; l <= k; ++l) {
        if (DP[k][n - 1][l]) {
            cout << l << " ";
        }
    }
}
```

### Comments on Integration:

- **Placement of Checks:** The checks are placed after reading inputs and before any heavy computational loops to avoid adding overhead inside the loops.
- **Thresholds:** The chosen thresholds (e.g., `k > 450`) are based on the upper bounds of input constraints to predict conditions likely to trigger slow execution paths. These are speculative and may need adjustment based on further profiling or specific use cases.
- **Overlapping Checks:** Some checks overlap due to the conditions they monitor, but they are kept separate for clarity and specific identification of issues.
