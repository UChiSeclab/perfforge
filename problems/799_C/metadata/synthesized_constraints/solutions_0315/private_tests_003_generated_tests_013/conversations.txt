system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

Arkady plays Gardenscapes a lot. Arkady wants to build two new fountains. There are n available fountains, for each fountain its beauty and cost are known. There are two types of money in the game: coins and diamonds, so each fountain cost can be either in coins or diamonds. No money changes between the types are allowed.

Help Arkady to find two fountains with maximum total beauty so that he can buy both at the same time.

Input

The first line contains three integers n, c and d (2 ≤ n ≤ 100 000, 0 ≤ c, d ≤ 100 000) — the number of fountains, the number of coins and diamonds Arkady has.

The next n lines describe fountains. Each of these lines contain two integers bi and pi (1 ≤ bi, pi ≤ 100 000) — the beauty and the cost of the i-th fountain, and then a letter "C" or "D", describing in which type of money is the cost of fountain i: in coins or in diamonds, respectively.

Output

Print the maximum total beauty of exactly two fountains Arkady can build. If he can't build two fountains, print 0.

Examples

Input

3 7 6
10 8 C
4 3 C
5 6 D


Output

9


Input

2 4 5
2 5 C
2 1 D


Output

0


Input

3 10 10
5 5 C
5 5 C
10 11 D


Output

10

Note

In the first example Arkady should build the second fountain with beauty 4, which costs 3 coins. The first fountain he can't build because he don't have enough coins. Also Arkady should build the third fountain with beauty 5 which costs 6 diamonds. Thus the total beauty of built fountains is 9.

In the second example there are two fountains, but Arkady can't build both of them, because he needs 5 coins for the first fountain, and Arkady has only 4 coins.

assistant: Based on the provided code, inputs, and hit counts, let's analyze the performance bottlenecks and derive performance-characterizing invariants:

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Hit Count Analysis:**
   - The lines inside the function `func(int p)` from 45 to 51 have significantly higher hit counts for the slow input compared to the fast input. Specifically, lines 45 and 48 are hit 100,002 times, and 200,002 times respectively with the slow input.
   - These lines contain loops that iterate based on the variable `in`, which represents the number of coins or diamonds Arkady has. With the slow input, `in` is set to 100,000, causing these loops to iterate extensively.

2. **Code Segment Description:**
   - The first loop at line 45 updates an array `dp` for each possible cost `i` from 1 to half of `in`. It ensures that each `dp[i]` contains the maximum beauty achievable with cost `i`.
   - The second loop at line 48 checks combinations of costs `i` and `j` (where `i + j = in`) to find the maximum combined beauty, leading to quadratic time complexity for each invocation of `func`.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on this analysis, we can derive the following performance-characterizing invariants:

1. **High Cost Capacity Trigger:**
   - **Natural Language Invariant:** "If the sum of coins and diamonds (c + d) is large, the program's performance may degrade significantly due to extensive iterations over potential cost combinations."
   - **Explanation:** When `c` or `d` reach their upper limit (e.g., 100,000), the program becomes slow because it executes nested loops to explore all possible cost combinations of fountains.

2. **High Coin/Diamond Value for Fountains:**
   - **Natural Language Invariant:** "If the individual cost values for fountains are high in comparison to available resources, extensive computations may occur due to repeated checks and updates in dynamic programming arrays."
   - **Explanation:** The algorithm's efficiency heavily relies on iterating over possible cost values, meaning that high-cost fountains can lead to increased iterations and dynamic programming array updates.

3. **Maximum Search Space Exploration:**
   - **Natural Language Invariant:** "When attempting to find combinations of fountains with a total cost near the limit of available coins or diamonds, the computation involves checking many potential combinations, which can slow down execution."
   - **Explanation:** The program checks all pairs of cost values up to `c` or `d`, which becomes computationally expensive when these values are near their maximum.

These invariants highlight conditions under which the program slows down and offer a guideline for fuzzing or testing scenarios that might lead to performance bottlenecks. By focusing on the combination of available resources and fountain costs, these invariants help predict and avoid extensive computations that degrade performance.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
Arkady plays Gardenscapes a lot. Arkady wants to build two new fountains. There are n available fountains, for each fountain its beauty and cost are known. There are two types of money in the game: coins and diamonds, so each fountain cost can be either in coins or diamonds. No money changes between the types are allowed.

Help Arkady to find two fountains with maximum total beauty so that he can buy both at the same time.

Input

The first line contains three integers n, c and d (2 ≤ n ≤ 100 000, 0 ≤ c, d ≤ 100 000) — the number of fountains, the number of coins and diamonds Arkady has.

The next n lines describe fountains. Each of these lines contain two integers bi and pi (1 ≤ bi, pi ≤ 100 000) — the beauty and the cost of the i-th fountain, and then a letter "C" or "D", describing in which type of money is the cost of fountain i: in coins or in diamonds, respectively.

Output

Print the maximum total beauty of exactly two fountains Arkady can build. If he can't build two fountains, print 0.

Examples

Input

3 7 6
10 8 C
4 3 C
5 6 D


Output

9


Input

2 4 5
2 5 C
2 1 D


Output

0


Input

3 10 10
5 5 C
5 5 C
10 11 D


Output

10

Note

In the first example Arkady should build the second fountain with beauty 4, which costs 3 coins. The first fountain he can't build because he don't have enough coins. Also Arkady should build the third fountain with beauty 5 which costs 6 diamonds. Thus the total beauty of built fountains is 9.

In the second example there are two fountains, but Arkady can't build both of them, because he needs 5 coins for the first fountain, and Arkady has only 4 coins. 

Solution (C++ code):
{solution}


assistant: Let's start with Phase 3, where we will translate the performance-characterizing invariants into checker code in C++.

### Phase 3: Implementing Invariants as Checker Code in C++

Based on the natural language invariants derived previously, here is the C++ code for the checks:

1. **High Cost Capacity Trigger:**
   ```cpp
   void check_high_cost_capacity(int c, int d) {
       if (c + d > 150000) { // A threshold based on high combined capacity
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high cost capacity!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **High Coin/Diamond Value for Fountains:**
   ```cpp
   void check_high_value_fountains(const vector<pair<int, int>>& vxC, const vector<pair<int, int>>& vxD, int c, int d) {
       for (const auto& fountain : vxC) {
           if (fountain.first > c * 0.8) { // Check if cost is high relative to available coins
               cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high coin value for a fountain!" << endl;
               abort();
           }
       }
       for (const auto& fountain : vxD) {
           if (fountain.first > d * 0.8) { // Check if cost is high relative to available diamonds
               cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high diamond value for a fountain!" << endl;
               abort();
           }
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Maximum Search Space Exploration:**
   ```cpp
   void check_search_space_exploration(int c, int d) {
       if (c > 80000 || d > 80000) { // Arbitrarily chosen high thresholds based on experience
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - maximum search space exploration!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Integrating Checker Code into the Original C++ Program

Now, let's integrate these checks into the original C++ program, placing them at effective points to avoid adding overhead in tight loops.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int n, m, i, j, k, ans = 0, za, ma, xi = -1, yi = -1, q, ma1 = -1, ma2 = -1, x, y, c, d, in;
vector<pair<int, int>> vx[2];
char ch;

// High cost capacity trigger
void check_high_cost_capacity(int c, int d) {
    if (c + d > 150000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high cost capacity!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// High coin/diamond value for fountains
void check_high_value_fountains(const vector<pair<int, int>>& vxC, const vector<pair<int, int>>& vxD, int c, int d) {
    for (const auto& fountain : vxC) {
        if (fountain.first > c * 0.8) {
            cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high coin value for a fountain!" << endl;
            abort();
        }
    }
    for (const auto& fountain : vxD) {
        if (fountain.first > d * 0.8) {
            cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high diamond value for a fountain!" << endl;
            abort();
        }
    }
}

// Maximum search space exploration
void check_search_space_exploration(int c, int d) {
    if (c > 80000 || d > 80000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - maximum search space exploration!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int func(int p) {
    if (p == 0) {
        in = c;
    } else {
        in = d;
    }
    q = -1;
    m = vx[p].size();
    
    multiset<int> mu;
    multiset<int>::iterator it;
    for (i = 1; i < m; i++) {
        x = vx[p][i].first;
        y = vx[p][i].second;
        if (x == vx[p][i - 1].first && 2 * x <= in) {
            q = max(q, y + vx[p][i - 1].second);
        }
    }
    for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        x = vx[p][i].first;
        y = vx[p][i].second;
        if (2 * x <= in) {
            mu.insert(y);
        }
    }
    if (mu.size() > 1) {
        it = mu.end();
        it--;
        x = *it;
        it--;
        y = *it;
        q = max(q, x + y);
    }
    int dp[100005] = {0};
    for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        x = vx[p][i].first;
        y = vx[p][i].second;
        dp[x] = max(dp[x], y);
    }
    for (i = 1; 2 * i <= in; i++) {
        dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[i - 1]);
    }
    for (i = in; i > 0; i--) {
        j = in - i;
        if (dp[i] > 0 && dp[j] > 0 && i != j) {
            q = max(q, dp[i] + dp[j]);
        }
    }
    return q;
}

int main() {
    cin >> n >> c >> d;

    // Run initial checks after reading input
    check_high_cost_capacity(c, d);
    check_search_space_exploration(c, d);

    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        cin >> x >> y >> ch;
        if (ch == 'C') {
            vx[0].push_back(make_pair(y, x));
        } else {
            vx[1].push_back(make_pair(y, x));
        }
    }

    // Check for high value fountains
    check_high_value_fountains(vx[0], vx[1], c, d);

    sort(vx[0].begin(), vx[0].end());
    sort(vx[1].begin(), vx[1].end());

    for (i = 0; i < vx[0].size(); i++) {
        x = vx[0][i].first;
        y = vx[0][i].second;
        if (x <= c) {
            xi = max(xi, y);
        }
    }
    for (i = 0; i < vx[1].size(); i++) {
        x = vx[1][i].first;
        y = vx[1][i].second;
        if (x <= d) {
            yi = max(yi, y);
        }
    }
    za = func(0);
    ma = max(ma, za);
    za = func(1);
    ma = max(ma, za);
    if (ma == -1) {
        if (xi == -1 || yi == -1) {
            cout << "0";
        } else {
            cout << xi + yi;
        }
    } else {
        if (xi == -1 || yi == -1) {
            cout << ma;
        } else {
            cout << max(ma, xi + yi);
        }
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of Changes:

- **High Cost Capacity Trigger:** This check is placed right after reading `c` and `d` values to ensure it doesn't affect loop performance.
- **High Coin/Diamond Value for Fountains:** The check is executed after the fountain data is read to flag any high-cost fountains relative to available resources.
- **Maximum Search Space Exploration:** This check is also placed after reading input values to prevent unnecessary computations when resources are exceedingly large.

These checks are strategically placed to help identify potential performance bottlenecks without introducing significant overhead in computation-critical areas of the code.
