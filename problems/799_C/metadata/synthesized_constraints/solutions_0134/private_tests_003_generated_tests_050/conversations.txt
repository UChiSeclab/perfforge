system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

Arkady plays Gardenscapes a lot. Arkady wants to build two new fountains. There are n available fountains, for each fountain its beauty and cost are known. There are two types of money in the game: coins and diamonds, so each fountain cost can be either in coins or diamonds. No money changes between the types are allowed.

Help Arkady to find two fountains with maximum total beauty so that he can buy both at the same time.

Input

The first line contains three integers n, c and d (2 ≤ n ≤ 100 000, 0 ≤ c, d ≤ 100 000) — the number of fountains, the number of coins and diamonds Arkady has.

The next n lines describe fountains. Each of these lines contain two integers bi and pi (1 ≤ bi, pi ≤ 100 000) — the beauty and the cost of the i-th fountain, and then a letter "C" or "D", describing in which type of money is the cost of fountain i: in coins or in diamonds, respectively.

Output

Print the maximum total beauty of exactly two fountains Arkady can build. If he can't build two fountains, print 0.

Examples

Input

3 7 6
10 8 C
4 3 C
5 6 D


Output

9


Input

2 4 5
2 5 C
2 1 D


Output

0


Input

3 10 10
5 5 C
5 5 C
10 11 D


Output

10

Note

In the first example Arkady should build the second fountain with beauty 4, which costs 3 coins. The first fountain he can't build because he don't have enough coins. Also Arkady should build the third fountain with beauty 5 which costs 6 diamonds. Thus the total beauty of built fountains is 9.

In the second example there are two fountains, but Arkady can't build both of them, because he needs 5 coins for the first fountain, and Arkady has only 4 coins.

assistant: To identify performance bottlenecks and derive performance-characterizing invariants for the given C program, we need to analyze the slow and fast inputs along with the respective hit counts for each line in the program.

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Comparison of Hit Counts:**
   - For line 21: The loop `for (long long int j = 1; j < c[i] + 1; j++)` is executed 200,002 times for the slow input but only 3 times for the fast input.
   - For lines 22 and 23: These lines are executed 200,000 times for the slow input but only once for the fast input.
   - Line 24: The condition `while (ptr < v[i].size() && v[i][ptr][0] == j)` is checked 200,002 times for the slow input but only 2 times for the fast input.

2. **Inference:**
   - The loop at line 21 iterates based on the number of coins or diamonds available (`c[i]`). This results in a high number of iterations when the values of `c[i]` are large.
   - The conditional checks and operations within the loop are significant contributors to the performance degradation for the slow input.
   - The loop complexity is problematic when `c[i]` is large, directly influencing the execution time.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **Invariant 1: High Iteration Count Due to Available Resources**
   - **Natural language description:** "When the number of coins or diamonds (`c[i]`) is large, the algorithm performs a high number of iterations, which can significantly slow down the execution."
   - **Reasoning:** The loop iterating up to `c[i]` + 1 causes the slow execution due to the large number of iterations. This is especially impactful when `c[i]` is at or near its maximum constraint.

2. **Invariant 2: Sorting and Data Preparation Overhead**
   - **Natural language description:** "If the available fountains list is large and sorted repeatedly for preparation, it can add overhead. This is exacerbated when resources (`c` and `d`) are high, leading to a large search space."
   - **Reasoning:** Sorting operations on `v[0]` and `v[1]` for large inputs (`n` near 100,000) can be costly, though the hit counts indicate more focus should be on the loop iterations.

3. **Invariant 3: Resource Exhaustion Without Successful Pairing**
   - **Natural language description:** "When attempting to maximize beauty with resources (`c[i]`) near constraints, the likelihood of finding a valid pair decreases, potentially leading to wasted computational effort without result."
   - **Reasoning:** Large resources without enough viable fountain pairs lead to the resource being exhausted in attempts without achieving a successful pair.

### Summary

The main source of the slowdown comes from the loop iterating over the potential costs of coins and diamonds (`c[0]` and `c[1]`). As `c[i]` increases, the number of iterations grows, and performance suffers. Sorting operations contribute to the overhead but are secondary to the iteration issue. The invariants reflect potential slowdowns due to large input constraints and high resource availability.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
Arkady plays Gardenscapes a lot. Arkady wants to build two new fountains. There are n available fountains, for each fountain its beauty and cost are known. There are two types of money in the game: coins and diamonds, so each fountain cost can be either in coins or diamonds. No money changes between the types are allowed.

Help Arkady to find two fountains with maximum total beauty so that he can buy both at the same time.

Input

The first line contains three integers n, c and d (2 ≤ n ≤ 100 000, 0 ≤ c, d ≤ 100 000) — the number of fountains, the number of coins and diamonds Arkady has.

The next n lines describe fountains. Each of these lines contain two integers bi and pi (1 ≤ bi, pi ≤ 100 000) — the beauty and the cost of the i-th fountain, and then a letter "C" or "D", describing in which type of money is the cost of fountain i: in coins or in diamonds, respectively.

Output

Print the maximum total beauty of exactly two fountains Arkady can build. If he can't build two fountains, print 0.

Examples

Input

3 7 6
10 8 C
4 3 C
5 6 D


Output

9


Input

2 4 5
2 5 C
2 1 D


Output

0


Input

3 10 10
5 5 C
5 5 C
10 11 D


Output

10

Note

In the first example Arkady should build the second fountain with beauty 4, which costs 3 coins. The first fountain he can't build because he don't have enough coins. Also Arkady should build the third fountain with beauty 5 which costs 6 diamonds. Thus the total beauty of built fountains is 9.

In the second example there are two fountains, but Arkady can't build both of them, because he needs 5 coins for the first fountain, and Arkady has only 4 coins.

assistant: ### Phase 3: Implement Invariants as C++ Checker Code

Let's convert the natural language invariants into C++ runtime checks:

#### Invariant 1: High Iteration Count Due to Available Resources
```cpp
void check_iteration_count(long long int coins, long long int diamonds) {
    if (coins > 10000 || diamonds > 10000) { // threshold adjusted to a reasonable value
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to high number of iterations triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

#### Invariant 2: Sorting and Data Preparation Overhead
```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(size_t size) {
    if (size > 50000) { // arbitrary threshold for heavy sorting
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to large sorting operation triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

#### Invariant 3: Resource Exhaustion Without Successful Pairing
```cpp
void check_resource_exhaustion(long long int coins, long long int diamonds, long long int n) {
    if ((coins == 100000 || diamonds == 100000) && n == 2) {
        cerr << "Warning: Resource exhaustion without successful pairing triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrate Checkers Into the Program

We'll integrate these checks into the given C++ program at appropriate points:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
long long int MAX = 2e5 + 1;
long long int mod = 998244353LL;
const string no = "NO", yes = "YES";

void check_iteration_count(long long int coins, long long int diamonds) {
    if (coins > 10000 || diamonds > 10000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to high number of iterations triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_sort_invariant(size_t size) {
    if (size > 50000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to large sorting operation triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_resource_exhaustion(long long int coins, long long int diamonds, long long int n) {
    if ((coins == 100000 || diamonds == 100000) && n == 2) {
        cerr << "Warning: Resource exhaustion without successful pairing triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void solve() {
    long long int n, c[2];
    cin >> n >> c[0] >> c[1];
    
    // Check for resource exhaustion invariant
    check_resource_exhaustion(c[0], c[1], n);
    
    vector<vector<long long int> > dp[2], v[2];
    for (long long int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        long long int b, p;
        char x;
        cin >> b >> p >> x;
        v[x - 'C'].push_back({p, b});
    }

    // Check for sorting invariant before sorting the vectors
    check_sort_invariant(v[0].size());
    check_sort_invariant(v[1].size());

    sort(v[0].begin(), v[0].end());
    sort(v[1].begin(), v[1].end());

    // Check for iteration count invariant before entering the loop
    check_iteration_count(c[0], c[1]);
    
    for (long long int i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
        dp[i].assign(c[i] + 1, vector<long long int>(2, -1e9));
        long long int ptr = 0;
        for (long long int j = 1; j < c[i] + 1; j++) {
            dp[i][j][0] = dp[i][j - 1][0];
            dp[i][j][1] = dp[i][j - 1][1];
            while (ptr < v[i].size() && v[i][ptr][0] == j) {
                long long int l = c[i] - j;
                l = min(l, j);
                if (dp[i][l][0] != -1e9) {
                    dp[i][j][1] = max(dp[i][j][1], v[i][ptr][1] + dp[i][l][0]);
                }
                dp[i][j][0] = max(dp[i][j][0], v[i][ptr][1]);
                ptr++;
            }
        }
    }
    
    long long int ans = 0;
    for (long long int i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
        ans = max(ans, dp[i][c[i]][1]);
    }
    ans = max(ans, dp[0][c[0]][0] + dp[1][c[1]][0]);
    cout << ans << "\n";
}

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);
    long long int t = 1;
    for (long long int i = 0; i < t; i++) {
        solve();
    }
}
```

### Explanation of Checks Inserted:

- **`check_iteration_count`:** Before the loop that runs based on resource limits (`c[0]` and `c[1]`), this check warns if the number of iterations will be excessive.
- **`check_sort_invariant`:** Before sorting the lists of fountains, this check ensures that sorting won't be too costly due to large input sizes.
- **`check_resource_exhaustion`:** Right after reading the inputs, this check warns if the resources are maximized but the number of fountains is minimal, which can imply a wasted attempt to find a pair.
