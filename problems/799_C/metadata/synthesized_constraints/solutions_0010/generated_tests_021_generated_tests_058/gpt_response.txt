=== Invariants Response ===
To diagnose the performance bottleneck in the given C program, let's go through the two phases as outlined.

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Comparison of Line-Level Hit Counts:**
   - **Lines with Significant Hit Differences:**
     - **Line 9:** `vector<int> vect(100007);` (slow: 2, fast: 0)
     - **Lines 10-12:** Building and using `vect` (slow: significant hits; fast: 0 hits).
     - **Lines 14-18:** Inner loop where combinations of fountains are checked (slow: 4 hits; fast: 0 hits).

2. **Analysis of Inefficient Code Segments:**
   - The `calc` function is called for both `coin_list` and `diamond_list`, but the loop within `calc` that checks combinations of fountains appears much more frequently in the slow case. This suggests that the inner loop (`for (j = 0; j < i; j++)`) is potentially costly.
   - The program uses a greedy strategy to compute the maximum sum of beauty values while checking availability constraints. The double loop structure here results in O(n^2) complexity, which could be costly given constraints.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the analysis, here are some performance-characterizing invariants in natural language that explain under what conditions the program slows down:

1. **Invariant 1: Large List with Repeated Combinations**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "If the number of fountains available for consideration (either coin-based or diamond-based) is large, and the maximum allowable cost is such that many combinations need to be tested, the nested loop may cause a slowdown."
   - **Reasoning:** The nested loop structure in `calc`, which checks pair combinations, becomes expensive as more fountains are available, especially since it operates at O(n^2).

2. **Invariant 2: Cost Thresholds Allow Extensive Searches**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "If the available coins or diamonds are close to the upper limit of possible fountain costs, more fountains will be considered, resulting in a larger search space and potential slowdowns."
   - **Reasoning:** When more fountains can be potentially purchased given the budget (c or d), the algorithm does more work to validate combinations.

3. **Invariant 3: Insufficient Constraints on Search Space**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "If there are insufficient constraints on the search space (e.g., many fountains are affordable but not combinable), the program will explore many suboptimal paths."
   - **Reasoning:** The function iteratively maximizes beauty while respecting costs. When many affordable combinations do not lead to valid purchases due to budget limits, computational resources are spent exploring these paths.

### Recommendations

- To avoid the nested loop slowness, consider optimizing the search logic, possibly by using more efficient data structures or heuristics to avoid unnecessary checks.
- Consider early exits when certain conditions are met (e.g., if a fountain combination cannot possibly be affordable given current constraints).
- Although the input constraint is n â‰¤ 100,000, the algorithm's quadratic nature (nested loop) makes it critical to manage list sizes effectively within practical limits.

## Phase 3: Implement Natural Language Invariants in C++

Let's translate the performance-characterizing invariants derived earlier into C++ code checkers.

### Invariant 1: Large List with Repeated Combinations

**Natural Language Description:** "If the number of fountains available for consideration (either coin-based or diamond-based) is large, and the maximum allowable cost is such that many combinations need to be tested, the nested loop may cause a slowdown."

**C++ Checker Code:**

```cpp
void check_large_list_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large list with repeated combinations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Invariant 2: Cost Thresholds Allow Extensive Searches

**Natural Language Description:** "If the available coins or diamonds are close to the upper limit of possible fountain costs, more fountains will be considered, resulting in a larger search space and potential slowdowns."

**C++ Checker Code:**

```cpp
void check_cost_threshold_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - cost thresholds allow extensive searches" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Invariant 3: Insufficient Constraints on Search Space

**Natural Language Description:** "If there are insufficient constraints on the search space (e.g., many fountains are affordable but not combinable), the program will explore many suboptimal paths."

**C++ Checker Code:**

```cpp
void check_insufficient_constraints_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - insufficient constraints on search space" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

## Phase 4: Propagate and Insert Conditional Checks

Now, let's integrate these checker functions into the provided C++ program.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int n, c, d, a, b, ans, cmax, dmax;
char type;
vector<pair<int, int>> coin_list, diamond_list;

// Performance checker functions
void check_large_list_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large list with repeated combinations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_cost_threshold_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - cost thresholds allow extensive searches" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_insufficient_constraints_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - insufficient constraints on search space" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void calc(vector<pair<int, int>> x, int avail) {
    int sz = x.size();
    if (sz < 2) return;

    // Check for large list condition
    check_large_list_invariant(sz > 1000);  // arbitrary threshold for demonstration

    vector<int> vect(100007);
    vect[0] = x[0].second;
    for (int i = 1; i < sz; i++) vect[i] = max(vect[i - 1], x[i].second);
    for (int i = sz - 1; i > 0; i--) {
        int j;
        for (j = 0; j < i; j++)
            if (x[i].first + x[j].first > avail) break;
        j -= 1;
        if (j - 1 == i) break;
        if (j >= 0) ans = max(ans, x[i].second + vect[j]);
    }
}

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);
    cin >> n >> c >> d;

    // Check for cost threshold condition
    check_cost_threshold_invariant(c > 90000 || d > 90000); // arbitrary high threshold

    while (n--) {
        cin >> a >> b >> type;
        if (type == 'C') {
            if (b > c) continue;
            coin_list.push_back(make_pair(b, a));
            cmax = max(cmax, a);
        } else {
            if (b > d) continue;
            diamond_list.push_back(make_pair(b, a));
            dmax = max(dmax, a);
        }
    }

    // Check for insufficient constraints on search space
    check_insufficient_constraints_invariant((coin_list.size() > 10) && (diamond_list.size() > 10)); // arbitrary combined condition

    sort(coin_list.begin(), coin_list.end());
    sort(diamond_list.begin(), diamond_list.end());
    calc(coin_list, c);
    calc(diamond_list, d);
    if (diamond_list.size() && coin_list.size()) ans = max(ans, cmax + dmax);
    cout << ans;
}
```

### Comments on Inserted Checks

1. **`check_large_list_invariant`:** This check is inserted in the `calc` function to detect when a large list might lead to extensive pair combination checks.

2. **`check_cost_threshold_invariant`:** Placed immediately after reading the inputs to detect situations where high budget thresholds could lead to inefficient searches.

3. **`check_insufficient_constraints_invariant`:** Added before sorting and calculating to identify cases where both lists are large enough to potentially explore too many suboptimal paths.
