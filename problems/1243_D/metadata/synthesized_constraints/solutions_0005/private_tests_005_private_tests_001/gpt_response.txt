### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Analyzing Hit Counts:**
   - The function `findpar()` is called significantly more in the slow input (80,698,990 times) compared to the fast input (8 times). This suggests that the Disjoint Set Union (DSU) operations are a major contributor to the slowdown.
   - The `unite()` function is also heavily involved in the slow input (20,099,799 times). This is linked to union operations in the DSU structure.
   - The loop that iterates through `v` in line 54 and then through `bad` in line 57 shows many hits (20,100,201 times), indicating repeated initialization and checks for every vertex.

2. **Performance Bottleneck Analysis:**
   - The algorithm is operating on a complete graph with `n` vertices, meaning it has `n(n-1)/2` edges, but it only processes the `m` edges with weight 1. When `m` is small or zero, the algorithm still processes many vertices without many actual edges to operate on.
   - The `findpar()` and `unite()` functions are working extensively because they are involved in checking and merging sets, even when there is minimal actual merging (as reflected by the calls to `findpar()`).

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **Invariant 1: Large Vertex Set with Minimal Edges**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "When the graph has a very large number of vertices with few or zero edges of weight 1, the algorithm spends excessive time processing many vertices without efficient merging of sets."
   - **Threshold Justification:** Given the input constraints (`1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000`), the condition focuses on scenarios where `n` is large but `m` is small (e.g., `m = 0`).

2. **Invariant 2: Extensive Union-Find Operations**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "If the union-find data structure undergoes many find or union operations without substantial merging, performance may degrade due to excessive recursive find operations."
   - **Threshold Justification:** Large `n` with minimal edges implies many checks and minimal merges, stressing DSU operations.

3. **Invariant 3: Redundant Checks in Sparse Graphs**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "In sparse graphs (low `m`) with large `n`, repeated initialization and checks on all vertices can result in performance degradation."
   - **Threshold Justification:** With `m` being small, every loop iteration through `v` results in unnecessary checks for vertices that do not contribute much to the solution in terms of merging.

By understanding these patterns and invariants, we can identify scenarios where performance issues are likely to occur and potentially optimize or refactor the code to avoid unnecessary operations. This ensures that the algorithm's behavior aligns with its expected efficiency, especially for edge cases within the defined constraints.

### Phase 3: Implementing the Natural Language Invariants in C++

Here are the C++ implementations of the performance-characterizing invariants derived in Phase 2:

```cpp
void check_large_vertices_few_edges(int n, int m) {
    if (n > 10000 && m < n / 10) {  // Condition: Large number of vertices with few edges
        cerr << "Warning: Large vertex set with minimal edges - potential inefficiency!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_extensive_union_find_operations(int ops, int n) {
    if (ops > 20 * n) {  // Condition: Many DSU operations relative to the number of vertices
        cerr << "Warning: Excessive union-find operations - potential inefficiency!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_redundant_checks_in_sparse_graphs(int n, int m) {
    if (n > 5000 && m < n / 5) {  // Condition: Sparse graph with large `n`
        cerr << "Warning: Redundant checks in sparse graphs - potential inefficiency!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrating Checker Code into the Original C++ Program

Below is the instrumented C++ code with the performance checks integrated:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

template <class T>
void print(const T niz[], const int siz) {
    for (int i = 0; i < siz; i++) cout << niz[i] << " ";
    cout << endl;
}

int n, m;
vector<int> graf[100005];
int dsu[100005];
int sajz[100005];

int findpar(int x) {
    if (x == dsu[x]) return x;
    return dsu[x] = findpar(dsu[x]);
}

void unite(int x, int y) {
    int a = findpar(x);
    int b = findpar(y);
    if (a == b) return;
    if (sajz[a] > sajz[b]) {
        dsu[a] = b;
        sajz[b] += sajz[a];
    } else {
        dsu[b] = a;
        sajz[a] += sajz[b];
    }
}

void init() {
    for (int(i) = (1); (i) <= (n); ++(i)) {
        dsu[i] = i;
        sajz[i] = 1;
    }
}

int deg[100005];
vector<pair<int, int> > v;
map<pair<int, int>, bool> poj;
bool bad[100005];

// Checker functions for performance bottlenecks
void check_large_vertices_few_edges(int n, int m) {
    if (n > 10000 && m < n / 10) {  // Condition: Large number of vertices with few edges
        cerr << "Warning: Large vertex set with minimal edges - potential inefficiency!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_extensive_union_find_operations(int ops, int n) {
    if (ops > 20 * n) {  // Condition: Many DSU operations relative to the number of vertices
        cerr << "Warning: Excessive union-find operations - potential inefficiency!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_redundant_checks_in_sparse_graphs(int n, int m) {
    if (n > 5000 && m < n / 5) {  // Condition: Sparse graph with large `n`
        cerr << "Warning: Redundant checks in sparse graphs - potential inefficiency!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin >> n >> m;

    // Performance checks based on input size
    check_large_vertices_few_edges(n, m);
    check_redundant_checks_in_sparse_graphs(n, m);

    init();
    for (int(i) = (0); (i) <= (m - 1); ++(i)) {
        int a, b;
        cin >> a >> b;
        graf[a].push_back(b);
        graf[b].push_back(a);
        deg[a]++;
        deg[b]++;
    }

    for (int(i) = (1); (i) <= (n); ++(i)) v.push_back({-deg[i], i});
    sort(v.begin(), v.end());

    int ops = 0;
    int sol = 0;

    for (auto c : v) {
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) bad[i] = 0;
        for (auto k : graf[c.second]) bad[k] = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            if (i == c.second || bad[i]) continue;
            unite(i, c.second);
        }
        ops += n;
        check_extensive_union_find_operations(ops, n);  // Check excessive DSU operations
        if (ops > 20000000) break;
    }

    for (int(i) = (1); (i) <= (n); ++(i))
        if (findpar(i) == i) sol++;

    cout << sol - 1 << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**
- **Checks** have been placed after reading inputs and before/after critical operations such as union-find loops.
- **Thresholds** are chosen to detect inefficiencies without relying on slow input specifics.
- **Abort** is used to stop execution if a performance bottleneck condition is detected, aiding in testing and debugging.
