system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

Ujan has a lot of useless stuff in his drawers, a considerable part of which are his math notebooks: it is time to sort them out. This time he found an old dusty graph theory notebook with a description of a graph.

It is an undirected weighted graph on n vertices. It is a complete graph: each pair of vertices is connected by an edge. The weight of each edge is either 0 or 1; exactly m edges have weight 1, and all others have weight 0.

Since Ujan doesn't really want to organize his notes, he decided to find the weight of the minimum spanning tree of the graph. (The weight of a spanning tree is the sum of all its edges.) Can you find the answer for Ujan so he stops procrastinating?

Input

The first line of the input contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ m ≤ min((n(n-1))/(2),10^5)), the number of vertices and the number of edges of weight 1 in the graph. 

The i-th of the next m lines contains two integers a_i and b_i (1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ n, a_i ≠ b_i), the endpoints of the i-th edge of weight 1.

It is guaranteed that no edge appears twice in the input.

Output

Output a single integer, the weight of the minimum spanning tree of the graph.

Note

The graph from the first sample is shown below. Dashed edges have weight 0, other edges have weight 1. One of the minimum spanning trees is highlighted in orange and has total weight 2.

In the second sample, all edges have weight 0 so any spanning tree has total weight 0.

assistant: ### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Analyzing Hit Counts:**
   - The function `findpar()` is called significantly more in the slow input (80,698,990 times) compared to the fast input (8 times). This suggests that the Disjoint Set Union (DSU) operations are a major contributor to the slowdown.
   - The `unite()` function is also heavily involved in the slow input (20,099,799 times). This is linked to union operations in the DSU structure.
   - The loop that iterates through `v` in line 54 and then through `bad` in line 57 shows many hits (20,100,201 times), indicating repeated initialization and checks for every vertex.

2. **Performance Bottleneck Analysis:**
   - The algorithm is operating on a complete graph with `n` vertices, meaning it has `n(n-1)/2` edges, but it only processes the `m` edges with weight 1. When `m` is small or zero, the algorithm still processes many vertices without many actual edges to operate on.
   - The `findpar()` and `unite()` functions are working extensively because they are involved in checking and merging sets, even when there is minimal actual merging (as reflected by the calls to `findpar()`).

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **Invariant 1: Large Vertex Set with Minimal Edges**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "When the graph has a very large number of vertices with few or zero edges of weight 1, the algorithm spends excessive time processing many vertices without efficient merging of sets."
   - **Threshold Justification:** Given the input constraints (`1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000`), the condition focuses on scenarios where `n` is large but `m` is small (e.g., `m = 0`).

2. **Invariant 2: Extensive Union-Find Operations**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "If the union-find data structure undergoes many find or union operations without substantial merging, performance may degrade due to excessive recursive find operations."
   - **Threshold Justification:** Large `n` with minimal edges implies many checks and minimal merges, stressing DSU operations.

3. **Invariant 3: Redundant Checks in Sparse Graphs**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "In sparse graphs (low `m`) with large `n`, repeated initialization and checks on all vertices can result in performance degradation."
   - **Threshold Justification:** With `m` being small, every loop iteration through `v` results in unnecessary checks for vertices that do not contribute much to the solution in terms of merging.

By understanding these patterns and invariants, we can identify scenarios where performance issues are likely to occur and potentially optimize or refactor the code to avoid unnecessary operations. This ensures that the algorithm's behavior aligns with its expected efficiency, especially for edge cases within the defined constraints.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
Ujan has a lot of useless stuff in his drawers, a considerable part of which are his math notebooks: it is time to sort them out. This time he found an old dusty graph theory notebook with a description of a graph.

It is an undirected weighted graph on n vertices. It is a complete graph: each pair of vertices is connected by an edge. The weight of each edge is either 0 or 1; exactly m edges have weight 1, and all others have weight 0.

Since Ujan doesn't really want to organize his notes, he decided to find the weight of the minimum spanning tree of the graph. (The weight of a spanning tree is the sum of all its edges.) Can you find the answer for Ujan so he stops procrastinating?

Input

The first line of the input contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ m ≤ min((n(n-1))/(2),10^5)), the number of vertices and the number of edges of weight 1 in the graph. 

The i-th of the next m lines contains two integers a_i and b_i (1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ n, a_i ≠ b_i), the endpoints of the i-th edge of weight 1.

It is guaranteed that no edge appears twice in the input.

Output

Output a single integer, the weight of the minimum spanning tree of the graph.

Examples

Input


3 0


Output


0

Note

The graph from the first sample is shown below. Dashed edges have weight 0, other edges have weight 1. One of the minimum spanning trees is highlighted in orange and has total weight 2.

In the second sample, all edges have weight 0 so any spanning tree has total weight 0.

assistant: ### Phase 3: Implementing the Natural Language Invariants in C++

Here are the C++ implementations of the performance-characterizing invariants derived in Phase 2:

```cpp
void check_large_vertices_few_edges(int n, int m) {
    if (n > 10000 && m < n / 10) {  // Condition: Large number of vertices with few edges
        cerr << "Warning: Large vertex set with minimal edges - potential inefficiency!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_extensive_union_find_operations(int ops, int n) {
    if (ops > 20 * n) {  // Condition: Many DSU operations relative to the number of vertices
        cerr << "Warning: Excessive union-find operations - potential inefficiency!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_redundant_checks_in_sparse_graphs(int n, int m) {
    if (n > 5000 && m < n / 5) {  // Condition: Sparse graph with large `n`
        cerr << "Warning: Redundant checks in sparse graphs - potential inefficiency!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrating Checker Code into the Original C++ Program

Below is the instrumented C++ code with the performance checks integrated:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

template <class T>
void print(const T niz[], const int siz) {
    for (int i = 0; i < siz; i++) cout << niz[i] << " ";
    cout << endl;
}

int n, m;
vector<int> graf[100005];
int dsu[100005];
int sajz[100005];

int findpar(int x) {
    if (x == dsu[x]) return x;
    return dsu[x] = findpar(dsu[x]);
}

void unite(int x, int y) {
    int a = findpar(x);
    int b = findpar(y);
    if (a == b) return;
    if (sajz[a] > sajz[b]) {
        dsu[a] = b;
        sajz[b] += sajz[a];
    } else {
        dsu[b] = a;
        sajz[a] += sajz[b];
    }
}

void init() {
    for (int(i) = (1); (i) <= (n); ++(i)) {
        dsu[i] = i;
        sajz[i] = 1;
    }
}

int deg[100005];
vector<pair<int, int> > v;
map<pair<int, int>, bool> poj;
bool bad[100005];

// Checker functions for performance bottlenecks
void check_large_vertices_few_edges(int n, int m) {
    if (n > 10000 && m < n / 10) {  // Condition: Large number of vertices with few edges
        cerr << "Warning: Large vertex set with minimal edges - potential inefficiency!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_extensive_union_find_operations(int ops, int n) {
    if (ops > 20 * n) {  // Condition: Many DSU operations relative to the number of vertices
        cerr << "Warning: Excessive union-find operations - potential inefficiency!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_redundant_checks_in_sparse_graphs(int n, int m) {
    if (n > 5000 && m < n / 5) {  // Condition: Sparse graph with large `n`
        cerr << "Warning: Redundant checks in sparse graphs - potential inefficiency!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin >> n >> m;

    // Performance checks based on input size
    check_large_vertices_few_edges(n, m);
    check_redundant_checks_in_sparse_graphs(n, m);

    init();
    for (int(i) = (0); (i) <= (m - 1); ++(i)) {
        int a, b;
        cin >> a >> b;
        graf[a].push_back(b);
        graf[b].push_back(a);
        deg[a]++;
        deg[b]++;
    }

    for (int(i) = (1); (i) <= (n); ++(i)) v.push_back({-deg[i], i});
    sort(v.begin(), v.end());

    int ops = 0;
    int sol = 0;

    for (auto c : v) {
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) bad[i] = 0;
        for (auto k : graf[c.second]) bad[k] = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            if (i == c.second || bad[i]) continue;
            unite(i, c.second);
        }
        ops += n;
        check_extensive_union_find_operations(ops, n);  // Check excessive DSU operations
        if (ops > 20000000) break;
    }

    for (int(i) = (1); (i) <= (n); ++(i))
        if (findpar(i) == i) sol++;

    cout << sol - 1 << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**
- **Checks** have been placed after reading inputs and before/after critical operations such as union-find loops.
- **Thresholds** are chosen to detect inefficiencies without relying on slow input specifics.
- **Abort** is used to stop execution if a performance bottleneck condition is detected, aiding in testing and debugging.
