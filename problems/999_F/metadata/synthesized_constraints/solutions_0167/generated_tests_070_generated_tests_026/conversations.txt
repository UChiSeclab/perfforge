system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

There are n players sitting at the card table. Each player has a favorite number. The favorite number of the j-th player is f_j.

There are k ⋅ n cards on the table. Each card contains a single integer: the i-th card contains number c_i. Also, you are given a sequence h_1, h_2, ..., h_k. Its meaning will be explained below.

The players have to distribute all the cards in such a way that each of them will hold exactly k cards. After all the cards are distributed, each player counts the number of cards he has that contains his favorite number. The joy level of a player equals h_t if the player holds t cards containing his favorite number. If a player gets no cards with his favorite number (i.e., t=0), his joy level is 0.

Print the maximum possible total joy levels of the players after the cards are distributed. Note that the sequence h_1, ..., h_k is the same for all the players.

Input

The first line of input contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 500, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10) — the number of players and the number of cards each player will get.

The second line contains k ⋅ n integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_{k ⋅ n} (1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^5) — the numbers written on the cards.

The third line contains n integers f_1, f_2, ..., f_n (1 ≤ f_j ≤ 10^5) — the favorite numbers of the players.

The fourth line contains k integers h_1, h_2, ..., h_k (1 ≤ h_t ≤ 10^5), where h_t is the joy level of a player if he gets exactly t cards with his favorite number written on them. It is guaranteed that the condition h_{t - 1} < h_t holds for each t ∈ [2..k].

Output

Print one integer — the maximum possible total joy levels of the players among all possible card distributions.

Output

Note

In the first example, one possible optimal card distribution is the following:

  * Player 1 gets cards with numbers [1, 3, 8]; 
  * Player 2 gets cards with numbers [2, 2, 8]; 
  * Player 3 gets cards with numbers [2, 2, 8]; 
  * Player 4 gets cards with numbers [5, 5, 5]. 



Thus, the answer is 2 + 6 + 6 + 7 = 21.

In the second example, no player can get a card with his favorite number. Thus, the answer is 0.

(F) Program Solving the Problem Statement

  int cur = 0, cnt = 0;
  cur = max(cur, solve(in + 1, st));

    if (c[i] == fa[in]) {
      cnt++;
      cur = max(cur, solve(in + 1, i + 1) + h[cnt]);
      if (cnt == k) break;
    }
  }

  cout << solve(1, 1);
  return 0;
}

assistant: ### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Comparison of Line-Level Hit Counts**:
   - **Line 4 (`solve` function declaration)**: The `solve` function is called 486 times for the slow input, compared to just 2 times for the fast input.
   - **Line 10 (for loop)**: The loop iterates 6142 times in the slow input, compared to 2 times in the fast input.
   - **Line 12 (conditional checking `c[i] == fa[in]`)**: This condition is evaluated 5851 times for the slow input, but only once for the fast input.
   - **Lines 13-15 (increment `cnt`, recursive call, and `if` check)**: The operations within this block are executed 97 times in the slow input, but not at all in the fast input.

2. **Inference**:
   - The `solve` function's recursive nature results in a high number of calls for the slow input, significantly increasing hit counts.
   - The nested loop and condition checking (`c[i] == fa[in]`) are costly, particularly because they iterate over a potentially large array of cards, combined with recursion.
   - The lines within the loop (13-15) indicate repeated evaluations when players are checking for cards matching their favorite numbers.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **Invariant 1: Recursive Depth and Card Matching**:
   - **Natural Language Statement**: "If the number of players and the number of cards distributed per player are both close to their maximum limits, and if there are many cards with numbers matching players' favorite numbers, the recursion depth and the number of operations for matching cause the execution to slow down."

2. **Invariant 2: High Iteration in Card Matching**:
   - **Natural Language Statement**: "When the list of cards contains many duplicates, particularly those matching the players' favorite numbers, the inner loop that checks and counts these matches triggers a slowdown due to excessive iteration and computation."

3. **Invariant 3: Dynamic Programming Table Size**:
   - **Natural Language Statement**: "The program uses a dynamic programming approach with a potential maximum table size of f[505][5005]. If this table is filled extensively due to recursive calls and checks, it can lead to inefficiencies and increased computation time."

### Final Considerations

- These invariants are designed to capture scenarios where the program exhibits increased computational paths due to input patterns, such as player and card configurations that lead to deep recursion and high iteration counts.
- Avoiding exact numerical dependencies ensures these invariants capture a broad range of potential future slow inputs, adhering to the constraints of the problem.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
There are n players sitting at the card table. Each player has a favorite number. The favorite number of the j-th player is f_j.

There are k ⋅ n cards on the table. Each card contains a single integer: the i-th card contains number c_i. Also, you are given a sequence h_1, h_2, ..., h_k. Its meaning will be explained below.

The players have to distribute all the cards in such a way that each of them will hold exactly k cards. After all the cards are distributed, each player counts the number of cards he has that contains his favorite number. The joy level of a player equals h_t if the player holds t cards containing his favorite number. If a player gets no cards with his favorite number (i.e., t=0), his joy level is 0.

Print the maximum possible total joy levels of the players after the cards are distributed. Note that the sequence h_1, ..., h_k is the same for all the players.

Input

The first line of input contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 500, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10) — the number of players and the number of cards each player will get.

The second line contains k ⋅ n integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_{k ⋅ n} (1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^5) — the numbers written on the cards.

The third line contains n integers f_1, f_2, ..., f_n (1 ≤ f_j ≤ 10^5) — the favorite numbers of the players.

The fourth line contains k integers h_1, h_2, ..., h_k (1 ≤ h_t ≤ 10^5), where h_t is the joy level of a player if he gets exactly t cards with his favorite number written on them. It is guaranteed that the condition h_{t - 1} < h_t holds for each t ∈ [2..k].

Output

Print one integer — the maximum possible total joy levels of the players among all possible card distributions.

Examples

Input

4 3
1 3 2 8 5 5 8 2 2 8 5 2
1 2 2 5
2 6 7


Output

21


Input

3 3
9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9
1 2 3
1 2 3


Output

0

Note

In the first example, one possible optimal card distribution is the following:

  * Player 1 gets cards with numbers [1, 3, 8]; 
  * Player 2 gets cards with numbers [2, 2, 8]; 
  * Player 3 gets cards with numbers [2, 2, 8]; 
  * Player 4 gets cards with numbers [5, 5, 5]. 



Thus, the answer is 2 + 6 + 6 + 7 = 21.

In the second example, no player can get a card with his favorite number. Thus, the answer is 0.

Solution (C++ code):
{solution}


assistant: ### Phase 3: Implementing Natural Language Invariants in C++

Below are the checker functions implemented based on the performance-characterizing invariants derived previously:

1. **Invariant 1: Recursive Depth and Card Matching**
   - **Checker Code**: This invariant is about the recursion depth and the setup with players and cards. We'll check if the combination of `n` and `k` encourages deep recursion.
   
   ```cpp
   void check_recursive_depth_invariant(int recursionDepth, int threshold) {
       if (recursionDepth > threshold) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to excessive recursion depth!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Invariant 2: High Iteration in Card Matching**
   - **Checker Code**: This invariant checks for excessive card matching iterations, which suggests many duplicate matches.
   
   ```cpp
   void check_iteration_invariant(int iterations, int threshold) {
       if (iterations > threshold) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to excessive card match iterations!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Invariant 3: Dynamic Programming Table Size**
   - **Checker Code**: This invariant checks for excessive filling of the dynamic programming table.
   
   ```cpp
   void check_dp_table_invariant(int tableUsage, int threshold) {
       if (tableUsage > threshold) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to excessive dynamic programming table usage!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Integrating Checker Code into the Original Program

In this phase, we'll integrate the checker functions into the existing C++ code, placing them strategically to monitor conditions without adding overhead in tight loops.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int n, k, c[5005], fa[505], h[15], f[505][5005];

void check_recursive_depth_invariant(int recursionDepth, int threshold) {
    if (recursionDepth > threshold) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to excessive recursion depth!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_iteration_invariant(int iterations, int threshold) {
    if (iterations > threshold) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to excessive card match iterations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_dp_table_invariant(int tableUsage, int threshold) {
    if (tableUsage > threshold) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to excessive dynamic programming table usage!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int solve(int in, int st) {
    static int recursionDepth = 0;
    static int iterationCount = 0;
    recursionDepth++;

    check_recursive_depth_invariant(recursionDepth, 500); // Example threshold for recursion depth

    if (in == n + 1) {
        recursionDepth--;
        return 0;
    }
    if (st == n * k + 1) {
        recursionDepth--;
        return 0;
    }
    if (f[in][st] != -1) {
        recursionDepth--;
        return f[in][st];
    }

    int cur = 0, cnt = 0;
    cur = max(cur, solve(in + 1, st));

    for (int i = st; i <= n * k; i++) {
        iterationCount++;
        check_iteration_invariant(iterationCount, 10000); // Example threshold for iterations

        if (c[i] > fa[in]) break;
        if (c[i] == fa[in]) {
            cnt++;
            cur = max(cur, solve(in + 1, i + 1) + h[cnt]);
            if (cnt == k) break;
        }
    }
    
    check_dp_table_invariant(f[in][st], 1000000); // Example threshold for DP table usage
    f[in][st] = cur;

    recursionDepth--;
    return cur;
}

int main() {
    ios::sync_with_stdio(0);
    cin.tie(0);

    cin >> n >> k;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n * k; i++) cin >> c[i];
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) cin >> fa[i];
    for (int i = 1; i <= k; i++) cin >> h[i];

    sort(c + 1, c + n * k + 1);
    sort(fa + 1, fa + n + 1);
    
    memset(f, -1, sizeof f);
    cout << solve(1, 1);
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

- **Recursive Depth Check**: We added a static `recursionDepth` variable to track the current recursion depth and inserted a check after each recursive call in the `solve` function.
- **Iteration Count Check**: We track the number of iterations in the loop within the `solve` function and inserted a check to detect excessive iterations.
- **Dynamic Programming Table Usage Check**: We inserted a check to ensure the dynamic programming table is not excessively filled, based on a threshold.

These checks are placed outside of the tightest loops and critical paths, minimizing the performance impact while effectively capturing potential bottleneck conditions.
