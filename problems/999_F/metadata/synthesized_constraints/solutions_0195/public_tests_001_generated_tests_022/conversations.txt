system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

There are n players sitting at the card table. Each player has a favorite number. The favorite number of the j-th player is f_j.

There are k ⋅ n cards on the table. Each card contains a single integer: the i-th card contains number c_i. Also, you are given a sequence h_1, h_2, ..., h_k. Its meaning will be explained below.

The players have to distribute all the cards in such a way that each of them will hold exactly k cards. After all the cards are distributed, each player counts the number of cards he has that contains his favorite number. The joy level of a player equals h_t if the player holds t cards containing his favorite number. If a player gets no cards with his favorite number (i.e., t=0), his joy level is 0.

Print the maximum possible total joy levels of the players after the cards are distributed. Note that the sequence h_1, ..., h_k is the same for all the players.

Input

The first line of input contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 500, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10) — the number of players and the number of cards each player will get.

The second line contains k ⋅ n integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_{k ⋅ n} (1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^5) — the numbers written on the cards.

The third line contains n integers f_1, f_2, ..., f_n (1 ≤ f_j ≤ 10^5) — the favorite numbers of the players.

The fourth line contains k integers h_1, h_2, ..., h_k (1 ≤ h_t ≤ 10^5), where h_t is the joy level of a player if he gets exactly t cards with his favorite number written on them. It is guaranteed that the condition h_{t - 1} < h_t holds for each t ∈ [2..k].

Output

Print one integer — the maximum possible total joy levels of the players among all possible card distributions.

Examples

Input

4 3
1 3 2 8 5 5 8 2 2 8 5 2
1 2 2 5
2 6 7


Output

21


Input

3 3
9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9
1 2 3
1 2 3


Output

0

Note

In the first example, one possible optimal card distribution is the following:

  * Player 1 gets cards with numbers [1, 3, 8]; 
  * Player 2 gets cards with numbers [2, 2, 8]; 
  * Player 3 gets cards with numbers [2, 2, 8]; 
  * Player 4 gets cards with numbers [5, 5, 5]. 



Thus, the answer is 2 + 6 + 6 + 7 = 21.

In the second example, no player can get a card with his favorite number. Thus, the answer is 0.

assistant: To diagnose the performance bottleneck in the given C program and derive performance-characterizing invariants, let's break down the phases:

### Phase 1: Identifying Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Compare Line-Level Hit Counts**: 
   - The `init()` function has a loop structure that is heavily executed. Specifically, lines within this function, particularly the nested loop starting at line 25, are hit significantly more often for the slow input compared to the fast input.
   - Line 29, which updates `maxx` using `dp[i-1][q][k-j]`, and line 31, which computes `dp[i][j][k]`, are notably more active in the slow input.

2. **Pinpoint Lines or Functions with More Hits**:
   - **`init()` Function**: The loops in this function, especially the nested loop structure (lines 23-34), are a focal point due to their high hit counts. This function is heavily relied upon for each input configuration, and the depth and breadth of the iterations increase with the size of `k` and `n`.

3. **Infer Interaction with Data Structures or Control Flow**:
   - The problem involves dynamic programming (DP) with a 3D DP table (`dp[i][j][k]`), suggesting that the looping structure is related to computing maximum joy levels for different configurations of card allocations.
   - The loops are iterating over potential card distributions, and the conditions within the `for` loops directly impact the number of iterations, especially given how `j` and `k` influence break conditions and depth of nested loops.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the observations from Phase 1, here are some performance-characterizing invariants in natural language, describing conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path:

1. **Invariant #1**: 
   - **Description**: "The performance degrades significantly when the number of players (`n`) is high and each player must receive a large number of cards (`k`) because it increases the state space the algorithm needs to explore in the dynamic programming table."
   - **Explanation**: As `n` and `k` increase, there are more potential distributions of favorite numbers, leading to more states in the DP table that must be computed, thus increasing time complexity exponentially.

2. **Invariant #2**:
   - **Description**: "When the diversity of card numbers (`c_i`) is high and closely matches the favorite numbers (`f_j`) of the players, the computation of joy levels requires more iterations, as there are many valid configurations to evaluate."
   - **Explanation**: A higher number of matching card numbers to favorite numbers leads to more combinations to check for maximizing the joy levels, increasing the workload of the nested loop.

3. **Invariant #3**:
   - **Description**: "The computation becomes slow when there are many unique favorite numbers, requiring the program to fill a large portion of the dynamic programming table with calculated values."
   - **Explanation**: Diverse favorite numbers mean more unique entries in the map `p` and corresponding entries in `cnt`, leading to more iterations over potential configurations per player.

4. **Invariant #4**:
   - **Description**: "A nested loop iterating through potential card allocations becomes a bottleneck when the number of favorite numbers (`n`) and the number of cards to distribute (`k`) per player is high, as it leads to large iteration counts over the DP table."
   - **Explanation**: The loops' depth and complexity are directly tied to `n` and `k`, thus increasing exponentially with these values, which can be seen in the hit counts of lines inside the `init()` function. 

By understanding these conditions, one can identify scenarios that lead to slow execution, such as large values of `n` and `k`, high diversity in card numbers, and complex configurations of joy levels. These insights can guide further optimizations, such as reducing unnecessary computations or efficiently pruning the search space.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
There are n players sitting at the card table. Each player has a favorite number. The favorite number of the j-th player is f_j.

There are k ⋅ n cards on the table. Each card contains a single integer: the i-th card contains number c_i. Also, you are given a sequence h_1, h_2, ..., h_k. Its meaning will be explained below.

The players have to distribute all the cards in such a way that each of them will hold exactly k cards. After all the cards are distributed, each player counts the number of cards he has that contains his favorite number. The joy level of a player equals h_t if the player holds t cards containing his favorite number. If a player gets no cards with his favorite number (i.e., t=0), his joy level is 0.

Print the maximum possible total joy levels of the players after the cards are distributed. Note that the sequence h_1, ..., h_k is the same for all the players.

Input

The first line of input contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 500, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10) — the number of players and the number of cards each player will get.

The second line contains k ⋅ n integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_{k ⋅ n} (1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^5) — the numbers written on the cards.

The third line contains n integers f_1, f_2, ..., f_n (1 ≤ f_j ≤ 10^5) — the favorite numbers of the players.

The fourth line contains k integers h_1, h_2, ..., h_k (1 ≤ h_t ≤ 10^5), where h_t is the joy level of a player if he gets exactly t cards with his favorite number written on them. It is guaranteed that the condition h_{t - 1} < h_t holds for each t ∈ [2..k].

Output

Print one integer — the maximum possible total joy levels of the players among all possible card distributions.

Examples

Input

4 3
1 3 2 8 5 5 8 2 2 8 5 2
1 2 2 5
2 6 7


Output

21


Input

3 3
9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9
1 2 3
1 2 3


Output

0

Note

In the first example, one possible optimal card distribution is the following:

  * Player 1 gets cards with numbers [1, 3, 8]; 
  * Player 2 gets cards with numbers [2, 2, 8]; 
  * Player 3 gets cards with numbers [2, 2, 8]; 
  * Player 4 gets cards with numbers [5, 5, 5]. 



Thus, the answer is 2 + 6 + 6 + 7 = 21.

In the second example, no player can get a card with his favorite number. Thus, the answer is 0.

Solution (C++ code):

assistant: Let's go through the process of implementing the performance-characterizing invariants as runtime checks in C++. We'll tackle this in two phases as instructed.

### Phase 3: Implementing Natural Language Invariants into C++ Checkers

Based on the natural language invariants identified:

1. **Invariant on number of players and cards**:
   - **Condition**: The performance may degrade when the number of players `n` is high and each player receives a large number of cards `k`.

2. **Invariant on diversity of card numbers**:
   - **Condition**: A large variety of card numbers that closely match a variety of favorite numbers might lead to a complex state space to explore.

3. **Invariant on unique favorite numbers**:
   - **Condition**: A high number of unique favorite numbers will require more computation due to increased dynamic programming table usage.

Let's implement these as runtime checks:

```cpp
void check_player_card_invariant(int n, int k) {
    if (n > 400 && k > 8) { // Example thresholds based on problem constraints
        cerr << "Warning: Too many players with too many cards each - potential performance bottleneck!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_card_diversity_invariant(const map<int, int>& cnt, int n) {
    if (cnt.size() > n * 3) { // Assuming high diversity if unique card numbers exceed three times the number of players
        cerr << "Warning: High card diversity relative to number of players - potential performance bottleneck!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_favorite_diversity_invariant(const map<int, int>& p) {
    if (p.size() > 300) { // Example threshold for favorite number diversity
        cerr << "Warning: High diversity of favorite numbers - potential performance bottleneck!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrating Checkers into the Program

We'll integrate these checks into the original program at appropriate points to capture performance bottlenecks during execution.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

void guan() {
    ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);
    cout.tie(NULL);
}

const int maxn = 100010;
const long long mod = 1e9 + 7;
const double pi = acos(-1.0);
const long long maxx = 1LL << 61;
const double eps = 1e-7;
int n, k;
inline int read() { return cin >> n >> k ? 1 : 0; }
int dp[510][12][5100];
int h[555], f[555];
map<int, int> cnt;
map<int, int> p;

void init() {
    int tk = k;
    memset(dp, 0, sizeof(dp));
    for (int i = 0; i <= 10; i++) dp[0][i][0] = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= 505; i++) {
        for (int k = 1; k <= 5010; ++k) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= tk; j++) {
                int maxx = 0;
                if (j > k) break;
                for (int q = 1; q <= j; q++) {
                    maxx = max(dp[i - 1][q][k - j], maxx);
                }
                dp[i][j][k] = h[j] + maxx;
            }
        }
    }
}

void check_player_card_invariant(int n, int k) {
    if (n > 400 && k > 8) { // Example thresholds based on problem constraints
        cerr << "Warning: Too many players with too many cards each - potential performance bottleneck!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_card_diversity_invariant(const map<int, int>& cnt, int n) {
    if (cnt.size() > n * 3) { // Assuming high diversity if unique card numbers exceed three times the number of players
        cerr << "Warning: High card diversity relative to number of players - potential performance bottleneck!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_favorite_diversity_invariant(const map<int, int>& p) {
    if (p.size() > 300) { // Example threshold for favorite number diversity
        cerr << "Warning: High diversity of favorite numbers - potential performance bottleneck!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void solve() {
    for (int i = 1; i <= k * n; i++) {
        int t;
        cin >> t;
        cnt[t]++;
    }

    check_card_diversity_invariant(cnt, n); // Check card diversity after reading inputs

    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        cin >> f[i];
        p[f[i]]++;
    }
    
    check_favorite_diversity_invariant(p); // Check favorite number diversity

    for (int i = 1; i <= k; i++) cin >> h[i];

    init();

    int ans = 0;
    for (map<int, int>::iterator it = p.begin(); it != p.end(); ++it) {
        int nump = it->second, sum = cnt[it->first];
        sum = min(sum, nump * k);
        int maxx = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= k; i++) {
            maxx = max(maxx, dp[nump][i][sum]);
        }
        ans += maxx;
    }
    cout << ans << endl;
}

int main() {
    guan();
    int t = 1;
    while (t--) {
        while (read()) {
            check_player_card_invariant(n, k); // Check player-card invariant after reading n and k
            solve();
        }
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of Check Insertions:

- **`check_player_card_invariant(n, k)`**: Placed immediately after reading `n` and `k` to catch any potential bottlenecks due to high values before proceeding.
  
- **`check_card_diversity_invariant(cnt, n)`**: Called after populating the `cnt` map to assess the diversity of card numbers relative to the number of players.

- **`check_favorite_diversity_invariant(p)`**: Invoked after populating the `p` map to evaluate the variety of favorite numbers among players.

These checks are strategically placed to preemptively catch situations leading to performance degradation without incurring additional overhead during the main computation.
