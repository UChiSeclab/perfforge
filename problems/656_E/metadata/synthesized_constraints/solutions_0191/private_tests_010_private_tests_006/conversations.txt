system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

You are given a complete undirected graph. For each pair of vertices you are given the length of the edge that connects them. Find the shortest paths between each pair of vertices in the graph and return the length of the longest of them.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer N (3 ≤ N ≤ 10).

The following N lines each contain N space-separated integers. jth integer in ith line aij is the length of the edge that connects vertices i and j. aij = aji, aii = 0, 1 ≤ aij ≤ 100 for i ≠ j.

Output

Output the maximum length of the shortest path between any pair of vertices in the graph.

assistant: ### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Comparison of Line-Level Hit Counts:**
   - The function `take()` (line 8) is called 11,000 times for the slow input, compared to just 108 times for the fast input.
   - `calc()` (line 12) is called 1,010 times for the slow input, compared to just 30 times for the fast input.
   - `floyd()` (line 16) is entered 11 times for the slow input, compared to just 4 times for the fast input.

2. **Pinpointing High Hit Count Lines:**
   - **Line 10**: This line is responsible for the recursive calls in `take()`, which occurs 21,000 times for the slow input in total. The recursive nature with the high hit count suggests that it's a critical bottleneck, given the nested recursion involved in computing shortest paths.
   - **Line 14**: The call to `take()` inside `calc()` is hit 1010 times, which suggests a potentially deep recursion or many iterations are being done even for calculating small distances.

3. **Inference on Interaction with Data Structures and Loops:**
   - The recursive call structure in `take()` is deeply nested, with additional combinatorial complexity due to its nature of checking paths through multiple intermediate nodes, which grows significantly with `n`.
   - As `n` approaches the upper limit (10), the multiplication of recursive calls becomes significant, which is exacerbated by a highly connected graph with varied weights.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **Natural Language Performance Invariants:**
   - **Invariant 1:** "If the graph contains edges with significantly varying weights, particularly if an edge has a much larger weight compared to others, the recursive calculation of shortest paths may become expensive due to multiple re-evaluations of potential paths."
   - **Invariant 2:** "When the vertex count `n` approaches its maximum allowed value (10 in this scenario), the recursive path computation can become a bottleneck as the number of possible intermediate vertex combinations increases, leading to excessive recursion depth."
   - **Invariant 3:** "If the recursive function used to calculate shortest paths is called with high frequency due to complex path dynamics (e.g., many possible intermediate paths), the performance may degrade significantly due to the high combinatorial complexity."

2. **Conditions Leading to Slow Path Entry:**
   - The presence of a very high weight edge (e.g., 100), which creates a disparity in path evaluations.
   - Near maximum vertex count `n` triggering a high number of recursive evaluations.
   - Many paths with similar weights causing re-evaluation of the same combinations of paths multiple times.

These statements aim to abstractly characterize the performance bottlenecks without relying on specific numeric values but instead focusing on patterns that lead to slow execution given the constraints of the problem. The identified conditions can guide in testing or identifying scenarios where similar slowdowns might occur.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
You are given a complete undirected graph. For each pair of vertices you are given the length of the edge that connects them. Find the shortest paths between each pair of vertices in the graph and return the length of the longest of them.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer N (3 ≤ N ≤ 10).

The following N lines each contain N space-separated integers. jth integer in ith line aij is the length of the edge that connects vertices i and j. aij = aji, aii = 0, 1 ≤ aij ≤ 100 for i ≠ j.

Output

Output the maximum length of the shortest path between any pair of vertices in the graph.

assistant: ### Phase 3: Implementing Natural Language Invariants in C++

Let's translate each of the previously derived natural language performance invariants into C++ code checks:

#### Invariant 1:
Condition: "If the graph contains edges with significantly varying weights, particularly if an edge has a much larger weight compared to others, the recursive calculation of shortest paths may become expensive."

```cpp
void check_edge_weight_variation(int maxWeight, int minWeight) {
    if (maxWeight > 10 * minWeight) {  // Example condition.
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to high edge weight variation!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

#### Invariant 2:
Condition: "When the vertex count `n` approaches its maximum allowed value (10 in this scenario), the recursive path computation can become a bottleneck."

```cpp
void check_vertex_count_invariant(int vertexCount) {
    if (vertexCount >= 10) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to maximum vertex count!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

#### Invariant 3:
Condition: "If the recursive function `take` is called with high frequency due to complex path dynamics, the performance may degrade significantly."

```cpp
void check_recursive_call_frequency(int callCount) {
    if (callCount > 10000) {  // Arbitrary threshold for demonstration.
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to high recursion frequency!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrating Checkers into the C++ Program

Now, let's integrate these checks into the original C++ program. We'll place these checks at appropriate locations to ensure they do not add overhead to tight loops.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
const int N = 200005;
long long inf = 1e15;
int n;
long long a[12][12];
long long dp[12][12][12];

void check_edge_weight_variation(int maxWeight, int minWeight) {
    if (maxWeight > 10 * minWeight) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to high edge weight variation!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_vertex_count_invariant(int vertexCount) {
    if (vertexCount >= 10) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to maximum vertex count!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_recursive_call_frequency(int callCount) {
    if (callCount > 10000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to high recursion frequency!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

### Explanation of Integration:

- **Edge Weight Variation Check:** It's placed after reading inputs to immediately assess weight disparities.
- **Vertex Count Check:** It's placed right after reading `n` to warn about high vertex counts.
- **Recursive Call Frequency Check:** It's integrated within the `take()` function to monitor recursive call counts. The call count thresholds are based on general observations about performance; these may need adjustment based on empirical testing.
