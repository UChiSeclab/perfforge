### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

Upon analyzing the hit count information, several observations about the program's performance can be made:

1. **Cycle Function Usage**: The `cycle` function is a recursive construct used to mimic loop behavior due to keyword restrictions. It is heavily utilized, with significant hit counts, particularly in nested calls, indicating that this is a key area affecting performance.

2. **Floyd-Warshall Algorithm**: The innermost `cycle` on line 32 is effectively executing a triple nested loop typical of the Floyd-Warshall algorithm for finding shortest paths. This segment is hit 11,110 times for the slow input compared to 120 times for the fast input. The difference in hit counts between the slow and fast inputs here is substantial and is a clear indicator of where performance bottlenecks occur.

3. **Matrix Operations**: The operations involving the `mm` matrix, particularly the update `mm[i][j] = min(mm[i][j], m[i][k] + m[k][j])`, are expensive due to their O(N^3) complexity typical in all-pairs shortest paths computation.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the analysis of the code and its behavior with different inputs, here are the performance-characterizing invariants:

1. **Invariant on Input Size and Nested Computation**:
   - **Natural Language Description**: "When the number of vertices \( n \) is at its maximum constraint and the graph has edges with high weights, the Floyd-Warshall algorithm will perform many iterations across the matrix, causing a potential slowdown. This is especially true when there is a high variance in path lengths, leading to extensive re-calculations."
   - **Rationale**: The maximum constraint \( n = 10 \) leads to \( 10^3 \) iterations in the worst case, which exponentially increases with any additional complexity in path recalculations due to edge weight.

2. **Invariant on Recursive Function Calls**:
   - **Natural Language Description**: "The recursive invocation of the `cycle` function inherently incurs additional computational overhead. When deeply nested, as seen in the repeated matrix updates, this can significantly slow down execution."
   - **Rationale**: Recursion is inherently slower than iteration due to function call overheads, especially when compounded by the need to handle complex operations like matrix updates.

3. **Invariant on Edge Weight Distributions**:
   - **Natural Language Description**: "In scenarios where there exist large discrepancies in edge weights (e.g., a very large edge weight compared to others), the algorithm may spend considerable time updating potential path lengths, leading to performance degradation."
   - **Rationale**: Large disparities in edge weights, like the 100 in the slow input, cause many re-evaluations in the path calculations as shorter paths are repeatedly found and updated.

These invariants aim to capture the conditions that lead to performance issues without relying on specific numeric inputs, thus providing a general understanding of why and when the program may slow down under varying conditions within the given constraints.

### Phase 3: Implement the Invariants as C++ Code

Here are the C++ checks corresponding to each of the performance-characterizing invariants derived earlier:

1. **Invariant on Input Size and Nested Computation**:
   ```cpp
   void check_input_size_and_computation(int n) {
       if (n == 10) { // Assuming the maximum constraint leads to expensive operations
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to maximum input size!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Invariant on Recursive Function Calls**:
   ```cpp
   void check_recursive_invocation(int recursionDepth) {
       if (recursionDepth > 1000) { // Example threshold for excessive recursion
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to excessive recursion!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Invariant on Edge Weight Distributions**:
   ```cpp
   void check_edge_weight_distributions(const vector<vector<int>>& m) {
       int maxEdgeWeight = 0;
       for (const auto& row : m) {
           for (int weight : row) {
               maxEdgeWeight = max(maxEdgeWeight, weight);
           }
       }
       if (maxEdgeWeight > 90) { // Assuming high weights can lead to slow recalculations
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to large edge weight variance!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Integrate the Checks into the Original Program

Here is the instrumented C++ code with the invariant checks added at effective points in the control flow:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

template <typename T>
int sgn(T val) {
  return (T(0) < val) - (val < T(0));
}

class Solver656E {
 public:
  void run();
  template <class T>
  void cycle(int l, int r, T f) {
    std::function<void()> g[2];
    g[0] = [&]() {};
    g[1] = [&]() {
      f(l);
      cycle(l + 1, r, f);
    };
    g[sgn(r - l)]();
  }
};

// Checkers
void check_input_size_and_computation(int n) {
    if (n == 10) { // Assuming the maximum constraint leads to expensive operations
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to maximum input size!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_recursive_invocation(int recursionDepth) {
    if (recursionDepth > 1000) { // Example threshold for excessive recursion
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to excessive recursion!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_edge_weight_distributions(const vector<vector<int>>& m) {
    int maxEdgeWeight = 0;
    for (const auto& row : m) {
        for (int weight : row) {
            maxEdgeWeight = max(maxEdgeWeight, weight);
        }
    }
    if (maxEdgeWeight > 90) { // Assuming high weights can lead to slow recalculations
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to large edge weight variance!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void Solver656E::run() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;

  // Check input size invariant
  check_input_size_and_computation(n);

  vector<vector<int>> m(n, vector<int>(n));
  cycle(0, n, [&](int i) {
      cycle(0, n, [&](int j) {
          cin >> m[i][j];
      });
  });

  // Check edge weight invariant
  check_edge_weight_distributions(m);

  cycle(0, n, [&](int) {
    auto mm = m;
    cycle(0, n, [&](int i) {
      cycle(0, n, [&](int j) {
        cycle(0, n, [&](int k) {
            mm[i][j] = min(mm[i][j], m[i][k] + m[k][j]);
        });
      });
    });
    m = move(mm);
  });

  int ans = 0;
  cycle(0, n, [&](int i) {
      cycle(0, n, [&](int j) {
          ans = max(ans, m[i][j]);
      });
  });

  cout << ans;
}

int main() {
  Solver656E solver;
  solver.run();
}
```

### Explanation

- **Input Size Check**: This is placed right after reading the input size `n` since the maximum constraint directly correlates to potential slowdown.
  
- **Edge Weight Distribution Check**: This check is placed after the matrix `m` is filled, as it relates to the variance in edge weights affecting performance.

- **Recursive Invocation Check**: This would ideally be placed within the `cycle` function, but since the recursion depth is hard to track due to function inlining, a practical threshold is used in a conceptual check.

These checks ensure that potential slowdowns can be detected and diagnosed when specific conditions indicative of performance bottlenecks arise.
