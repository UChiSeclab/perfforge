system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

Dima, Inna and Seryozha have gathered in a room. That's right, someone's got to go. To cheer Seryozha up and inspire him to have a walk, Inna decided to cook something. 

Dima and Seryozha have n fruits in the fridge. Each fruit has two parameters: the taste and the number of calories. Inna decided to make a fruit salad, so she wants to take some fruits from the fridge for it. Inna follows a certain principle as she chooses the fruits: the total taste to the total calories ratio of the chosen fruits must equal k. In other words, <image> , where aj is the taste of the j-th chosen fruit and bj is its calories.

Inna hasn't chosen the fruits yet, she is thinking: what is the maximum taste of the chosen fruits if she strictly follows her principle? Help Inna solve this culinary problem — now the happiness of a young couple is in your hands!

Inna loves Dima very much so she wants to make the salad from at least one fruit.

Input

The first line of the input contains two integers n, k (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10). The second line of the input contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 100) — the fruits' tastes. The third line of the input contains n integers b1, b2, ..., bn (1 ≤ bi ≤ 100) — the fruits' calories. Fruit number i has taste ai and calories bi.

Output

If there is no way Inna can choose the fruits for the salad, print in the single line number -1. Otherwise, print a single integer — the maximum possible sum of the taste values of the chosen fruits.

Examples

Input

3 2
10 8 1
2 7 1


Output

18


Input

5 3
4 4 4 4 4
2 2 2 2 2


Output

-1

Note

In the first test sample we can get the total taste of the fruits equal to 18 if we choose fruit number 1 and fruit number 2, then the total calories will equal 9. The condition <image> fulfills, that's exactly what Inna wants.

In the second test sample we cannot choose the fruits so as to follow Inna's principle.

(F) Program Solving the Problem Statement

#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
map<int, int> m1, m2;
int a[105], b[105];
int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(0);
  int n, k;
  cin >> n >> k;
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) cin >> a[i];
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
    cin >> b[i];
    b[i] = a[i] - b[i] * k;
  }
  m2[0] = 0;
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
    m1.clear();
    m1 = m2;
    for (auto j : m1)
      m2[j.first + b[i]] = max(m2[j.first + b[i]], m1[j.first] + a[i]);
  }
  if (m2[0]) {
    cout << m2[0];
  } else {
    cout << -1;
  }
}

assistant: Let's analyze the provided C code to derive performance-characterizing invariants based on the differences in hit counts between the slow and fast inputs.

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Comparison of Hit Counts:**
   - The major difference in hit counts is observed in the nested loop structure:
     - Line 18 (`for (auto j : m1)`) is hit 314,015 times for the slow input compared to 51,598 times for the fast input.
     - Line 19 (`m2[j.first + b[i]] = max(...)`) follows the same pattern, indicating that this section of code is executed significantly more often for the slow input.

2. **Potential Causes for the Slow Input:**
   - The `for (auto j : m1)` loop iterates over `m1`, and the number of iterations depends on how many elements are in `m1`.
   - The transformation `b[i] = a[i] - b[i] * k` affects how `j.first + b[i]` is calculated and influences the number of keys in `m2`.
   - Many keys in `m2` implies that many potential combinations of chosen fruits fit the `total_taste / total_calories` ratio, exhibiting a large state space to explore.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the analysis, let's derive natural language invariants that characterize when the code enters a slow path:

1. **Invariant on State Space Explosion:**
   - "If the transformation `b[i] = a[i] - b[i] * k` results in a large number of unique values, the state space of potential solutions grows excessively, leading to slow performance."
   - **Explanation:** The line-level hit counts suggest that a wide range of `j.first + b[i]` values expands the map `m2`, causing the inner loop to execute many more times.

2. **Invariant on Combinatorial Explosion:**
   - "When the combinations of taste and adjusted calorie values (i.e., `a[i]` and `b[i] - a[i] * k`) create many valid states, the algorithm's complexity increases significantly."
   - **Explanation:** This invariant captures how input combinations can lead to a high branching factor within the dynamic programming approach, slowing the code.

3. **Invariant on Input Structure:**
   - "If the inputs are structured such that many fruits have similar `b[i]` values after adjustment, the program can explore many redundant or near-similar states, leading to increased computation time."
   - **Explanation:** The hit counts indicate that certain inputs, perhaps when `b[i]` values cluster around specific transformed values, significantly increase execution time.

By identifying these conditions, we can better understand why the slow input leads to a performance bottleneck and anticipate similar slowdowns with other inputs. These invariants help inform potential optimizations or guide fuzz testing to reveal additional edge cases.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
Dima, Inna and Seryozha have gathered in a room. That's right, someone's got to go. To cheer Seryozha up and inspire him to have a walk, Inna decided to cook something. 

Dima and Seryozha have n fruits in the fridge. Each fruit has two parameters: the taste and the number of calories. Inna decided to make a fruit salad, so she wants to take some fruits from the fridge for it. Inna follows a certain principle as she chooses the fruits: the total taste to the total calories ratio of the chosen fruits must equal k. In other words, <image> , where aj is the taste of the j-th chosen fruit and bj is its calories.

Inna hasn't chosen the fruits yet, she is thinking: what is the maximum taste of the chosen fruits if she strictly follows her principle? Help Inna solve this culinary problem — now the happiness of a young couple is in your hands!

Inna loves Dima very much so she wants to make the salad from at least one fruit.

Input

The first line of the input contains two integers n, k (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10). The second line of the input contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 100) — the fruits' tastes. The third line of the input contains n integers b1, b2, ..., bn (1 ≤ bi ≤ 100) — the fruits' calories. Fruit number i has taste ai and calories bi.

Output

If there is no way Inna can choose the fruits for the salad, print in the single line number -1. Otherwise, print a single integer — the maximum possible sum of the taste values of the chosen fruits.

Examples

Input

3 2
10 8 1
2 7 1


Output

18


Input

5 3
4 4 4 4 4
2 2 2 2 2


Output

-1

Note

In the first test sample we can get the total taste of the fruits equal to 18 if we choose fruit number 1 and fruit number 2, then the total calories will equal 9. The condition <image> fulfills, that's exactly what Inna wants.

In the second test sample we cannot choose the fruits so as to follow Inna's principle.

Solution (C++ code):
{solution}


assistant: ### Phase 3: Implementing Performance-Characterizing Invariants as C++ Code

Let's translate each invariant into C++ checker code. These checkers will help identify scenarios when the program's performance might degrade, based on the previously derived natural language descriptions.

#### Invariant 1: State Space Explosion
```cpp
void check_state_space_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: State space invariant triggered - large number of unique states!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

#### Invariant 2: Combinatorial Explosion
```cpp
void check_combinatorial_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Combinatorial invariant triggered - excessive valid state combinations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

#### Invariant 3: Input Structure Impact
```cpp
void check_input_structure_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Input structure invariant triggered - redundant or similar states!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrating Checkers into the Original C++ Program

Now, let's integrate these checkers into the provided C++ code. We'll strategically place them to ensure they run efficiently without adding overhead to tight loops.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

map<int, int> m1, m2;
int a[105], b[105];

// Checker for state space explosion
void check_state_space_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: State space invariant triggered - large number of unique states!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Checker for combinatorial explosion
void check_combinatorial_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Combinatorial invariant triggered - excessive valid state combinations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }

### Explanation of Check Placement

- **State Space Invariant:** Placed after calculating `b[i]` to detect large ranges in the transformed values.
- **Combinatorial Invariant:** Placed before entering the inner loop to check the size of `m1`, which could indicate a large number of potential states.
- **Input Structure Invariant:** Placed after constructing `m2` to detect excessive entries, indicating many similar or redundant states.

These checks are designed to help identify performance bottlenecks without impacting the program's main execution flow, especially in tight loops.
