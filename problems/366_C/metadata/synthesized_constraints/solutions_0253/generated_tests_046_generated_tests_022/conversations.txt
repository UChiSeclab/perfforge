system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

Dima, Inna and Seryozha have gathered in a room. That's right, someone's got to go. To cheer Seryozha up and inspire him to have a walk, Inna decided to cook something. 

Dima and Seryozha have n fruits in the fridge. Each fruit has two parameters: the taste and the number of calories. Inna decided to make a fruit salad, so she wants to take some fruits from the fridge for it. Inna follows a certain principle as she chooses the fruits: the total taste to the total calories ratio of the chosen fruits must equal k. In other words, <image> , where aj is the taste of the j-th chosen fruit and bj is its calories.

Inna hasn't chosen the fruits yet, she is thinking: what is the maximum taste of the chosen fruits if she strictly follows her principle? Help Inna solve this culinary problem — now the happiness of a young couple is in your hands!

Inna loves Dima very much so she wants to make the salad from at least one fruit.

Input

The first line of the input contains two integers n, k (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10). The second line of the input contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 100) — the fruits' tastes. The third line of the input contains n integers b1, b2, ..., bn (1 ≤ bi ≤ 100) — the fruits' calories. Fruit number i has taste ai and calories bi.

Output

If there is no way Inna can choose the fruits for the salad, print in the single line number -1. Otherwise, print a single integer — the maximum possible sum of the taste values of the chosen fruits.

Examples

Input

3 2
10 8 1
2 7 1


Output

18


Input

5 3
4 4 4 4 4
2 2 2 2 2


Output

-1

Note

In the first test sample we can get the total taste of the fruits equal to 18 if we choose fruit number 1 and fruit number 2, then the total calories will equal 9. The condition <image> fulfills, that's exactly what Inna wants.

In the second test sample we cannot choose the fruits so as to follow Inna's principle.

assistant: To determine why the program runs slower with the slow input compared to the fast input, we need to analyze which sections of the code are hit more frequently and might be causing performance bottlenecks.

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **High Frequency Lines:**
   - **Lines 37-38 and Lines 42-43**: These lines contain nested loops that exhibit a significant increase in hit counts for the slow input. Specifically, the loop on line 42 (`for (int j = max2; j >= d[i]; j--)`) is hit 442,020 times compared to 23,954 times for the fast input. This suggests the presence of a performance bottleneck.
   - The logic inside these loops is performing dynamic programming updates which involve iterating over potentially large ranges (`max1` and `max2`).

2. **Critical Observations:**
   - The substantial difference in hit counts between slow and fast inputs indicates that the values of `max1` and `max2` are different for the two inputs, causing the loops to iterate more times for the slow input.
   - The bottleneck appears to be the number of iterations in these loops, driven by the dynamic programming approach used to find the maximum taste.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the analysis, we can derive a set of conditions under which the program is likely to slow down:

1. **Dynamic Programming Range:**
   - When `max1` or `max2` is significantly large compared to the number of fruits `n`, the nested loops for updating the `dp1` and `dp2` arrays will iterate many times, potentially causing a slowdown.
   - **Invariant Statement:** "If the sum of the potential taste-calorie differences (`max1` or `max2`) is large relative to the number of fruits, the computation may become slow due to extensive dynamic programming updates."

2. **Distribution of Taste and Calories:**
   - If many fruits have a taste-to-calorie ratio close to `k`, the values `c[i]` and `d[i]` (representing the deviations from `k`) can become small, leading to a larger effective search space for the dynamic programming algorithm.
   - **Invariant Statement:** "When a significant proportion of fruits have their taste-to-calorie ratio close to `k`, the dynamic programming search space increases, potentially leading to a slowdown."

3. **Number of Fruits in Each Category:**
   - A high number of fruits categorized into either `m1` or `m2` can indicate more combinations to consider, hence increasing computational complexity.
   - **Invariant Statement:** "If a large number of fruits fall into the category where their taste-to-calorie deviation is non-zero, the program may slow down due to increased combination calculations."

These invariants help in understanding scenarios that might trigger slow execution paths in the program without relying on specific numeric values from the inputs, but rather on structural and relational insights from the problem constraints.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function

Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
Dima, Inna and Seryozha have gathered in a room. That's right, someone's got to go. To cheer Seryozha up and inspire him to have a walk, Inna decided to cook something. 

Dima and Seryozha have n fruits in the fridge. Each fruit has two parameters: the taste and the number of calories. Inna decided to make a fruit salad, so she wants to take some fruits from the fridge for it. Inna follows a certain principle as she chooses the fruits: the total taste to the total calories ratio of the chosen fruits must equal k. In other words, <image> , where aj is the taste of the j-th chosen fruit and bj is its calories.

Inna hasn't chosen the fruits yet, she is thinking: what is the maximum taste of the chosen fruits if she strictly follows her principle? Help Inna solve this culinary problem — now the happiness of a young couple is in your hands!

Inna loves Dima very much so she wants to make the salad from at least one fruit.

Input

The first line of the input contains two integers n, k (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10). The second line of the input contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 100) — the fruits' tastes. The third line of the input contains n integers b1, b2, ..., bn (1 ≤ bi ≤ 100) — the fruits' calories. Fruit number i has taste ai and calories bi.

Output

If there is no way Inna can choose the fruits for the salad, print in the single line number -1. Otherwise, print a single integer — the maximum possible sum of the taste values of the chosen fruits.

Examples

Input

3 2
10 8 1
2 7 1


Output

18


Input

5 3
4 4 4 4 4
2 2 2 2 2


Output

-1

Note

In the first test sample we can get the total taste of the fruits equal to 18 if we choose fruit number 1 and fruit number 2, then the total calories will equal 9. The condition <image> fulfills, that's exactly what Inna wants.

In the second test sample we cannot choose the fruits so as to follow Inna's principle.

Solution (C++ code):

assistant: ## Phase 3: Implementing the Natural Language Invariants in C++

Let's create C++ code snippets to check the conditions corresponding to the performance-characterizing invariants derived earlier. We will implement these as helper functions that can be called at appropriate points in the program.

### Invariant 1: Dynamic Programming Range
```cpp
void check_dp_range_invariant(int max1, int max2, int n) {
    int threshold = 10000; // Define a reasonable threshold considering problem constraints
    if (max1 > threshold || max2 > threshold) {
        cerr << "Warning: dp_range_invariant triggered - large sum of taste-calorie differences" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Invariant 2: Distribution of Taste and Calories
```cpp
void check_ratio_distribution_invariant(int countCloseToK, int n) {
    int threshold = n / 2; // Half of the fruits having a ratio close to k can imply a problem
    if (countCloseToK > threshold) {
        cerr << "Warning: ratio_distribution_invariant triggered - many fruits close to the k ratio" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Invariant 3: Number of Fruits in Each Category
```cpp
void check_category_distribution_invariant(int l1, int l2, int n) {
    int threshold = n / 2; // If more than half of fruits are categorized, it might cause issues
    if (l1 > threshold || l2 > threshold) {
        cerr << "Warning: category_distribution_invariant triggered - many fruits in one category" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

## Phase 4: Integrating the Checks into the Original Program

Now, we will integrate the checker functions into the C++ solution provided earlier. We'll place these checks after reading inputs where `max1`, `max2`, and category counts are established but before they potentially cause performance problems.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int n, k;
map<int, int> m1;
map<int, int> m2;
int a[101], b[101], c[101], d[101];
int dp1[100001], dp2[100001];

// Invariant Checkers
void check_dp_range_invariant(int max1, int max2, int n) {
    int threshold = 10000; // Define a reasonable threshold considering problem constraints
    if (max1 > threshold || max2 > threshold) {
        cerr << "Warning: dp_range_invariant triggered - large sum of taste-calorie differences" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_ratio_distribution_invariant(int countCloseToK, int n) {
    int threshold = n / 2; // Half of the fruits having a ratio close to k can imply a problem
    if (countCloseToK > threshold) {
        cerr << "Warning: ratio_distribution_invariant triggered - many fruits close to the k ratio" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_category_distribution_invariant(int l1, int l2, int n) {
    int threshold = n / 2; // If more than half of fruits are categorized, it might cause issues
    if (l1 > threshold || l2 > threshold) {
        cerr << "Warning: category_distribution_invariant triggered - many fruits in one category" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    memset(dp1, -0x3f3f3f3f, sizeof(dp1));
    memset(dp2, -0x3f3f3f3f, sizeof(dp2));
    cin >> n >> k;
    
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        cin >> a[i];
    }
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        cin >> b[i];
    }
    
    int l1 = 1, l2 = 1;
    int max1 = 0, max2 = 0;
    int countCloseToK = 0; // Count how many fruits have a taste-calorie ratio close to k

    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        int x = a[i] - k * b[i];
        if (x >= 0) {
            m1[l1] = i;
            max1 += x;
            c[l1] = x;
            l1++;
        } else if (x < 0) {
            m2[l2] = i;
            max2 += -x;
            d[l2] = -x;
            l2++;
        }
        
        if (abs(a[i] - k * b[i]) < k) { // Consider "close" if within k range
            countCloseToK++;
        }
    }

    // Insert invariant checks
    check_dp_range_invariant(max1, max2, n);
    check_ratio_distribution_invariant(countCloseToK, n);
    check_category_distribution_invariant(l1, l2, n);
    
    dp1[0] = 0;
    dp2[0] = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i < l1; i++) {
        for (int j = max1; j >= c[i]; j--) {
            dp1[j] = max(dp1[j], dp1[j - c[i]] + a[m1[i]]);
        }
    }
    for (int i = 1; i < l2; i++) {
        for (int j = max2; j >= d[i]; j--) {
            dp2[j] = max(dp2[j], dp2[j - d[i]] + a[m2[i]]);
        }
    }
    int ans = -1;
    for (int i = 1; i <= max(max1, max2); i++) {
        ans = max(ans, dp1[i] + dp2[i]);
    }
    if (dp1[0] != 0) ans = max(ans, dp1[0]);
    cout << ans << endl;
}
```

### Explanation:
- **`check_dp_range_invariant`**: Checks if `max1` or `max2` are too large, indicating potential performance issues in dynamic programming loops.
- **`check_ratio_distribution_invariant`**: Checks if too many fruits have a taste-to-calorie ratio close to `k`, causing a large search space.
- **`check_category_distribution_invariant`**: Checks if too many fruits are categorized into either `m1` or `m2`, potentially increasing complexity.
