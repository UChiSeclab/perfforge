### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Comparison of Line-Level Hit Counts:**
   - The `Judge` function (lines 33-37) and the loops within `Check` (lines 54-66) show significantly higher hit counts in the slow input compared to the fast input. Specifically:
     - `Judge` function is hit 1,387,590 times for the slow input vs. 786,480 times for the fast input.
     - The loop in `Check` that iterates to potentially 5000 (line 54) is hit significantly more for the slow input (271,686) compared to the fast input (154,056).

2. **Identification of Problematic Areas:**
   - The nested loops in `Check` and `Solve` functions contribute to the high number of hits.
   - The condition checking within the `Judge` function and the `for` loops in `Check` seem prone to becoming performance bottlenecks due to their extensive iteration.

3. **Interaction with Data Structures:**
   - The `Check` function extensively uses arrays `v` and `p`, and the slow input causes these arrays to have conditions met that iterate over their elements many more times.
   - The use of these arrays and the conditions tied to the fractions in the `Judge` function likely cause more iterations, leading to the slowdown.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants (Natural Language)

1. **Invariant #1: Fractional Check Loops**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "When solving a problem set involves altering the participant ratios significantly, the iterative check to adjust these ratios can lead to extensive loops, increasing execution time."
   - This invariant is linked to the computation of the fraction of problem solvers (via the `Judge` function) and how it influences the loop conditions.

2. **Invariant #2: Recursive Depth and Extensive Enumeration**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "The recursive enumeration of possible scoring thresholds becomes expensive when the problem score conditions allow numerous permutations, leading to increased depth in solution exploration."
   - This invariant highlights the potential depth of recursion and enumeration in `Solve` as it sets scoring conditions (`p` values).

3. **Invariant #3: Heavy Iterative Adjustments**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "When attempting to adjust submission counts to influence scoring dynamically, the necessary iterations can become excessive, resulting in a slowdown if numerous adjustments are needed."
   - This relates to the loop in `Check` that iterates up to 5000 times, particularly when scores for each problem need to be adjusted many times to find an optimal solution.

By understanding these invariants, you can identify scenarios where the performance of the program degrades due to extensive iterative checks and recursive depth when processing inputs structured in a way that significantly affects score computations.

### Phase 3: Implementing the Natural Language Invariants as C++ Checkers

Here are the C++ code snippets implementing the performance-characterizing invariants identified in Phase 2:

1. **Invariant #1: Fractional Check Loops**

```cpp
void check_fractional_loops(int iterationCount) {
    if (iterationCount > 1000000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered in fractional check loops!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

2. **Invariant #2: Recursive Depth and Extensive Enumeration**

```cpp
void check_recursive_depth(int recursionDepth) {
    if (recursionDepth > 1000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to extensive recursive depth!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

3. **Invariant #3: Heavy Iterative Adjustments**

```cpp
void check_iterative_adjustments(int iterationCount) {
    if (iterationCount > 5000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to heavy iterative adjustments!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrating Checkers into the C++ Program

Below is the original C++ code instrumented with these checks. Each check is placed strategically to avoid adding overhead within tight loops but still effectively catch the potential bottlenecks.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int n, ans;
int a[200][10];
int p[10];

struct Node {
    double l, r;
    int w;
} c[10];

struct Point {
    int S, T;
} u[10], v[10];

void Op() {
    c[1].l = -(1e-7);
    c[1].r = 1.00 / 32.00;
    c[1].w = 3000;
    c[2].l = 1.00 / 32.00;
    c[2].r = 1.00 / 16.00;
    c[2].w = 2500;
    c[3].l = 1.00 / 16.00;
    c[3].r = 1.00 / 8.00;
    c[3].w = 2000;
    c[4].l = 1.00 / 8.00;
    c[4].r = 1.00 / 4.00;
    c[4].w = 1500;
    c[5].l = 1.00 / 4.00;
    c[5].r = 1.00 / 2.00;
    c[5].w = 1000;
    c[6].l = 1.00 / 2.00;
    c[6].r = 1.00 / 1.00;
    c[6].w = 500;
}

bool Judge(Point R, int t) {
    double p = (double)R.T / (double)R.S;
    if (p <= c[t].l) return 0;
    if (p > c[t].r) return 0;
    return 1;
}

void Check() {
    int ans1 = 0, ans2 = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
        if (a[1][i] != -1) ans1 += c[p[i]].w / 250 * (250 - a[1][i]);
        if (a[2][i] != -1) ans2 += c[p[i]].w / 250 * (250 - a[2][i]);
        v[i] = u[i];
    }
    if (ans1 <= ans2) return;
    bool ok = 1;
    for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++)
        if (!Judge(v[i], p[i])) ok = 0;
    if (ok) {
        ans = 0;
        return;
    }

    int iterationCount = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= 5000; i++) {
        for (int j = 1; j <= 5; j++) {
            v[j].S++;
            if ((double)v[j].T / (double)v[j].S <= c[p[j]].l && a[1][j] != -1)
                v[j].T++;
        }

        check_iterative_adjustments(++iterationCount);  // Check for heavy iterative adjustments

        bool ok = 1;
        for (int j = 1; j <= 5; j++)
            if (!Judge(v[j], p[j])) ok = 0;
        if (ok) {
            ans = min(ans, i);
            return;
        }
    }
}

void Solve(int x, int recursionDepth = 0) {
    check_recursive_depth(recursionDepth);  // Check for excessive recursive depth

    if (x > 5) {
        Check();
        return;
    }
    for (int i = 1; i <= 6; i++) {
        p[x] = i;
        Solve(x + 1, recursionDepth + 1);
    }
}

int main() {
    Op();
    scanf("%d", &n);
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++)
        for (int j = 1; j <= 5; j++) scanf("%d", &a[i][j]);
    for (int j = 1; j <= 5; j++) {
        u[j].S = u[j].T = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            if (a[i][j] != -1) u[j].T++;
            u[j].S++;
        }
    }
    ans = 1 << 30;
    Solve(1);
    if (ans == 1 << 30)
        printf("-1\n");
    else
        printf("%d\n", ans);
}
```

In this code, checks for performance bottlenecks are added:
- **`check_iterative_adjustments`** is called inside the loop in `Check` to detect excessive iterations.
- **`check_recursive_depth`** is called within `Solve` to monitor recursion depth.

These checks should help detect and abort execution during scenarios that could lead to performance degradation.
