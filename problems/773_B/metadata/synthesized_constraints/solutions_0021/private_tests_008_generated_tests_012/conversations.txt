system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

Vasya and Petya take part in a Codeforces round. The round lasts for two hours and contains five problems.

For this round the dynamic problem scoring is used. If you were lucky not to participate in any Codeforces round with dynamic problem scoring, here is what it means. The maximum point value of the problem depends on the ratio of the number of participants who solved the problem to the total number of round participants. Everyone who made at least one submission is considered to be participating in the round.

<image>

Pay attention to the range bounds. For example, if 40 people are taking part in the round, and 10 of them solve a particular problem, then the solvers fraction is equal to 1 / 4, and the problem's maximum point value is equal to 1500.

If the problem's maximum point value is equal to x, then for each whole minute passed from the beginning of the contest to the moment of the participant's correct submission, the participant loses x / 250 points. For example, if the problem's maximum point value is 2000, and the participant submits a correct solution to it 40 minutes into the round, this participant will be awarded with 2000·(1 - 40 / 250) = 1680 points for this problem.

There are n participants in the round, including Vasya and Petya. For each participant and each problem, the number of minutes which passed between the beginning of the contest and the submission of this participant to this problem is known. It's also possible that this participant made no submissions to this problem.

With two seconds until the end of the round, all participants' submissions have passed pretests, and not a single hack attempt has been made. Vasya believes that no more submissions or hack attempts will be made in the remaining two seconds, and every submission will pass the system testing.

Unfortunately, Vasya is a cheater. He has registered 109 + 7 new accounts for the round. Now Vasya can submit any of his solutions from these new accounts in order to change the maximum point values of the problems. Vasya can also submit any wrong solutions to any problems. Note that Vasya can not submit correct solutions to the problems he hasn't solved.

Vasya seeks to score strictly more points than Petya in the current round. Vasya has already prepared the scripts which allow to obfuscate his solutions and submit them into the system from any of the new accounts in just fractions of seconds. However, Vasya doesn't want to make his cheating too obvious, so he wants to achieve his goal while making submissions from the smallest possible number of new accounts.

Find the smallest number of new accounts Vasya needs in order to beat Petya (provided that Vasya's assumptions are correct), or report that Vasya can't achieve his goal.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 120) — the number of round participants, including Vasya and Petya.

Each of the next n lines contains five integers ai, 1, ai, 2..., ai, 5 ( - 1 ≤ ai, j ≤ 119) — the number of minutes passed between the beginning of the round and the submission of problem j by participant i, or -1 if participant i hasn't solved problem j.

It is guaranteed that each participant has made at least one successful submission.

Vasya is listed as participant number 1, Petya is listed as participant number 2, all the other participants are listed in no particular order.

Output

Output a single integer — the number of new accounts Vasya needs to beat Petya, or -1 if Vasya can't achieve his goal.

Note

In the first example, Vasya's optimal strategy is to submit the solutions to the last three problems from two new accounts. In this case the first two problems will have the maximum point value of 1000, while the last three problems will have the maximum point value of 500. Vasya's score will be equal to 980 + 940 + 420 + 360 + 270 = 2970 points, while Petya will score just 800 + 820 + 420 + 440 + 470 = 2950 points.

In the second example, Vasya has to make a single unsuccessful submission to any problem from two new accounts, and a single successful submission to the first problem from the third new account. In this case, the maximum point values of the problems will be equal to 500, 1500, 1000, 1500, 3000. Vasya will score 2370 points, while Petya will score just 2294 points.

In the third example, Vasya can achieve his goal by submitting the solutions to the first four problems from 27 new accounts. The maximum point values of the problems will be equal to 500, 500, 500, 500, 2000. Thanks to the high cost of the fifth problem, Vasya will manage to beat Petya who solved the first four problems very quickly, but couldn't solve the fifth one.

assistant: To analyze the provided C code and generate performance-characterizing invariants, we'll follow a structured approach as outlined in the task:

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Comparison of Line-Level Hit Counts:**
   - The function `maxscore` (lines 6-12) is called very frequently during the slow input run, with 12,000,120 hits, compared to just 160 hits for the fast input.
   - Likewise, the function `win` (lines 14-21) is called 2,400,024 times in the slow input, compared to only 32 times in the fast input.
   - The loop starting at line 37 seems to iterate over 32 different combinations, but the nested loop from lines 45-46 that checks `win(x)` performs poorly for the slow input, leading to the excessive hit counts.

2. **Pinpointing Inefficient Interactions:**
   - The inefficiency arises primarily in how frequently the `win` function is invoked within the loop structure. The loop at line 45 iterates up to 100,000 times, significantly contributing to the high hit count for `win` and `maxscore` during the slow input.
   - The conditions under which `maxscore` logic switches are related to the dynamic point value calculation, heavily affected by the contributions of `s[i]` and `c[i]`.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **Conditions Describing When the Program Enters a Slow Path:**

   **Invariant 1: Frequent Re-evaluation of Scores**
   - **Natural Language Description:**
     "If the logic for determining maximum scores is repeatedly evaluated due to a large number of account submissions (potentially up to the maximum iteration threshold), the computation time will increase significantly."
   - **Code Description:**
     This happens particularly when the number of potential account manipulations (`mid` values) results in a high number of iterations in the loop structure (lines 45-46).

2. **Threshold Values Aligned with Problem Constraints:**

   **Invariant 2: Inefficient Exploratory Loops**
   - **Natural Language Description:**
     "When the loop responsible for determining the optimal number of new accounts to influence scores (`win` checks) operates near its maximum iteration limit without convergence, performance degrades."
   - **Code Description:**
     The loop from lines 45-47 runs extensively, and if the score modification logic (inside `win`) doesn't quickly satisfy the condition for Vasya to win, it results in excessive operations.

3. **Broad Statements Capturing Potential Slow Scenarios:**

   **Invariant 3: High Combinatorial Complexity**
   - **Natural Language Description:**
     "If the combinatorial logic assessing different account and problem success/failure combinations grows large, the computational overhead can become substantial."
   - **Code Description:**
     This occurs when the bit manipulations (lines 37-41) combined with the iteration over `mid` (lines 45-46) lead to an exponential increase in checks.

### Output

**Performance-Characterizing Invariants:**

1. **Invariant 1:**  
   "If the function calculating maximum problem scores is invoked excessively due to numerous potential account adjustments, the program's execution time will increase significantly."

2. **Invariant 2:**  
   "When the loop determining the minimum number of new accounts for Vasya to surpass Petya operates near its iteration limit without finding a solution, performance degradation is likely."

3. **Invariant 3:**  
   "The combination of various account and problem success states, when examined in a large search space, can lead to substantial computational overhead."

These invariants provide insights into potential slow scenarios based on observed line-level hit counts and logic flow in the code. They abstract specific numeric values and provide general conditions under which the performance issues are likely to arise.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
Vasya and Petya take part in a Codeforces round. The round lasts for two hours and contains five problems.

For this round the dynamic problem scoring is used. If you were lucky not to participate in any Codeforces round with dynamic problem scoring, here is what it means. The maximum point value of the problem depends on the ratio of the number of participants who solved the problem to the total number of round participants. Everyone who made at least one submission is considered to be participating in the round.

<image>

Pay attention to the range bounds. For example, if 40 people are taking part in the round, and 10 of them solve a particular problem, then the solvers fraction is equal to 1 / 4, and the problem's maximum point value is equal to 1500.

If the problem's maximum point value is equal to x, then for each whole minute passed from the beginning of the contest to the moment of the participant's correct submission, the participant loses x / 250 points. For example, if the problem's maximum point value is 2000, and the participant submits a correct solution to it 40 minutes into the round, this participant will be awarded with 2000·(1 - 40 / 250) = 1680 points for this problem.

There are n participants in the round, including Vasya and Petya. For each participant and each problem, the number of minutes which passed between the beginning of the contest and the submission of this participant to this problem is known. It's also possible that this participant made no submissions to this problem.

With two seconds until the end of the round, all participants' submissions have passed pretests, and not a single hack attempt has been made. Vasya believes that no more submissions or hack attempts will be made in the remaining two seconds, and every submission will pass the system testing.

Unfortunately, Vasya is a cheater. He has registered 109 + 7 new accounts for the round. Now Vasya can submit any of his solutions from these new accounts in order to change the maximum point values of the problems. Vasya can also submit any wrong solutions to any problems. Note that Vasya can not submit correct solutions to the problems he hasn't solved.

Vasya seeks to score strictly more points than Petya in the current round. Vasya has already prepared the scripts which allow to obfuscate his solutions and submit them into the system from any of the new accounts in just fractions of seconds. However, Vasya doesn't want to make his cheating too obvious, so he wants to achieve his goal while making submissions from the smallest possible number of new accounts.

Find the smallest number of new accounts Vasya needs in order to beat Petya (provided that Vasya's assumptions are correct), or report that Vasya can't achieve his goal.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 120) — the number of round participants, including Vasya and Petya.

Each of the next n lines contains five integers ai, 1, ai, 2..., ai, 5 ( - 1 ≤ ai, j ≤ 119) — the number of minutes passed between the beginning of the round and the submission of problem j by participant i, or -1 if participant i hasn't solved problem j.

It is guaranteed that each participant has made at least one successful submission.

Vasya is listed as participant number 1, Petya is listed as participant number 2, all the other participants are listed in no particular order.

Output

Output a single integer — the number of new accounts Vasya needs to beat Petya, or -1 if Vasya can't achieve his goal.

Output

-1

Note

In the first example, Vasya's optimal strategy is to submit the solutions to the last three problems from two new accounts. In this case the first two problems will have the maximum point value of 1000, while the last three problems will have the maximum point value of 500. Vasya's score will be equal to 980 + 940 + 420 + 360 + 270 = 2970 points, while Petya will score just 800 + 820 + 420 + 440 + 470 = 2950 points.

In the second example, Vasya has to make a single unsuccessful submission to any problem from two new accounts, and a single successful submission to the first problem from the third new account. In this case, the maximum point values of the problems will be equal to 500, 1500, 1000, 1500, 3000. Vasya will score 2370 points, while Petya will score just 2294 points.

In the third example, Vasya can achieve his goal by submitting the solutions to the first four problems from 27 new accounts. The maximum point values of the problems will be equal to 500, 500, 500, 500, 2000. Thanks to the high cost of the fifth problem, Vasya will manage to beat Petya who solved the first four problems very quickly, but couldn't solve the fifth one.

Solution (C++ code):
{solution}


assistant: ### Phase 3: Implementing Performance-Characterizing Invariants in C++

Based on the natural language invariants derived earlier, we need to implement runtime checks in C++ to detect potential performance bottlenecks.

#### Invariant 1: Frequent Re-evaluation of Scores
This invariant detects excessive calls to score calculation due to numerous potential account adjustments.

```cpp
void check_frequent_maxscore_calls(int64_t callCount, int64_t threshold) {
    if (callCount > threshold) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive score calculations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

#### Invariant 2: Inefficient Exploratory Loops
This invariant checks if the loop determining the minimum number of new accounts to influence scores is running excessively.

```cpp
void check_excessive_win_checks(int64_t checkCount, int64_t threshold) {
    if (checkCount > threshold) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive win function checks!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

#### Invariant 3: High Combinatorial Complexity
This invariant examines if the combination logic results in a large search space.

```cpp
void check_combinatorial_explosion(int combinatoryAttempts, int threshold) {
    if (combinatoryAttempts > threshold) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - combinatorial explosion!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrating Checkers into the Original Program

Now, integrate these checkers into the original C++ program to monitor performance bottlenecks effectively. I'll insert checks at points in the program where excessive operations might occur.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
const int64_t MAXN = 1000000007LL;
int n;
vector<int64_t> a(5), b(5), c(5), s(5);

int64_t maxscore(int64_t s, int64_t n) {
    static int64_t scoreCallCount = 0;
    scoreCallCount++;
    check_frequent_maxscore_calls(scoreCallCount, 100000);  // Arbitrary threshold for excessive calls
    if (s * 2 > n) return 500;
    if (s * 4 > n) return 1000;
    if (s * 8 > n) return 1500;
    if (s * 16 > n) return 2000;
    if (s * 32 > n) return 2500;
    return 3000;
}

bool win(int64_t mid) {
    int64_t sa = 0, sb = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        int64_t m = maxscore(s[i] + c[i] * mid, n + mid);
        if (a[i] >= 0) sa += m * (250 - a[i]) / 250;
        if (b[i] >= 0) sb += m * (250 - b[i]) / 250;
    }
    return sa > sb;
}

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(0);
    cin >> n;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < 5; j++) {
            int64_t x;
            cin >> x;
            if (x >= 0) s[j]++;
            if (i == 0) a[j] = x;
            if (i == 1) b[j] = x;
        }
    }
    int64_t minx = -1;
    
    int combinatoryAttempts = 0;  // Track combinatorial attempts
    for (int i = 0; i < 32; i++) {
        bool ok = true;
        for (int j = 0; j < 5; j++) {
            c[j] = (i >> j) & 1;
            if (c[j] && a[j] < 0) ok = false;
        }
        if (!ok) continue;
        
        combinatoryAttempts++;  // Increment for each valid combination attempt
        check_combinatorial_explosion(combinatoryAttempts, 32);  // Check for excessive combinations (logical limit)

        int64_t x;
        int64_t winCheckCount = 0;
        for (x = 0; x < 100000; x++) {
            winCheckCount++;
            if (win(x)) break;
        }
        check_excessive_win_checks(winCheckCount, 100000);  // Arbitrary threshold for win function checks

        if (x == 100000) x = -1;
        for (int j = 0; j < 5; j++) cerr << c[j];
        cerr << ' ' << x << endl;
        minx = x >= 0 && (minx < 0 || x < minx) ? x : minx;
    }
    cout << minx << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Comments

- **Performance Bottleneck Checkers:** These are helper functions placed to monitor conditions prone to causing slowdowns. They can abort execution and report problematic conditions when thresholds are exceeded.
- **Placement of Checks:** The checks are inserted outside of critical loops to avoid further performance degradation and only trigger when necessary, based on thresholds.
- **Thresholds:** The thresholds are set based on the analysis of the problem constraints and the nature of the slow execution path found in the previous phase. Adjust them according to practical observations and testing.
