### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

Based on the given hit count information, we can identify the lines or functions in the C program that get significantly more hits under the slow input compared to the fast input:

1. **DFS Function:**
   - Lines 16-21 have a very high hit count for the slow input (`dfs` function). This function is getting called recursively many times, which suggests that it might be visiting a large number of nodes or paths, especially when `k` is large.

2. **Recursive Function:**
   - Lines 25-42, specifically lines 28, 30, 36-40 (inside `rec` function), also exhibit high hit counts during the slow input run. This indicates that the recursive function is being executed extensively, likely due to the high branching factor combined with a high depth of recursion when `k` approaches `n`.

3. **Loop in `rec` Function:**
   - Line 28 performs a loop that iterates `k` times, and line 36 with the loop iterating over `k`, shows a substantial increase in executions when `k = 8`. This suggests potentially combinatorial growth in recursive calls.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the analysis, we derive the following natural language performance-characterizing invariants:

1. **High Recursion Depth with Large `k`:**
   - "When `k` is large, close to `n`, and specifically when `k` is maximized (e.g., `k = 8` given the constraints), the recursion depth increases significantly. This can lead to a combinatorial explosion in the number of recursive calls due to the increased search space."

2. **Increased Branching Factor:**
   - "When starting conditions allow `k` to be maximized, the branching factor within the recursive calls grows due to multiple valid transitions between states (`k` states leading to `k!` permutations), thereby increasing the computational load."

3. **Excessive DFS Calls:**
   - "When `k` approaches the upper limit (e.g., `k = 8`), each state needs to be validated using DFS to check reachability conditions. The number of DFS calls grows rapidly, causing significant overhead due to repeated traversals."

4. **Combinatorial State Space:**
   - "As `k` increases, the problem leads to a combinatorial state space where the number of valid permutations of house indices that need verification increases factorially, greatly impacting performance."

These invariants help in understanding the conditions under which the algorithm slows down, especially when dealing with large values of `k` close to their maximum threshold within the given constraints.

### Phase 3: Implement the Natural Language Invariants in C++

Here are the checker functions for the performance-characterizing invariants previously derived:

1. **High Recursion Depth with Large `k`:**

```cpp
void check_recursion_invariant(int k) {
    if (k == 8) { // Given the constraint k <= 8
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - High recursion depth with large k" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

2. **Increased Branching Factor:**

```cpp
void check_branching_invariant(int k) {
    if (k == 8) { // The maximum branching factor occurs when k = 8
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - Increased branching factor with large k" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

3. **Excessive DFS Calls:**

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(int k) {
    if (k == 8) { // Maximum DFS calls happen with maximum k
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - Excessive DFS calls with large k" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

4. **Combinatorial State Space:**

```cpp
void check_state_space_invariant(int k) {
    if (k == 8) { // Combinatorial explosion with k = 8
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - Combinatorial state space with large k" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrate the Checkers into the Original Program

Now, we will integrate these checks into the original C++ code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#pragma GCC optimize("O3")
#pragma comment(linker, "/stack:200000000")
#pragma GCC optimize("unroll-loops")
mt19937 rng(chrono::steady_clock::now().time_since_epoch().count());
bool ptime;
void inline fileIO() {
    ptime = false;
    srand((unsigned)time(0));
}
const int mxN = 1e3 + 5;
const int mod = 1e9 + 7;
long long n, k;
int vis[10];

void check_recursion_invariant(int k) {
    if (k == 8) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - High recursion depth with large k" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_branching_invariant(int k) {
    if (k == 8) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - Increased branching factor with large k" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_dfs_invariant(int k) {
    if (k == 8) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - Excessive DFS calls with large k" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_state_space_invariant(int k) {
    if (k == 8) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - Combinatorial state space with large k" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int dfs(int curr, vector<long long>& state) {
    vis[curr] = 1;
    int go = 0;
    if (curr == 1) return 1;
    if (!vis[state[curr]]) {
        go |= dfs(state[curr], state);
    }
    return go;
}

long long rec(long long curr, vector<long long>& state) {
    if (curr == k + 1) {
        long long flag = 1;
        for (int i = 2; i <= k; i++) {
            memset(vis, 0, sizeof vis);
            flag &= dfs(i, state);
        }
        if (k > 1) flag &= 1;
        return flag;
    }
    long long res = 0;
    for (long long nxt = 1; nxt <= k; nxt++) {
        state[curr] = nxt;
        res += rec(curr + 1, state);
        res = (res > mod ? res - mod : res);
        state[curr] = 0;
    }
    return res;
}

void inline solve(int tt) {
    cin >> n >> k;

    // Insert invariant checks here
    check_recursion_invariant(k);
    check_branching_invariant(k);
    check_dfs_invariant(k);
    check_state_space_invariant(k);

    long long ways = 1;
    for (int i = k + 1; n - k && i <= n; i++) {
        ways = (ways * (n - k)) % mod;
    }
    vector<long long> to(k + 1, 0);
    ways = ways * rec(1, to);
    ways %= mod;
    cout << ways << "\n";
}

int main() {
    fileIO();
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
    cin.tie(0);
    cout.tie(0);
    int tt = 0, t = 1;
    while (t--) {
        solve(++tt);
    }
    if (ptime)
        cerr << "processor time: " << clock() / (double)CLOCKS_PER_SEC << "s    ";
    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**

- The checker functions (`check_recursion_invariant`, `check_branching_invariant`, `check_dfs_invariant`, `check_state_space_invariant`) are called immediately after reading `n` and `k` in the `solve` function.
- These checks do not reside inside tight loops but are placed at effective points where they can catch potential performance issues quickly without adding runtime overhead.
- Each checker function triggers a warning and aborts the program if a performance bottleneck condition is detected based on the derived invariants.
