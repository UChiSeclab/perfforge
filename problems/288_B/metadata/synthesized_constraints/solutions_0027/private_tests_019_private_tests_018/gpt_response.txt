### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

Based on the hit count information from the given C program, the main performance bottleneck is found in the following areas:

1. **Recursion in `Back` function**: The number of times the `Back` function is called is significantly higher for the slow input. The recursion depth and the number of recursive calls increase with larger values of `k`, leading to a combinatorial explosion. For the slow input, `Back` is called 19,173,961 times, while for the fast input, it is only called twice.

2. **DFS in `Dfs` function**: The `Dfs` function is heavily called, with over 61 million calls for the slow input. It processes nodes in a depth-first manner, and its hit count indicates that the exploration of nodes in the graph is very time-consuming under the slow input conditions.

3. **Loop Operations in `Ok` function**: The loops in the `Ok` function are executed extensively, indicated by the high hit count for operations like `L[i].clear()` and `L[st[i]].push_back(i)`. This suggests that the function processes a large number of combinations and potential paths, leading to a slowdown.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Here are natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path:

1. **Combinatorial Explosion in Permutations**:
   - "When the value of k is large (close to the maximum) within the input constraints, the recursive exploration of permutations in the `Back` function leads to a combinatorial explosion, significantly increasing the number of recursive calls."

2. **High Recursion Depth in Graph Traversal**:
   - "If k is large, resulting in many connections between nodes, the depth-first traversal in the `Dfs` function can become extremely deep and result in a high number of calls, leading to performance bottlenecks."

3. **Intensive Path Checking**:
   - "When k approaches the upper limit of its range, the `Ok` function performs extensive path checking through nested loops and graph operations, which becomes computationally expensive."

These statements abstractly capture the conditions that trigger slow performance without relying on exact values from the slow input, making them applicable to future scenarios given the constraints.

### Phase 3: Implementing the Invariants as Checker Code in C++

Here are the C++ code snippets that implement runtime checks for the performance-characterizing invariants derived in Phase 2:

1. **Combinatorial Explosion in Permutations**:
   Ensure that `k` does not approach the upper limit excessively to avoid a combinatorial explosion in recursive calls.
   ```cpp
   void check_comb_explosion_invariant(int k) {
       if (k >= 7) {  // Given k must be <= 8, use a threshold close to maximum
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - combinatorial explosion in permutations!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **High Recursion Depth in Graph Traversal**:
   Check for extensive recursion depth in DFS, particularly when `k` is large, leading to high branching.
   ```cpp
   void check_dfs_depth_invariant(int recursionCount) {
       if (recursionCount > 1000000) {  // Arbitrary threshold for recursion
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high recursion depth in DFS!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Intensive Path Checking**:
   Ensure the number of path checks does not become excessive, especially when `k` is large.
   ```cpp
   void check_path_checking_invariant(int k) {
       if (k >= 7) {  // Same threshold due to path checking complexity
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - intensive path checking!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Integrating the Checker Code into the Original Program

Here is the original program with the integrated invariant checks. I've placed the checks at sensible places in the control flow to prevent slowdowns in tight loops:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int n, k, ans, st[10], edge[10];
vector<int> L[10];
bool fr[10];

inline int Pow_Log(int x, int p) {
    int sol = 1;
    while (p) {
        if (p & 1) {
            sol = (1LL * sol * x) % 1000000007;
            --p;
        }
        p >>= 1;
        x = (1LL * x * x) % 1000000007;
    }
    return sol;
}

inline void Dfs(int nod, int& recursionCount) {
    recursionCount++;
    vector<int>::iterator it;
    for (it = L[nod].begin(); it != L[nod].end(); ++it)
        if (!fr[*it]) {
            fr[*it] = true;
            Dfs(*it, recursionCount);
        }
}

inline bool Ok() {
    int i, cnt;
    for (i = 1; i <= k; ++i) L[i].clear();
    for (i = 1; i <= k; ++i) {
        fr[i] = false;
        L[st[i]].push_back(i);
    }
    int recursionCount = 0;
    Dfs(1, recursionCount);
    check_dfs_depth_invariant(recursionCount);  // Check for DFS depth
    for (i = 1, cnt = 0; i <= k; ++i) cnt += fr[i];
    return (cnt == k);
}

inline void Back(int pas) {
    int i;
    if (pas == k + 1) {
        if (Ok()) ++ans;
        return;
    }
    for (i = 1; i <= k; ++i) {
        st[pas] = i;
        Back(pas + 1);
    }
}

void check_comb_explosion_invariant(int k) {
    if (k >= 7) {  // Given k must be <= 8, use a threshold close to maximum
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - combinatorial explosion in permutations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_path_checking_invariant(int k) {
    if (k >= 7) {  // Same threshold due to path checking complexity
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - intensive path checking!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    int i, j;
    cin.sync_with_stdio(0);
    cin >> n >> k;
    
    check_comb_explosion_invariant(k);  // Check for combinatorial explosion
    check_path_checking_invariant(k);   // Check for intensive path checking
    
    Back(1);
    ans = (1LL * ans * Pow_Log(n - k, n - k)) % 1000000007;
    cout << ans;
    return 0;
}
```

**Comments**:
- Each check is placed ahead of the problematic loops or recursive calls to capture the conditions leading to slowdowns effectively.
- The DFS function now takes an additional `recursionCount` parameter to help track depth.
- The checks are inserted at strategic points to prevent interference in the main computational logic.
