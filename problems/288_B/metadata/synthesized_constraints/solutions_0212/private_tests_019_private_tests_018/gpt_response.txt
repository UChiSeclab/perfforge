### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Compare Line-level Hit Counts:**

   - The `dfs` function (lines 6-10) has very high hit counts in the slow input compared to the fast input. The line `return chega[v] = dfs(go[v]);` (line 10) alone shows a hit count of 138,495,616 times for the slow input, whereas the fast input only hits it once.
   
   - The `check` function (lines 12-21) is heavily hit in the slow input, particularly the loop starting at line 14 and the call to `dfs(i)` at line 16.

   - The `solve` function (lines 22-33) also shows significant differences. The loop on line 28 and recursive call to `solve(pos + 1)` on line 30 are hit very frequently in the slow input.

2. **Pinpoint Lines or Functions with Significant Hits:**

   - The `dfs` function and its recursive nature are likely causing the performance bottleneck, especially for the slow input.
   
   - The nested loops and recursive calls in the `solve` function, particularly when `k` is large, contribute to the slowdown.

3. **Infer Interaction with Data Structures:**

   - The `dfs` function explores paths by recursively visiting houses based on the `go` array. A high branching factor or repeated paths can lead to exponential growth in calls.

   - The `solve` function's recursive branching and checking contribute significantly to the slow execution, especially when `k` is high.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-characterizing Invariants

Here are performance-characterizing invariants derived from the code analysis:

1. **High Recursion Depth and Branching Factor:**

   - **Natural Language Statement:** "When `k` is close to its upper limit (e.g., near 8), the recursive calls in the `dfs` function and the `solve` function's depth can lead to a large number of recursive evaluations and increased execution time."

   - **Threshold Contextualization:** Given the constraint `k <= 8`, recursive calls become more complex and numerous, leading to potential slowdown when `k` approaches this limit.

2. **Exponential Growth in Recursive Calls:**

   - **Natural Language Statement:** "The program's performance degrades significantly when the number of recursive paths explored by `dfs` becomes very high, often triggered when `k` increases the search space."

   - **Threshold Contextualization:** The recursive exploration is bounded by `k`, and when `k` is large, it can lead to combinatorial explosion in the number of paths checked.

3. **Loop Intensive Computation:**

   - **Natural Language Statement:** "The extensive looping within the `solve` function, particularly when iterating up to `k`, can result in slow performance when `k` is large, due to the repeated evaluations of recursive conditions."

   - **Threshold Contextualization:** The nested loops and recursive calls are directly affected by the size of `k`, causing increased computation time as `k` nears its constraint.

These performance invariants highlight conditions that lead to the slow execution path of the program. They focus on the impact of high recursion and branching, particularly as the parameter `k` approaches its maximum allowed value.

### Phase 3: Translate the Invariants into Checker Code in C++

Here are the C++ checker functions corresponding to the performance-characterizing invariants:

1. **High Recursion Depth and Branching Factor:**

```cpp
void check_high_recursion_invariant(int k) {
    if (k > 7) { // Given k <= 8, a high value triggers potential deep recursion
        cerr << "Warning: high_recursion_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

2. **Exponential Growth in Recursive Calls:**

```cpp
void check_exponential_growth_invariant(int k) {
    if (k > 6) { // Trigger if k is large, leading to exponential path exploration
        cerr << "Warning: exponential_growth_invariant triggered - exponential growth in recursive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

3. **Loop Intensive Computation:**

```cpp
void check_loop_intensity_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: loop_intensity_invariant triggered - loop intensive computation" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrate the Checker Code in the Original Program

Now, we incorporate these checks into the original C++ program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int n, k;
int go[100];
int chega[100];

void check_high_recursion_invariant(int k) {
    if (k > 7) { // Given k <= 8, a high value triggers potential deep recursion
        cerr << "Warning: high_recursion_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_exponential_growth_invariant(int k) {
    if (k > 6) { // Trigger if k is large, leading to exponential path exploration
        cerr << "Warning: exponential_growth_invariant triggered - exponential growth in recursive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int dfs(int v) {
    if (v == 0) return chega[v] = 1;
    if (chega[v] == 0) return 0;
    chega[v] = 0;
    return chega[v] = dfs(go[v]);
}

bool check() {
    for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) chega[i] = -1;
    for (int i = 0; i < k; i++)
        if (chega[i] == -1) {
            chega[i] = dfs(i);
        }
    for (int i = 0; i < k; i++)
        if (!chega[i]) return 0;
    return 1;
}

long long solve(int pos) {
    if (pos == k) {
        if (check()) return 1;
        return 0;
    }
    long long ret = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
        go[pos] = i;
        ret += solve(pos + 1);
        if (ret >= 1000000007) ret -= 1000000007;
    }
    return ret;
}

int main() {
    cin >> n >> k;
    
    check_high_recursion_invariant(k); // Check for high recursion depth
    check_exponential_growth_invariant(k); // Check for exponential growth potential

    long long ans = 1;
    long long m = (n - k);
    for (int i = 0; i < n - k; i++) {
        ans *= m;
        ans %= 1000000007;
    }
    ans *= solve(0);
    ans %= 1000000007;
    cout << ans << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

- **High Recursion Check:** Before starting the recursive process with `solve`, we check if `k` is high enough to potentially cause deep recursion, which could lead to performance issues.
  
- **Exponential Growth Check:** Similarly, we check if `k`'s value indicates potential exponential growth in recursive paths, which could degrade performance.

These checks are strategically placed to ensure they don't add unnecessary overhead during the critical performance sections of the code. They are used after reading inputs and before heavy loops to help a fuzzer catch performance bottlenecks effectively.
