system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

It is a holiday season, and Koala is decorating his house with cool lights! He owns n lights, all of which flash periodically.

After taking a quick glance at them, Koala realizes that each of his lights can be described with two parameters a_i and b_i. Light with parameters a_i and b_i will toggle (on to off, or off to on) every a_i seconds starting from the b_i-th second. In other words, it will toggle at the moments b_i, b_i + a_i, b_i + 2 ⋅ a_i and so on.

You know for each light whether it's initially on or off and its corresponding parameters a_i and b_i. Koala is wondering what is the maximum number of lights that will ever be on at the same time. So you need to find that out.

<image> Here is a graphic for the first example.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), the number of lights.

The next line contains a string s of n characters. The i-th character is "1", if the i-th lamp is initially on. Otherwise, i-th character is "0".

The i-th of the following n lines contains two integers a_i and b_i (1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 5) — the parameters of the i-th light.

Output

Print a single integer — the maximum number of lights that will ever be on at the same time.

Note

In the second example, all lights are initially on. So the answer is 4.

assistant: **Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments**

Upon comparing the line-level hit counts between the slow and fast inputs, we observe:

1. **Line 26 (`for (long long i = 1; i <= 500; i++)`):** This loop iterates 501 times for the slow input versus only 2 times for the fast input. The loop iterating up to 500 is a clear indicator of where the slowdown occurs.

2. **Lines 28-30 (inner loop and conditionals):** These lines are significantly more frequent in the slow input due to the outer loop's high iteration count:
   - The inner loop (`for (long long j = 0; j < n; j++)`) runs 13,000 times for the slow input compared to 52 times for the fast input.
   - The toggling condition (`if (i >= C[j] && (((i - C[j]) % B[j]) == 0))`) and the toggle effect (`f[j] ^= 1`) appear 12,500 times in the slow input but only 50 times in the fast input.

**Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants**

The slowdown is primarily due to the repeated toggling operations in the nested loops, influenced by the parameters \(C[j]\) and \(B[j]\) of each light.

Here are the performance-characterizing invariants:

1. **High Maximum Time Bound:**
   - *Invariant Description:* "If the maximum time considered for toggling lights (`i` in the loop) is close to or at the upper limit (500), the program may enter a slow path due to excessive iterations over time."
   - *Rationale:* The outer loop iterating up to 500 checks all possible times and is a significant source of slowdown when the condition is not broken early.

2. **Frequent Toggling Within Observed Time:**
   - *Invariant Description:* "The program slows significantly if many lights have parameters leading to frequent toggling over the observed time span. Specifically, when there are multiple lights with small `a_i` values, causing frequent toggles."
   - *Rationale:* Small `a_i` values lead to frequent toggles, and if many lights have similar small `a_i` values, they will toggle often, leading to more operations.

3. **Large Number of Lights:**
   - *Invariant Description:* "Performance may degrade when a large number of lights (`n`) are involved, combined with small `a_i` and `b_i` values, leading to frequent evaluations of toggling conditions."
   - *Rationale:* With a maximum `n` of 100, even modest values can cause many evaluations in the loop, exacerbated by frequent toggle calculations.

These invariants help identify conditions that could cause future slowdowns, guiding optimization or upgrade strategies to prevent similar performance issues.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
It is a holiday season, and Koala is decorating his house with cool lights! He owns n lights, all of which flash periodically.

After taking a quick glance at them, Koala realizes that each of his lights can be described with two parameters a_i and b_i. Light with parameters a_i and b_i will toggle (on to off, or off to on) every a_i seconds starting from the b_i-th second. In other words, it will toggle at the moments b_i, b_i + a_i, b_i + 2 ⋅ a_i and so on.

You know for each light whether it's initially on or off and its corresponding parameters a_i and b_i. Koala is wondering what is the maximum number of lights that will ever be on at the same time. So you need to find that out.

<image> Here is a graphic for the first example.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), the number of lights.

The next line contains a string s of n characters. The i-th character is "1", if the i-th lamp is initially on. Otherwise, i-th character is "0".

The i-th of the following n lines contains two integers a_i and b_i (1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 5) — the parameters of the i-th light.

Output

Print a single integer — the maximum number of lights that will ever be on at the same time.

In the second example, all lights are initially on. So the answer is 4.

Solution (C++ code):
{solution}


assistant: ### Phase 3: Implement the Natural Language Invariants in C++

For each natural language invariant derived, we will create a checker function in C++:

1. **High Maximum Time Bound:**

```cpp
void check_max_time_bound(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high maximum time bound!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

2. **Frequent Toggling Within Observed Time:**

```cpp
void check_frequent_toggling(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - frequent toggling of lights!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

3. **Large Number of Lights:**

```cpp
void check_large_number_of_lights(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large number of lights!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Propagate and Insert Conditional Checks

Now, we will integrate these checks into the original C++ solution:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

void check_max_time_bound(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high maximum time bound!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_frequent_toggling(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - frequent toggling of lights!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_large_number_of_lights(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large number of lights!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

long long n, a, b;
long long f[105];
long long x;
char s[105];
long long B[105];

**Explanation:**

- **Check for Large Number of Lights:** We placed this check after input reading but before significant computation to catch if the number of lights is close to the maximum constraint.
  
- **Check for High Maximum Time Bound:** This check is placed right before the time loop starts to ensure that we do not iterate excessively unless necessary.
  
- **Check for Frequent Toggling:** After setting up the input, we check if any light has a very small `a_i` which would cause frequent toggling, thus slowing down execution. This check runs after we determine the toggle parameters.

These checks aim to efficiently catch scenarios that could lead to performance issues, aligning with the previously derived natural language invariants.
