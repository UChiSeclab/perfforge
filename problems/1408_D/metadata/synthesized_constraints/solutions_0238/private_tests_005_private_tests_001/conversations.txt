system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

There are n robbers at coordinates (a_1, b_1), (a_2, b_2), ..., (a_n, b_n) and m searchlight at coordinates (c_1, d_1), (c_2, d_2), ..., (c_m, d_m). 

In one move you can move each robber to the right (increase a_i of each robber by one) or move each robber up (increase b_i of each robber by one). Note that you should either increase all a_i or all b_i, you can't increase a_i for some points and b_i for some other points.

Searchlight j can see a robber i if a_i ≤ c_j and b_i ≤ d_j. 

A configuration of robbers is safe if no searchlight can see a robber (i.e. if there is no pair i,j such that searchlight j can see a robber i).

What is the minimum number of moves you need to perform to reach a safe configuration?

Input

The first line of input contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000): the number of robbers and the number of searchlight.

Each of the next n lines contains two integers a_i, b_i (0 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^6), coordinates of robbers.

Each of the next m lines contains two integers c_i, d_i (0 ≤ c_i, d_i ≤ 10^6), coordinates of searchlights.

Output

Print one integer: the minimum number of moves you need to perform to reach a safe configuration.

Note

In the first test, you can move each robber to the right three times. After that there will be one robber in the coordinates (3, 0).

The configuration of the robbers is safe, because the only searchlight can't see the robber, because it is in the coordinates (2, 3) and 3 > 2.

In the second test, you can move each robber to the right two times and two times up. After that robbers will be in the coordinates (3, 8), (8, 3).

It's easy the see that the configuration of the robbers is safe.

It can be proved that you can't reach a safe configuration using no more than 3 moves.

assistant: To address the tasks given in the prompt, let's go through the analysis phase by phase.

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

#### Analysis of Hit Counts

1. **For Loop on Line 28:**
   - The loop on line 28 (`for (int i = 0; i <= 1000000 && i < ans; i++)`) is executed 1,000,002 times for the slow input and only 2 times for the fast input.
   - This loop is likely a major contributor to the slowdown, as it iterates over a large range.

2. **While Loop on Line 29:**
   - The nested while loop (`while (pos <= cnt && s[pos].first <= i) pos++;`) is executed 1,000,001 times for the slow input.
   - This loop increments `pos` until a certain condition is met and contributes significantly to slow execution.

3. **Line 30:**
   - This line computes `ans = min(ans, i + x[pos]);` 1,000,001 times for the slow input, indicating frequent evaluations which can be costly.

#### Interaction with Data Structures

- The program uses arrays and sorts a list of pairs, then processes them with loops.
- The combination of nested loops and condition checks on sorted data indicates potential bottlenecks.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the analysis above, here are some performance-characterizing invariants:

1. **Invariant: Large Iteration Range**
   - **Description:** "When the range of iteration in the main loop is large (close to the maximum value of `a_i` or `c_i`), performance may degrade significantly."
   - **Reasoning:** The primary for loop iterating over a large range becomes a performance bottleneck, especially when iterating close to the maximum possible index (which is up to 1,000,000).

2. **Invariant: High Hit Count on Condition Checks**
   - **Description:** "If the condition within a high-frequency loop (such as checking `s[pos].first <= i`) frequently evaluates to true, causing repeated slow path execution, the performance will degrade."
   - **Reasoning:** The while loop advances through the list of conditions, and when the number of such conditions is high, it affects performance.

3. **Invariant: Extensive Searchlight Coverage**
   - **Description:** "If the searchlights can potentially cover a wide range of robber positions (i.e., many `(c_i, d_i)` values are large compared to `(a_i, b_i)`), it requires more iterations to find a safe configuration."
   - **Reasoning:** The searchlight coverage impacts the number of moves needed to escape, increasing the iteration count.

4. **Invariant: High Upper Bound for Moves**
   - **Description:** "Performance may degrade if `ans` starts with a very high initial value, leading to more iterations to converge to the true minimum."
   - **Reasoning:** The initial setting of `ans` as 1,000,005 might lead to excessive iterations before finding the optimal solution.

These invariants capture conditions under which the code may slow down, focusing on iteration bounds, condition checks, and data configuration without relying on specific input values. They are aligned with the problem constraints and designed to help identify potential slow scenarios.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
There are n robbers at coordinates (a_1, b_1), (a_2, b_2), ..., (a_n, b_n) and m searchlight at coordinates (c_1, d_1), (c_2, d_2), ..., (c_m, d_m). 

In one move you can move each robber to the right (increase a_i of each robber by one) or move each robber up (increase b_i of each robber by one). Note that you should either increase all a_i or all b_i, you can't increase a_i for some points and b_i for some other points.

Searchlight j can see a robber i if a_i ≤ c_j and b_i ≤ d_j. 

A configuration of robbers is safe if no searchlight can see a robber (i.e. if there is no pair i,j such that searchlight j can see a robber i).

What is the minimum number of moves you need to perform to reach a safe configuration?

Input

The first line of input contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000): the number of robbers and the number of searchlight.

Each of the next n lines contains two integers a_i, b_i (0 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^6), coordinates of robbers.

Each of the next m lines contains two integers c_i, d_i (0 ≤ c_i, d_i ≤ 10^6), coordinates of searchlights.

Output

Print one integer: the minimum number of moves you need to perform to reach a safe configuration.

Note

In the first test, you can move each robber to the right three times. After that there will be one robber in the coordinates (3, 0).

The configuration of the robbers is safe, because the only searchlight can't see the robber, because it is in the coordinates (2, 3) and 3 > 2.

In the second test, you can move each robber to the right two times and two times up. After that robbers will be in the coordinates (3, 8), (8, 3).

It's easy the see that the configuration of the robbers is safe.

It can be proved that you can't reach a safe configuration using no more than 3 moves.

Solution (C++ code):
{solution}


assistant: ### Phase 3: Implement Checker Code in C++

Now let's translate the performance-characterizing invariants into C++ checker code:

1. **Invariant: Large Iteration Range**
   - **Description:** "When the range of iteration in the main loop is large (close to the maximum value of `a_i` or `c_i`), performance may degrade significantly."
   - **Checker Code:**
   ```cpp
   void check_large_iteration(int range) {
       if (range > 1000000) {
           cerr << "Warning: Large iteration range may cause performance degradation!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Invariant: High Hit Count on Condition Checks**
   - **Description:** "If the condition within a high-frequency loop (such as checking `s[pos].first <= i`) frequently evaluates to true, causing repeated slow path execution, the performance will degrade."
   - **Checker Code:**
   ```cpp
   void check_condition_frequency(int pos, int cnt) {
       if (pos > cnt) {
           cerr << "Warning: High frequency of condition checks detected!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Invariant: Extensive Searchlight Coverage**
   - **Description:** "If the searchlights can potentially cover a wide range of robber positions (i.e., many `(c_i, d_i)` values are large compared to `(a_i, b_i)`), it requires more iterations to find a safe configuration."
   - **Checker Code:**
   ```cpp
   void check_searchlight_coverage(int c_max, int a_max, int d_max, int b_max) {
       if (c_max > a_max && d_max > b_max) {
           cerr << "Warning: Extensive searchlight coverage may increase iteration count!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

4. **Invariant: High Upper Bound for Moves**
   - **Description:** "Performance may degrade if `ans` starts with a very high initial value, leading to more iterations to converge to the true minimum."
   - **Checker Code:**
   ```cpp
   void check_initial_ans_value(int ans) {
       if (ans > 1000000) {
           cerr << "Warning: High initial value of ans may cause excessive iterations!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Integrate Checkers into the Original Program

Now integrate these checkers into the original program at appropriate locations:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#pragma GCC optimize(2)
#pragma GCC optimize(3)
using namespace std;
const int N = 2e5 + 10;
int n, m;
struct uzi {
  int x, y;
} p[N], q[N];
int x[N * 20];
pair<int, int> s[N * 20];
int cnt;

// Checker functions
void check_large_iteration(int range) {
    if (range > 1000000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Large iteration range may cause performance degradation!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_condition_frequency(int pos, int cnt) {
    if (pos > cnt) {
        cerr << "Warning: High frequency of condition checks detected!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_searchlight_coverage(int c_max, int a_max, int d_max, int b_max) {
    if (c_max > a_max && d_max > b_max) {
        cerr << "Warning: Extensive searchlight coverage may increase iteration count!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_initial_ans_value(int ans) {
    if (ans > 1000000) {
        cerr << "Warning: High initial value of ans may cause excessive iterations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin >> n >> m;
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) cin >> p[i].x >> p[i].y;
  for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) cin >> q[i].x >> q[i].y;

  // Check searchlight coverage
  int a_max = 0, b_max = 0, c_max = 0, d_max = 0;
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
      a_max = max(a_max, p[i].x);
      b_max = max(b_max, p[i].y);
  }
  for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
      c_max = max(c_max, q[i].x);
      d_max = max(d_max, q[i].y);
  }
  check_searchlight_coverage(c_max, a_max, d_max, b_max);

  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    for (int j = 1; j <= m; j++) {
      if (q[j].y >= p[i].y && q[j].x >= p[i].x) {
        s[++cnt] = {q[j].y - p[i].y + 1, q[j].x - p[i].x + 1};
      }
    }
  }
  sort(s + 1, s + 1 + cnt);

  for (int i = cnt; i >= 1; i--) x[i] = max(x[i + 1], s[i].second);

  int ans = 1000005, pos = 1;
  // Check initial ans value
  check_initial_ans_value(ans);

  for (int i = 0; i <= 1000000 && i < ans; i++) {
    check_large_iteration(i); // Check large iteration range
    while (pos <= cnt && s[pos].first <= i) pos++;
    check_condition_frequency(pos, cnt); // Check condition frequency
    ans = min(ans, i + x[pos]);
  }
  cout << ans << '\n';
  return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

- **Checker Placement:**
  - `check_large_iteration`: Placed inside the main loop to ensure the iteration range does not become too large.
  - `check_condition_frequency`: Placed inside the loop where condition checks are frequent.
  - `check_searchlight_coverage`: Placed after calculating maximum coordinates to validate extensive coverage.
  - `check_initial_ans_value`: Placed right after initialization to catch high initial values.

- **Warnings and Aborts:**
  - Each checker issues a warning and aborts if the condition is met, which helps in quickly identifying performance bottlenecks during testing and debugging.
