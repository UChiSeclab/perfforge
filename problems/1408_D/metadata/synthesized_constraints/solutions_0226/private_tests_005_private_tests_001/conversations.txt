system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

There are n robbers at coordinates (a_1, b_1), (a_2, b_2), ..., (a_n, b_n) and m searchlight at coordinates (c_1, d_1), (c_2, d_2), ..., (c_m, d_m). 

In one move you can move each robber to the right (increase a_i of each robber by one) or move each robber up (increase b_i of each robber by one). Note that you should either increase all a_i or all b_i, you can't increase a_i for some points and b_i for some other points.

Searchlight j can see a robber i if a_i ≤ c_j and b_i ≤ d_j. 

A configuration of robbers is safe if no searchlight can see a robber (i.e. if there is no pair i,j such that searchlight j can see a robber i).

What is the minimum number of moves you need to perform to reach a safe configuration?

Input

The first line of input contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000): the number of robbers and the number of searchlight.

Each of the next n lines contains two integers a_i, b_i (0 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^6), coordinates of robbers.

Each of the next m lines contains two integers c_i, d_i (0 ≤ c_i, d_i ≤ 10^6), coordinates of searchlights.

Output

Print one integer: the minimum number of moves you need to perform to reach a safe configuration.

Note

In the first test, you can move each robber to the right three times. After that there will be one robber in the coordinates (3, 0).

The configuration of the robbers is safe, because the only searchlight can't see the robber, because it is in the coordinates (2, 3) and 3 > 2.

In the second test, you can move each robber to the right two times and two times up. After that robbers will be in the coordinates (3, 8), (8, 3).

It's easy the see that the configuration of the robbers is safe.

It can be proved that you can't reach a safe configuration using no more than 3 moves.

assistant: ## Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Hit Count Analysis:**
   - The main difference in hit counts between the slow and fast inputs occurs in the `Upd` function, especially in the loop on line 65 (`for (int i = 0; i <= 1e6; i++)`).
   - The function `Upd()` is called `1,000,001` times for the slow input but only once for the fast input. This suggests that this loop is the primary source of the inefficiency for the slow input.

2. **Critical Code Segment:**
   - The `Upd` function (lines 13 to 27) is invoked many times due to the loop on line 65. This loop includes a potentially costly multiset operation (lines 19 and 26) and the logic within the `while` loop on line 15.

3. **Data Interaction and Complexity:**
   - The program is trying to find the minimum number of moves to ensure that no robber is visible to any searchlight. The `Upd` function updates the state by incrementing the `up` variable and adjusting the position of elements in the multisets `q` and `q2`.
   - The use of multisets suggests a complexity related to ordering or finding minimum/maximum values dynamically, which becomes costly when the loop iterates a large number of times.

## Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **Invariant 1: Large Coordinate Differences**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "When the coordinate differences between robbers and searchlights are large, the loop in the `Upd` function runs many times, slowing down the program. It is likely that if the maximum difference in coordinates exceeds a certain large threshold, the program will slow significantly."
   
2. **Invariant 2: High Iteration Count Due to Large Values**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "If the coordinates of any searchlight are much larger than the initial positions of all robbers, the program will enter a slow path, as it requires many iterations to move robbers out of visibility."

3. **Invariant 3: Inefficient Multiset Operations**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "Repeated insertion and removal from multisets can degrade performance when these operations are nested within a loop that runs for a large number of iterations, especially when elements in the multiset have large values."

4. **Invariant 4: Single Large Searchlight Influence**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "If any single searchlight has coordinates that are significantly larger than all robber coordinates, it will cause the loop within the `Upd` function to execute an excessive number of times, leading to a slowdown."

These invariants describe the conditions under which the given C program is likely to experience performance bottlenecks, suggesting that significant coordinate differences or disproportionately large searchlight coordinates relative to robbers' positions are potential triggers for slowdown. The focus on operation within the `Upd` function highlights the inefficiency arising from repeated multiset operations under these circumstances.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
There are n robbers at coordinates (a_1, b_1), (a_2, b_2), ..., (a_n, b_n) and m searchlight at coordinates (c_1, d_1), (c_2, d_2), ..., (c_m, d_m). 

In one move you can move each robber to the right (increase a_i of each robber by one) or move each robber up (increase b_i of each robber by one). Note that you should either increase all a_i or all b_i, you can't increase a_i for some points and b_i for some other points.

Searchlight j can see a robber i if a_i ≤ c_j and b_i ≤ d_j. 

A configuration of robbers is safe if no searchlight can see a robber (i.e. if there is no pair i,j such that searchlight j can see a robber i).

What is the minimum number of moves you need to perform to reach a safe configuration?

Input

The first line of input contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000): the number of robbers and the number of searchlight.

Each of the next n lines contains two integers a_i, b_i (0 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^6), coordinates of robbers.

Each of the next m lines contains two integers c_i, d_i (0 ≤ c_i, d_i ≤ 10^6), coordinates of searchlights.

Output

Print one integer: the minimum number of moves you need to perform to reach a safe configuration.

11 5


Output


6

Note

In the first test, you can move each robber to the right three times. After that there will be one robber in the coordinates (3, 0).

The configuration of the robbers is safe, because the only searchlight can't see the robber, because it is in the coordinates (2, 3) and 3 > 2.

In the second test, you can move each robber to the right two times and two times up. After that robbers will be in the coordinates (3, 8), (8, 3).

It's easy the see that the configuration of the robbers is safe.

It can be proved that you can't reach a safe configuration using no more than 3 moves.

assistant: Sure, let's proceed with implementing the performance-characterizing invariants as runtime checks in C++.

## Phase 3: Implement the Natural Language Invariants in C++

Based on the natural language invariants derived, let's write C++ code snippets that implement these checks:

```cpp
void check_large_coordinate_difference(int maxRobberX, int maxRobberY, int maxSearchlightX, int maxSearchlightY) {
    if ((maxSearchlightX - maxRobberX > 100000) || (maxSearchlightY - maxRobberY > 100000)) {
        cerr << "Warning: Large coordinate difference detected!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_high_iteration_due_to_large_values(int maxSearchlightX, int maxSearchlightY) {
    if (maxSearchlightX > 100000 || maxSearchlightY > 100000) {
        cerr << "Warning: High iteration count due to large searchlight values!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_inefficient_multiset_operations(int qSize, int threshold = 1000) {
    if (qSize > threshold) {
        cerr << "Warning: Inefficient multiset operations detected!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_single_large_searchlight_influence(int maxSearchlightX, int maxSearchlightY, int maxRobberX, int maxRobberY) {
    if ((maxSearchlightX > maxRobberX * 10) || (maxSearchlightY > maxRobberY * 10)) {
        cerr << "Warning: Single large searchlight influence detected!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

## Phase 4: Integrate the Checkers with the Original Program

Now, we'll integrate these checks into the given C++ program. These checks should be placed at strategic points, such as after input parsing or before heavy computation, but not within tight loops to avoid performance degradation.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int n, m, nn, mm, ans = 1e8, up = 0, nxt[2005];
struct P {
    int x, y;
} aa[2005], bb[2005], a[2005], b[2005];
struct T {
    int id, x;
    bool operator<(const T t) const { return x != t.x ? x < t.x : id < t.id; }
};
multiset<int> q;
multiset<T> q2;

void check_large_coordinate_difference(int maxRobberX, int maxRobberY, int maxSearchlightX, int maxSearchlightY) {
    if ((maxSearchlightX - maxRobberX > 100000) || (maxSearchlightY - maxRobberY > 100000)) {
        cerr << "Warning: Large coordinate difference detected!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_high_iteration_due_to_large_values(int maxSearchlightX, int maxSearchlightY) {
    if (maxSearchlightX > 100000 || maxSearchlightY > 100000) {
        cerr << "Warning: High iteration count due to large searchlight values!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_inefficient_multiset_operations(int qSize, int threshold = 1000) {
    if (qSize > threshold) {
        cerr << "Warning: Inefficient multiset operations detected!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_single_large_searchlight_influence(int maxSearchlightX, int maxSearchlightY, int maxRobberX, int maxRobberY) {
    if ((maxSearchlightX > maxRobberX * 10) || (maxSearchlightY > maxRobberY * 10)) {
        cerr << "Warning: Single large searchlight influence detected!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void Upd() {
    up++;
    while (q2.size() && up >= (q2.begin()->x)) {
        T tmp = *q2.begin();
        int i = tmp.id;
        q2.erase(q2.begin());
        q.erase(q.find(b[nxt[i]].x - a[i].x + 1));
        nxt[i]--;
        if (b[nxt[i]].x < a[i].x) nxt[i] = 0;
        if (nxt[i])
            q2.insert({i, b[nxt[i]].y - a[i].y + 1}),
            q.insert(b[nxt[i]].x - a[i].x + 1);
    }
    if (q.size()) ans = min(ans, up + *--q.end());
}

int main() {
    cin >> nn >> mm;
    int maxRobberX = 0, maxRobberY = 0, maxSearchlightX = 0, maxSearchlightY = 0;

    for (int i = 1; i <= nn; i++) {
        cin >> aa[i].x >> aa[i].y;
        maxRobberX = max(maxRobberX, aa[i].x);
        maxRobberY = max(maxRobberY, aa[i].y);

    }

    // Insert invariant checks after input parsing
    check_large_coordinate_difference(maxRobberX, maxRobberY, maxSearchlightX, maxSearchlightY);
    check_high_iteration_due_to_large_values(maxSearchlightX, maxSearchlightY);
    check_single_large_searchlight_influence(maxSearchlightX, maxSearchlightY, maxRobberX, maxRobberY);

    sort(aa + 1, aa + nn + 1,
         [](P i, P j) { return i.x != j.x ? i.x < j.x : i.y < j.y; });
    sort(bb + 1, bb + mm + 1,

    for (int i = nn; i >= 1; i--) {
        bool f = 0;
        for (int j = i - 1; j >= 1; j--) {
            if (aa[i].x >= aa[j].x && aa[i].y >= aa[j].y) f = 1;
        }
        if (!f) a[++n] = aa[i];
    }

    for (int i = 1; i <= mm; i++) {
        bool f = 0;

    }

    if (!q.size()) {
        cout << 0;
        return 0;
    }

    // Check size of multiset operations before entering the main loop
    check_inefficient_multiset_operations(q.size());

    ans = *--q.end();
    for (int i = 0; i <= 1e6; i++) {

### Explanation of Inserted Checks

- **`check_large_coordinate_difference` and `check_high_iteration_due_to_large_values`:** Placed right after input parsing. These checks are critical to ensure the input does not cause the code to enter a high iteration count scenario.

- **`check_inefficient_multiset_operations`:** Placed before main loop execution, this check ensures that the multiset operations do not degrade performance due to excessive size.

- **`check_single_large_searchlight_influence`:** Also placed after input parsing to detect if any single searchlight may adversely influence the computation due to disproportionately larger coordinates.

Each of these checks is designed to preemptively halt the program if certain conditions are met, indicating potential performance bottlenecks.
