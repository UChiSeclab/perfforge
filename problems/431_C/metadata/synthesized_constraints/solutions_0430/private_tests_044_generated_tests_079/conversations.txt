system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

Quite recently a creative student Lesha had a lecture on trees. After the lecture Lesha was inspired and came up with the tree of his own which he called a k-tree.

A k-tree is an infinite rooted tree where:

  * each vertex has exactly k children; 
  * each edge has some weight; 
  * if we look at the edges that goes from some vertex to its children (exactly k edges), then their weights will equal 1, 2, 3, ..., k. 



The picture below shows a part of a 3-tree.

<image>

As soon as Dima, a good friend of Lesha, found out about the tree, he immediately wondered: "How many paths of total weight n (the sum of all weights of the edges in the path) are there, starting from the root of a k-tree and also containing at least one edge of weight at least d?".

Help Dima find an answer to his question. As the number of ways can be rather large, print it modulo 1000000007 (109 + 7). 

Input

A single line contains three space-separated integers: n, k and d (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 100; 1 ≤ d ≤ k).

Output

Print a single integer — the answer to the problem modulo 1000000007 (109 + 7).

assistant: To diagnose the performance bottlenecks in the given C program, we need to analyze the given hit counts of each line during the "fast" and "slow" inputs and derive performance-characterizing invariants.

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Comparison of Hit Counts**:
   - The `dfs` function, particularly lines 7 through 20, shows significantly higher hit counts for the slow input compared to the fast input.
   - The loop at line 16 (`for (int v = 1; v <= k; ++v)`) is executed extremely frequently with the slow input, indicating that the recursive depth and the number of iterations per depth are causing the slowdown.
   - Specifically, line 18 (`res = (res + dfs(rank + 1, sum + v, check | (v >= d))) % mod;`) is a hotspot, showing that the function recursively calls itself many times without reaching a base case efficiently for the slow input.

2. **Interaction with Data Structures and Input Constraints**:
   - The recursive DFS approach is highly influenced by parameters `n` and `k`. Larger values of `n` and `k` lead to more recursion and iterations, exacerbating the slowdown.
   - The input constraints (e.g., `n <= 100`) suggest that the recursion could explore a wide search space, particularly when `n` and `k` are large.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the analysis, here are the natural language performance invariants that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path:

1. **Invariant #1: High Recursion Depth with Large Search Space**:
   - **Natural language description**: "When the values of `n` and `k` are both large, the depth and breadth of recursion significantly increase, leading to a high number of recursive calls. This situation arises especially when `n` is close to its maximum constraint and `k` is large, causing extensive exploration of paths in the k-tree."

2. **Invariant #2: Inefficient Handling of Large `k` with Small `d`**:
   - **Natural language description**: "If `k` is large but `d` is relatively small, many paths are explored that include edges of smaller weights before finding a path with the necessary weight. This results in excessive recursive exploration due to the high branching factor associated with large `k`."

3. **Invariant #3: Accumulation of Paths with High Weight Requirement**:
   - **Natural language description**: "When the path weight `n` is high and the condition for including an edge of weight at least `d` makes early termination of recursion rare, the function spends excessive time accumulating possible paths."

These invariants provide a high-level understanding of what can cause the program to slow down, without relying on specific numeric inputs, but rather focusing on the relationships between the input parameters and the recursive nature of the solution.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
Quite recently a creative student Lesha had a lecture on trees. After the lecture Lesha was inspired and came up with the tree of his own which he called a k-tree.

A k-tree is an infinite rooted tree where:

  * each vertex has exactly k children; 
  * each edge has some weight; 
  * if we look at the edges that goes from some vertex to its children (exactly k edges), then their weights will equal 1, 2, 3, ..., k. 



The picture below shows a part of a 3-tree.

<image>

As soon as Dima, a good friend of Lesha, found out about the tree, he immediately wondered: "How many paths of total weight n (the sum of all weights of the edges in the path) are there, starting from the root of a k-tree and also containing at least one edge of weight at least d?".

Help Dima find an answer to his question. As the number of ways can be rather large, print it modulo 1000000007 (109 + 7). 

Input

A single line contains three space-separated integers: n, k and d (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 100; 1 ≤ d ≤ k).

assistant: ### Phase 3: Implement Checker Code in C++

Below are implementations of the performance-characterizing invariants as C++ code snippets. These snippets are designed to check the conditions identified in Phase 2.

```cpp
// Checker for Invariant #1: High Recursion Depth with Large Search Space
void check_high_recursion_depth(int n, int k) {
    if (n >= 90 && k >= 90) {  // Threshold adjusted within input constraints
        cerr << "Warning: High recursion depth with large search space!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Checker for Invariant #2: Inefficient Handling of Large `k` with Small `d`
void check_large_k_small_d(int k, int d) {
    if (k >= 90 && d < k / 2) {  // Example threshold: large k but d smaller than half of k
        cerr << "Warning: Inefficient handling of large k with small d!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Checker for Invariant #3: Accumulation of Paths with High Weight Requirement
void check_high_weight_requirement(int n, int d) {
    if (n >= 95 && d >= 5) {  // Emphasizing larger n with a minimum d
        cerr << "Warning: High weight requirement causes excessive path accumulation!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrate Checkers into Original C++ Program

Here is the instrumented C++ code that integrates the performance-checking snippets into the original program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

const int N = 1e2 + 1;
const int mod = 1e9 + 7;
int n, k, d, f[N + 1][N][2], x[N];

inline void add(int& src, const int& dt) {
    src = (src % mod + dt % mod) % mod;
}

void check_high_recursion_depth(int n, int k) {
    if (n >= 90 && k >= 90) {  // Threshold adjusted within input constraints
        cerr << "Warning: High recursion depth with large search space!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_large_k_small_d(int k, int d) {
    if (k >= 90 && d < k / 2) {  // Example threshold: large k but d smaller than half of k
        cerr << "Warning: Inefficient handling of large k with small d!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_high_weight_requirement(int n, int d) {
    if (n >= 95 && d >= 5) {  // Emphasizing larger n with a minimum d
        cerr << "Warning: High weight requirement causes excessive path accumulation!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int dfs(int rank, int sum, int check) {
    if (sum > n) return 0;
    int& res = f[rank][sum][check];
    if (~res) return res;
    res = 0;
    if (sum == n) {
        if (!check) return res = 0;
        return res = 1;
    }
    for (int v = 1; v <= k; ++v) {
        x[rank] = v;
        res = (res + dfs(rank + 1, sum + v, check | (v >= d))) % mod;
    }
    return res;
}

int main() {
    scanf("%d%d%d", &n, &k, &d);

    // Insert checkers to diagnose potential performance issues
    check_high_recursion_depth(n, k);  // Check for high recursion depth
    check_large_k_small_d(k, d);       // Check for inefficient handling of large k with small d
    check_high_weight_requirement(n, d); // Check for high weight requirement

    memset(f, -1, sizeof f);
    cout << dfs(1, 0, 0);
    return 0;
}
```

**Comments on the Integration:**
- Checkers are placed after reading inputs to avoid adding overhead within the DFS function's recursive calls.
- Each checker is tailored to capture potential performance bottlenecks as described in their respective natural language invariants.
- This integration allows a fuzzer or tester to detect scenarios leading to slow performance by causing the program to abort with a clear diagnostic message.
