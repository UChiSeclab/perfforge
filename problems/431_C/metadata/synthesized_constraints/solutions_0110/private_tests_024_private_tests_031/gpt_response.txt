### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

**Analysis of Hit Counts:**

- The `getval` function is the primary function being called recursively. It has a significantly high hit count, particularly on lines related to recursion and memoization.
- Lines showing particularly high hit counts:
  - **Line 28** (`getval` function declaration): 495,101 (slow) vs. 101 (fast)
  - **Line 42** (for loop iterating over children): 500,051 (slow) vs. 101 (fast)
  - **Line 43** (recursive call within loop): 495,100 (slow) vs. 100 (fast)
  - **Line 44** (modular operation after recursion): 495,100 (slow) vs. 100 (fast)

These hit counts indicate that the recursive function, `getval`, is being called repeatedly, exploring a large space of possibilities. The recursion goes deep likely due to high values of `n` and `k`, especially when `n` is close to its upper limit of 100.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the analysis, the following invariants can be derived to characterize conditions under which the code experiences slow performance:

1. **Deep Recursion Due to Large `n`:**
   - **Invariant:** "If `n` is large, approaching its maximum constraint, and the value of `k` allows multiple paths to be considered, the recursion depth increases significantly, causing slow execution."
   - **Explanation:** As `n` grows larger, the number of potential paths and recursive calls increases exponentially, especially with a higher branching factor (`k`).

2. **High Branching Factor:**
   - **Invariant:** "When `k` is large, close to its upper constraint, the branching factor of the recursion is high, leading to many recursive calls and significant computation."
   - **Explanation:** A large `k` results in many possible child nodes per recursive call, expanding the search space exponentially.

3. **Memoization Inefficiency:**
   - **Invariant:** "Memoization may become less efficient if many states (`n`, `m`) are explored before values are reused, causing excessive recomputation."
   - **Explanation:** Despite memoization, if the number of unique states due to high `n` and `k` exceeds typical cases, recomputation can still become a bottleneck.

4. **Weight Constraint and Path Validity:**
   - **Invariant:** "If `d` is small relative to `k`, more paths need to be explored to find a valid path containing an edge >= `d`, increasing computational effort."
   - **Explanation:** A smaller `d` increases the likelihood that longer paths must be considered before finding an eligible path, increasing the number of recursive calls needed.

These invariants help explain why the slow input (`100 100 1`) leads to a large number of recursive calls and, subsequently, long execution times, in contrast to the fast input (`1 100 1`).

### Phase 3: Implement the Natural Language Invariants in C++

Based on the previously derived natural language invariants, we can implement C++ checks for these performance bottlenecks. Here are the runtime checks for each invariant:

1. **Deep Recursion Due to Large `n`:**
   ```cpp
   void check_large_n_invariant(int n) {
       if (n > 90) { // A threshold close to the upper limit
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered! - Large n causing deep recursion" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **High Branching Factor:**
   ```cpp
   void check_high_k_invariant(int k) {
       if (k > 90) { // A threshold close to the upper limit
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered! - High branching factor" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Memoization Inefficiency:**
   ```cpp
   void check_memoization_invariant(int n, int k) {
       if (n > 90 && k > 90) { // Combined effect of large n and k
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered! - Memoization inefficiency" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

4. **Weight Constraint and Path Validity:**
   ```cpp
   void check_weight_constraint_invariant(int d, int k) {
       if (d < k / 2) { // `d` considerably less than `k`
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered! - Path validity constraint" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Integrate the Checkers into the Original C++ Program

Now, let's integrate these checks into the original C++ program, placing them strategically to not interfere with performance in critical loops:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
using ll = long long;
using ld = long double;
using uint = unsigned int;
using ull = unsigned long long;
template <typename T>
using pair2 = pair<T, T>;
using pii = pair<int, int>;
using pli = pair<ll, int>;
using pll = pair<ll, ll>;
using mii = map<int, int>;
using mll = map<ll, ll>;
using vi = vector<int>;
using vl = vector<ll>;

int dp[1001][1001];

void check_large_n_invariant(int n) {
    if (n > 90) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered! - Large n causing deep recursion" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_high_k_invariant(int k) {
    if (k > 90) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered! - High branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_memoization_invariant(int n, int k) {
    if (n > 90 && k > 90) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered! - Memoization inefficiency" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_weight_constraint_invariant(int d, int k) {
    if (d < k / 2) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered! - Path validity constraint" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int getval(int n, int k, int d, int m) {
    if (n < 0) {
        return 0;
    }
    if (dp[n][m] != -1) {
        return dp[n][m];
    }
    if (n == 0) {
        if (m >= d) {
            return 1;
        }
        return 0;
    }
    int ans = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= k; i++) {
        ans += getval(n - i, k, d, max(m, i));
        ans %= 1000000007;
    }
    ans %= 1000000007;
    return dp[n][m] = ans;
}

void solve() {
    memset((dp), (-1), sizeof(dp));
    int n, k, d;
    cin >> n >> k >> d;

    // Insert checks after reading inputs
    check_large_n_invariant(n);
    check_high_k_invariant(k);
    check_memoization_invariant(n, k);
    check_weight_constraint_invariant(d, k);

    cout << getval(n, k, d, 0);
}

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL), cout.tie(NULL);
    solve();
}
```

**Explanation of Check Placement:**
- The checks are placed right after reading the input values, ensuring that they do not introduce any additional overhead inside critical loops or recursion.
- This setup ensures that the program will alert you to potential performance bottlenecks related to the input values before entering performance-critical sections of the code.
