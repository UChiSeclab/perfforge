=== Invariants Response ===
Based on the problem statement and the provided program, let's analyze the performance bottlenecks and derive performance-characterizing invariants.

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

Upon examining the hit counts for the slow and fast inputs, we observe:

1. **Function `go`:** The function `go` is called significantly more times for the slow input (815,761 times) compared to the fast input (1,486 times). This indicates that the recursion depth or the number of recursive calls is a major factor in the slowdown.

2. **Line `for (int i = 1; i <= k; i++)`:** The loop inside the recursive function `go` is executed 824,000 times for the slow input compared to 1,500 times for the fast input. This loop iterates over all possible weights (1 to `k`), and its repeated execution suggests a large branching factor.

3. **Lines checking conditions and memoization:** The condition checks and memoization (lines 7-13) are hit frequently, with the check for completed paths (`sum == n`) being hit 267,256 times in the slow case, indicating many partial paths are evaluated.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the analysis, here are some potential performance-characterizing invariants:

1. **High Recursive Depth with Large `n`:**
   - Natural language description: "If the path weight `n` is large relative to the branching factor `k`, the recursive exploration of paths becomes deep, leading to many recursive calls and potential slowdowns."

2. **Large Branching Factor:**
   - Natural language description: "When the branching factor `k` is large, the number of paths to explore increases exponentially, resulting in a significant increase in computational overhead, especially if `n` is also large."

3. **Ineffective Memoization with High `n`:**
   - Natural language description: "The effectiveness of memoization decreases when `n` is large, as more unique states are explored, leading to less reuse of previously computed results and increased redundant computations."

### Implementation Considerations

- **Recursive Call Overhead:** The recursive calls should be minimized by ensuring effective memoization and controlling the depth of recursion.
  
- **Branching Factor Impact:** Large values of `k` drastically increase the number of recursive paths, especially as `n` approaches its maximum constraint.

- **Memoization Efficiency:** Optimize memoization so that the same states are not recomputed, especially in cases where many paths share common sub-paths.

By focusing on these conditions and their impact on the recursive search space, we can better understand the performance issues and potentially optimize the code to handle such scenarios more efficiently.

=== Checker Response ===
### Phase 3: Implementing Checker Code

Below are the checker code snippets for the performance-characterizing invariants derived earlier:

1. **High Recursive Depth with Large `n`:**

   ```cpp
   void check_recursive_depth_invariant(int currentDepth, int n, int k) {
       if (currentDepth > 50 && n > 90) { // Example threshold based on problem constraints
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck triggered due to high recursive depth with large n!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Large Branching Factor:**

   ```cpp
   void check_branching_factor_invariant(int k, int n) {
       if (k > 80 && n > 90) { // Example threshold based on problem constraints
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck triggered due to large branching factor!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Ineffective Memoization with High `n`:**

   ```cpp
   void check_memoization_invariant(int uniqueStatesCount, int n) {
       if (uniqueStatesCount > 10000 && n > 90) { // Example threshold for unique states
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck triggered due to ineffective memoization!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Integrating Checkers into the Program

Here is the modified C++ program with the integrated checker code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
const int mod = 1e9 + 7;
int n, k, d;
int dp[105][105][2];

void check_recursive_depth_invariant(int currentDepth, int n, int k) {
    if (currentDepth > 50 && n > 90) { // Example threshold based on problem constraints
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck triggered due to high recursive depth with large n!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_branching_factor_invariant(int k, int n) {
    if (k > 80 && n > 90) { // Example threshold based on problem constraints
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck triggered due to large branching factor!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int go(int cur = 0, int sum = 0, bool has = 0) {
  check_recursive_depth_invariant(cur, n, k); // Check for recursive depth
  if (sum > n) {
    return 0;
  } else if (has && sum == n) {
    return 1;
  }
  if (dp[cur][sum][has] != -1) {
    return dp[cur][sum][has];
  }
  dp[cur][sum][has] = 0;
  for (int i = 1; i <= k; i++) {
    dp[cur][sum][has] =
        (0LL + dp[cur][sum][has] + go(cur + 1, sum + i, (i >= d) | has)) % mod;
  }
  return dp[cur][sum][has];
}

int main() {
  cin >> n >> k >> d;
  check_branching_factor_invariant(k, n); // Check for branching factor
  for (int i = 0; i <= 101; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j <= 101; j++) {
      for (int k = 0; k < 2; k++) {
        dp[i][j][k] = -1;
      }
    }
  }
  cout << go() << "\n";
  return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

- **Check for High Recursive Depth:** The function `check_recursive_depth_invariant` is called at the start of the recursive function `go` to ensure the recursion depth doesn't exceed a threshold when `n` is large.

- **Check for Large Branching Factor:** The function `check_branching_factor_invariant` is called in `main` after reading the input values for `n` and `k` to detect potential slowdowns due to a large branching factor.

By integrating these checks, we aim to catch conditions that could lead to performance bottlenecks dynamically and alert the developer to potential inefficiencies in the code execution paths.
