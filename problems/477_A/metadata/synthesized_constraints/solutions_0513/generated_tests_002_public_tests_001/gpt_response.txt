### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

Based on the provided hit count information, the main performance bottleneck of the program occurs inside the loop on lines 9-24. Here's a breakdown of the key insights:

1. **Loop Over `t1` (Line 9):** The loop iterates from 1 to `b - 1`. For the slow input, where `b = 18270115`, this results in 18,270,114 iterations. This is significantly higher than the fast input, where `b = 2`, resulting in only 1 iteration.

2. **Conditional Check (Line 10):** The condition `if (a % 2 == 0)` is hit as often as the loop itself in the slow input, indicating most of the time `a` is even (which matches the input `a = 2`).

3. **Complex Calculations (Lines 11-24):** Operations inside the loop, including modulo operations and multiplications, are performed 18,270,114 times in the slow input scenario. These are computationally expensive, especially when executed repeatedly in a loop of this size.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Given the analysis, here are natural language invariants describing conditions that lead to slowdowns:

1. **Excessive Iteration Through Large Input Range:**
   - **Invariant:** "When the value of `b` is large, nearing the constraint threshold, and `a` is even, the loop iterating over `t1` becomes extensive, significantly increasing execution time due to repeated complex calculations."

2. **Inefficient Use of Arithmetic Operations in Large Loops:**
   - **Invariant:** "If the loop iterating over `t1` involves extensive arithmetic operations, including multiple modulo and multiplication operations, it can cause computational inefficiencies, especially when `b` is large, resulting in a high number of iterations."

3. **Dependence on Modulo Operations:**
   - **Invariant:** "Given the heavy reliance on modulo operations within the loop, performance may degrade when the loop iterates a large number of times, leading to an accumulation of overhead from these operations."

These invariants demonstrate how the structure and size of the input, specifically the variable `b`, influence the performance of the code due to extensive looping and arithmetic computations. They abstractly capture the conditions under which the code could slow down, especially when approaching problem constraints.

### Phase 3: Implement Checker Code in C++

Based on the natural language invariants derived earlier, here are the C++ functions to check these conditions at runtime.

```cpp
void check_large_b_invariant(long long b) {
    if (b > 10000000) {  // Threshold chosen based on the constraint
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - b is large!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_loop_invariant(long long b, long long t1, long long a) {
    if ((b > 10000000) && (t1 == b - 1) && (a % 2 == 0)) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - extensive loop with large b!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_modulo_operations_invariant(long long iterations) {
    if (iterations > 10000000) {  // Arbitrarily chosen threshold for excessive iterations
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive modulo operations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrate Checker Code into the Program

Now, integrate the checker functions into the original C++ program at appropriate locations.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Check function for large b
void check_large_b_invariant(long long b) {
    if (b > 10000000) {  // Threshold chosen based on the constraint
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - b is large!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Check function for loop conditions
void check_loop_invariant(long long b, long long t1, long long a) {
    if ((b > 10000000) && (t1 == b - 1) && (a % 2 == 0)) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - extensive loop with large b!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Check function for excessive iterations
void check_modulo_operations_invariant(long long iterations) {
    if (iterations > 10000000) {  // Arbitrarily chosen threshold for excessive iterations
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive modulo operations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    long long a, b;
    while (scanf("%lld%lld", &a, &b) != -1) {
        // Check if b is excessively large before entering the loop
        check_large_b_invariant(b);
        
        long long t, t1;
        long long sum = 0;
        long long k1, k2;
        long long iteration_count = 0;  // To track the number of iterations
        
        for (t1 = 1; t1 < b; t1++) {
            iteration_count++;
            
            if (a % 2 == 0) {
                k1 = a / 2;
                k2 = (a * t1 + t1);
            } else {
                k1 = (a * t1 + t1) / 2;
                k2 = a;
            }
            
            long long p = ((((((k1 % 1000000007) * (k2 % 1000000007)) % 1000000007) %
                           1000000007) * (b % 1000000007)) %
                         1000000007 + (((a % 1000000007) * (t1 % 1000000007)) % 1000000007)) % 1000000007;
            
            sum = sum % 1000000007;
            sum = (p + sum) % 1000000007;
            
            // Check conditions inside the loop
            check_loop_invariant(b, t1, a);
        }
        
        // Check if the number of iterations is excessively high
        check_modulo_operations_invariant(iteration_count);
        
        cout << sum << endl;
    }
}
```

### Explanation

- **`check_large_b_invariant`:** This checks if `b` is close to the upper constraint, which would likely trigger excessive iterations.
- **`check_loop_invariant`:** Placed inside the loop to detect when `t1` reaches its maximum and `a` is even, which is a heavy computation scenario.
- **`check_modulo_operations_invariant`:** Used to monitor if the number of loop iterations exceeds a threshold indicative of excessive operations.

Each check is strategically placed to detect conditions that lead to slowdowns without adding significant overhead during execution.
