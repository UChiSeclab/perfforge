system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

Dreamoon loves summing up something for no reason. One day he obtains two integers a and b occasionally. He wants to calculate the sum of all nice integers. Positive integer x is called nice if <image> and <image>, where k is some integer number in range [1, a].

By <image> we denote the quotient of integer division of x and y. By <image> we denote the remainder of integer division of x and y. You can read more about these operations here: http://goo.gl/AcsXhT.

The answer may be large, so please print its remainder modulo 1 000 000 007 (109 + 7). Can you compute it faster than Dreamoon?

Input

The single line of the input contains two integers a, b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 107).

assistant: ### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Line-Level Hit Counts Analysis:**
   - The `for` loop on line 45 is hit 18,270,115 times for the slow input compared to just once for the fast input. This indicates that this loop is the main factor contributing to the slowdown.
   - Lines within this loop (46-60) are executed a similar number of times as the loop iterations, suggesting heavy operations within each iteration.

2. **Code Segment Analysis:**
   - The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i < b`, meaning the number of iterations is directly proportional to the value of `b`.
   - Within the loop, operations involve multiple modulo calculations and multiplications, which, while efficient in isolation, accumulate overhead when repeated millions of times.
   - The operations on lines 46-60 involve arithmetic and condition checks, which are repeated in every iteration, thus contributing to the inefficiency.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the analysis, we can formulate the following performance invariants:

1. **Invariant 1: Large Iteration Count**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "If the value of `b` is very large, causing the loop to iterate a massive number of times, the program may experience significant slowdowns due to repeated arithmetic operations."
   - **Threshold Suggestion:** Since the problem constraints allow `b` up to \(10^7\), consider thresholds where `b` approaches the upper limits, e.g., `b > 10^6`.

2. **Invariant 2: Arithmetic and Modulo Operations**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "When the loop iterates over a large range, the cumulative cost of modulo and multiplication operations for each iteration can lead to degraded performance, especially as `b` increases."
   - **Threshold Suggestion:** Look for conditions where `b` becomes significantly large, leading to noticeable performance degradation, potentially `b > 10^6`.

3. **Invariant 3: Conditional Branching Overhead**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "The overhead introduced by conditionally executing arithmetic operations based on the parity of `a` compounds when the loop runs a large number of times, impacting performance."
   - **Threshold Suggestion:** Since conditions are based on `a`, the impact is more notable as `b` increases. Consider scenarios where `b` is large and `a` leads to frequent condition switching, e.g., `b > 10^6`.

By understanding these conditions, future inputs leading to similar scenarios can be detected and mitigated, potentially by optimizing the loop's logic or rethinking how to handle large `b` values efficiently within the given constraints.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
Dreamoon loves summing up something for no reason. One day he obtains two integers a and b occasionally. He wants to calculate the sum of all nice integers. Positive integer x is called nice if <image> and <image>, where k is some integer number in range [1, a].

By <image> we denote the quotient of integer division of x and y. By <image> we denote the remainder of integer division of x and y. You can read more about these operations here: http://goo.gl/AcsXhT.

The answer may be large, so please print its remainder modulo 1 000 000 007 (109 + 7). Can you compute it faster than Dreamoon?

Input

The single line of the input contains two integers a, b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 107).

Note

For the first sample, there are no nice integers because <image> is always zero.

Solution (C++ code):
{solution}


assistant: ### Phase 3: Implement the Natural Language Invariants in C++

Below are the C++ code snippets that check the conditions described by the performance-characterizing invariants from Phase 2. Each checker function implements one of the invariants.

```cpp
void check_large_b_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to large b!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_arithmetic_operations_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to costly arithmetic operations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_conditional_branching_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to conditional branching!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrate the Checker Code into the Original Program

The following is the instrumented C++ code. I have strategically placed the checker functions to avoid adding overhead in tight loops. Comments are included to explain the purpose of each check.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Checker functions for performance bottlenecks

void check_large_b_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to large b!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_arithmetic_operations_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to costly arithmetic operations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_conditional_branching_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to conditional branching!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    long long aa, b;
    cin >> aa >> b;

    // Check for large 'b' causing excessive loop iterations
    check_large_b_invariant(b > 1000000);

    long long i;
    long long mod = 1000000007;
    long long sum = 0;

    // Check for costly arithmetic operations based on 'b'
    check_arithmetic_operations_invariant(b > 1000000);

    for (i = 1; i < b; i++) {
        long long first = ((i * b) % mod + i) % mod;
        long long k1 = (aa * first) % mod;
        long long p, d;
        long long m = (i * b) % mod;

        // Check for conditional branching overhead
        check_conditional_branching_invariant(b > 1000000 && aa % 2 != 0);

        if (aa % 2 == 0) {
            p = aa / 2;
            p = (p * (aa - 1)) % mod;
            d = (p * m) % mod;
        } else {
            p = (aa - 1) / 2;
            p = (p * (aa)) % mod;
            d = (p * m) % mod;
        }
        long long s = (k1 + d) % mod;
        sum = (sum + s) % mod;
    }
    cout << sum << "\n";
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Large `b` Invariant:**
   - The `check_large_b_invariant` function is called right after reading input to ensure `b` is not excessively large, which would cause a high number of loop iterations.

2. **Costly Arithmetic Operations Invariant:**
   - The `check_arithmetic_operations_invariant` is positioned before entering the loop to catch cases where the arithmetic operations might become too resource-intensive due to a large `b`.

3. **Conditional Branching Invariant:**
   - The `check_conditional_branching_invariant` is placed inside the loop, but right before the condition check for `aa % 2`, to see if branching is indeed causing a slowdown with large `b` values and when `aa` is odd. 

These checkers will help in identifying when performance bottlenecks occur, providing valuable information for optimization and debugging.
