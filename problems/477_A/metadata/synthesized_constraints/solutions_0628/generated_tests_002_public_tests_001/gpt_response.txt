### Phase 1: Identifying Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

By comparing the line-level hit counts for the fast and slow runs, we can pinpoint the following observations:

1. **Loop Execution**:  
   - The loop on line 17, `for (int(q) = (1); (q) < (int)(b); ++(q))`, executes 18,270,115 times for the slow input versus just 2 times for the fast input. This indicates that the loop is potentially the primary source of the slowdown, as its iterations are directly proportional to the value of `b`.

2. **Function Calls Inside the Loop**:
   - The `mul` and `add` functions are called multiple times within the loop (lines 18 and 19). Each function call is hit 36,540,228 times in total. These operations, although modular, accumulate a significant computational overhead when executed repeatedly in a loop with a high iteration count.

### Phase 2: Deriving Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the analysis, we can derive natural language invariants to describe conditions under which the program is likely to enter a slow path:

1. **Invariant #1: High Loop Iterations**
   - **Natural Language Description**: When the number `b` is large (approaching the upper constraint of 10 million), the loop iterating over `q` (from 1 to `b`) will execute a significant number of times. This can cause the program to slow down considerably, as the operations inside the loop are repeated excessively.
   - **Code Context**: The performance slowdown is primarily due to the loop iterating extensively with each increment of `q` causing multiple function invocations.

2. **Invariant #2: Accumulated Arithmetic Operations**
   - **Natural Language Description**: If each loop iteration involves multiple arithmetic operations, especially modular arithmetic which, although efficient for small numbers, accumulates overhead when executed frequently within a high iteration loop, the overall performance may degrade, particularly when `b` is large.
   - **Code Context**: The operations `mul` and `add` are invoked twice per iteration, leading to computational bottlenecks due to repetitive calculations.

3. **Invariant #3: Quadratic-Like Complexity**
   - **Natural Language Description**: The combined effect of a large `b` and the operations inside the loop can lead to a performance scenario analogous to quadratic complexity, where the number of operations grows significantly with `b`. This is exacerbated when `a` also contributes to the arithmetic operations, although to a lesser extent compared to `b`.

These invariants highlight how the program's performance can degrade under certain conditions, namely when `b` is large, causing extensive repeated computations due to the nested arithmetic operations within a loop that scales linearly with `b`. By focusing on these patterns, we can identify potential slowdowns without depending on the specific input values from the slow run.

### Phase 3: Implementing the Natural Language Invariants in C++

The task is to translate the natural language invariants into C++ checker code. Here are the implementations for each invariant:

1. **Invariant #1: High Loop Iterations**

```cpp
void check_loop_iterations(long long b) {
    if (b > 1000000) {  // Arbitrary but large threshold for b
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high loop iterations due to large b!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

2. **Invariant #2: Accumulated Arithmetic Operations**

```cpp
void check_arithmetic_operations(long long a, long long b) {
    if (b * a > 10000000) {  // Threshold based on constraints and operation count
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive arithmetic operations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

3. **Invariant #3: Quadratic-Like Complexity**

```cpp
void check_complexity(long long a, long long b) {
    if (b * b > 10000000) {  // Threshold indicating potential quadratic-like complexity
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - potential quadratic complexity due to b!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrating Checker Code into the Original C++ Program

Here is the modified program with the checker functions integrated:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
const long long mod = (long long)1e9 + 7;

long long mul(long long a, long long b) {
    a %= mod, b %= mod;
    return a * b % mod;
}

long long add(long long a, long long b) {
    a %= mod, b %= mod;
    a += b, a %= mod;
    return a;
}

// Checker functions
void check_loop_iterations(long long b) {
    if (b > 1000000) {  // Arbitrary but large threshold for b
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high loop iterations due to large b!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_arithmetic_operations(long long a, long long b) {
    if (b * a > 10000000) {  // Threshold based on constraints and operation count
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive arithmetic operations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_complexity(long long a, long long b) {
    if (b * b > 10000000) {  // Threshold indicating potential quadratic-like complexity
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - potential quadratic complexity due to b!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main(int argc, char const *argv[]) {
    long long a, b;
    cin >> a >> b;

    // Checkers
    check_loop_iterations(b);  // Detects high loop iterations
    check_arithmetic_operations(a, b);  // Detects excessive arithmetic operations
    check_complexity(a, b);  // Detects complexity issues

    long long res = 0;
    for (int(q) = (1); (q) < (int)(b); ++(q)) {
        res = add(res, mul(mul(q, b), a * (a + 1) / 2));
        res = add(res, a * q);
    }
    cout << res << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of Instrumentation
- **`check_loop_iterations(b);`**: Placed after reading input to detect if `b` will cause excessive loop iterations.
- **`check_arithmetic_operations(a, b);`**: Checks immediately to see if the multiplication of `a` and `b` will lead to many operations.
- **`check_complexity(a, b);`**: Immediately checks for potential quadratic-like scenarios based on the size of `b`.

These checks help identify potential performance bottlenecks due to large inputs leading to expensive computations.
