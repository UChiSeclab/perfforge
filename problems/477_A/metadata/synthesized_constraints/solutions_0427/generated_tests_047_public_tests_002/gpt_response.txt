=== Invariants Response ===
To address the given problem and analyze the performance bottlenecks of the C code, let's follow the outlined phases and tasks:

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

Based on the provided hit count information, we can observe the following:

1. **Loop Execution (Line 11):** The loop `for (long long int m = 1; m < b; m++)` is the primary reason for the high execution time on the slow input, as it runs 18,270,115 times for `b = 18,270,115`.

2. **Multiplication Function (Line 6):** The function `mul(int a, int b)` is called multiple times within the loop, indicating that it might be contributing to the slowdown. Specifically, it is called five times per loop iteration (lines 12 and 13).

3. **Addition Function (Line 5):** The function `add(int a, int b)` is also frequently called within the loop, which adds up to the computational overhead.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

From the analysis, the primary performance bottleneck is the loop, which iterates over a range dependent on the value `b`. Here are some performance-characterizing invariants:

1. **Loop with High Iteration Count:**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "If the value of `b` is large, the loop iterates many times, causing the function calls within the loop to accumulate significant computational overhead."
   - **Threshold Suggestion:** Given the constraints `1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^7`, a critical slowdown can occur when `b` is a very large percentage of its upper bound.

2. **Frequent Multiplication with Large Numbers:**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "When `b` is large, frequent multiplication operations within the loop can lead to performance degradation, as they involve repeated computations with large integers."
   - **Threshold Suggestion:** The repeated multiplications become computationally expensive when `b` approaches its upper limit.

3. **Frequent Addition within a Loop:**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "If the loop iterates frequently with a high value of `b`, the repeated addition of large intermediate results can slow down the computation."
   - **Threshold Suggestion:** This is particularly critical when `b` is substantial, as frequent additions aggregate to a large number of operations.

### Conclusion

The primary performance issue arises from the loop iterating `b-1` times, especially when `b` is large. This leads to multiple calls to the multiplication and addition functions, resulting in significant computational overhead. By recognizing these invariants, we can better understand when the code is likely to slow down and consider optimization strategies, such as reducing the number of iterations or minimizing redundant calculations within the loop.

### Phase 3: Implementing the Natural Language Invariants as C++ Checkers

Based on the natural language invariants we derived earlier, here's how to implement them in C++:

1. **Loop with High Iteration Count:**
   - **Checker Code:**
     ```cpp
     void check_high_iteration_invariant(long long b) {
         if (b > 10000000 / 10) { // Arbitrary threshold that indicates high value of b
             cerr << "Warning: High iteration count due to large b value!" << endl;
             abort();
         }
     }
     ```

2. **Frequent Multiplication with Large Numbers:**
   - **Checker Code:**
     ```cpp
     void check_frequent_multiplication_invariant(long long a, long long b) {
         if (b > 10000000 / 10 && a > 10000000 / 10) { // Threshold indicating potential high-cost multiplications
             cerr << "Warning: Frequent multiplication with large numbers!" << endl;
             abort();
         }
     }
     ```

3. **Frequent Addition within a Loop:**
   - **Checker Code:**
     ```cpp
     void check_frequent_addition_invariant(long long b) {
         if (b > 10000000 / 10) { // Same threshold as iteration count due to overlap
             cerr << "Warning: Frequent addition operations in loop due to large b!" << endl;
             abort();
         }
     }
     ```

### Phase 4: Integrating the Checker Code with the Original Program

Now, let's integrate these checkers into the original C++ program at appropriate points.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
const int mod = (int)1e9 + 7;
const int d = mod / 2 + 1;
int add(int a, int b) { return (a + b) % mod; }
int mul(int a, int b) { return (long long int)a * b % mod; }

// Checker functions
void check_high_iteration_invariant(long long b) {
    if (b > 10000000 / 10) { // Arbitrary threshold
        cerr << "Warning: High iteration count due to large b value!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_frequent_multiplication_invariant(long long a, long long b) {
    if (b > 10000000 / 10 && a > 10000000 / 10) { // Threshold indicating potential high-cost multiplications
        cerr << "Warning: Frequent multiplication with large numbers!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_frequent_addition_invariant(long long b) {
    if (b > 10000000 / 10) { // Same threshold as iteration count
        cerr << "Warning: Frequent addition operations in loop due to large b!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    long long int a, b;
    scanf("%lld%lld", &a, &b);

    // Insert checkers
    check_high_iteration_invariant(b);
    check_frequent_multiplication_invariant(a, b);
    check_frequent_addition_invariant(b);

    long long int ans = 0;
    for (long long int m = 1; m < b; m++) {
        long long int sum_t = mul(mul(mul(m, a + 1), a), d);
        long long int cur_add = mul(b, sum_t) + mul(m, a);
        cur_add %= mod;
        ans = add(ans, cur_add);
    }
    printf("%lld\n", ans);
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

- **Check Placement:** The checkers are included before the loop where the bottleneck conditions are relevant. This ensures that the checks do not add overhead inside the tight loop.
- **Logical Thresholds:** The thresholds are set as a portion of the maximum constraint (`10^7`) to signal potential performance issues without relying on specific slow input values.
- **Utility:** These checks will help identify performance bottlenecks when the input parameters are large, offering insight for potential optimizations.
