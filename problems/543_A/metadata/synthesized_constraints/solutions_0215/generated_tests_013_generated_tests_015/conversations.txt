system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

Programmers working on a large project have just received a task to write exactly m lines of code. There are n programmers working on a project, the i-th of them makes exactly ai bugs in every line of code that he writes. 

Let's call a sequence of non-negative integers v1, v2, ..., vn a plan, if v1 + v2 + ... + vn = m. The programmers follow the plan like that: in the beginning the first programmer writes the first v1 lines of the given task, then the second programmer writes v2 more lines of the given task, and so on. In the end, the last programmer writes the remaining lines of the code. Let's call a plan good, if all the written lines of the task contain at most b bugs in total.

Your task is to determine how many distinct good plans are there. As the number of plans can be large, print the remainder of this number modulo given positive integer mod.

Input

The first line contains four integers n, m, b, mod (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500, 0 ≤ b ≤ 500; 1 ≤ mod ≤ 109 + 7) — the number of programmers, the number of lines of code in the task, the maximum total number of bugs respectively and the modulo you should use when printing the answer.

The next line contains n space-separated integers a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 500) — the number of bugs per line for each programmer.

Output

Print a single integer — the answer to the problem modulo mod.

assistant: To analyze the slowdown in the provided C program, we need to evaluate the hit counts and the logic of the program, especially focusing on the sections where the slow input has significantly more hits than the fast input. Here's a breakdown of the performance analysis:

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Hit Count Analysis**:
   - The `process()` function is the main focus. The nested loops in this function, particularly lines 13-19, show a significant increase in hit counts for the slow input compared to the fast input.
   - Line 13 (`for (int k = 0; k <= b; k++)`) has a hit count of 33,264 for the slow input versus 17,424 for the fast input, indicating that the number of iterations over `k` is a major factor in the slowdown.
   - Lines 15 and 17, which involve updating the dynamic programming table `F`, also show a high number of operations, almost double for the slow input.

2. **Potential Causes of Slowdown**:
   - The `k` loop iterates up to `b` and the condition `a[j + 1] + k <= b` controls the depth of iteration. If `b` is large or `a[j + 1]` values are small, this results in more iterations, contributing to the slowdown.
   - The high hit count on line 15 and 17 suggests that the dynamic programming table `F` is being updated excessively, leading to potential redundancy in operations.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the analysis, we can derive the following performance-characterizing invariants in natural language:

1. **Invariant 1**: "If the maximum allowed bugs (`b`) is significantly larger compared to the number of bugs per line (`a[i]`), the program may slow down due to increased iterations over potential plans. This is particularly noticeable when `b` approaches its upper constraint (500) while `a[i]` values are relatively low."

2. **Invariant 2**: "When the number of lines to be written (`m`) is large and combined with a high `b` value, the nested loops in the dynamic programming approach may lead to excessive iterations, thereby slowing down the execution. This is exacerbated if there is a large discrepancy between `m` and the sum of `a[i]` over possible plans."

3. **Invariant 3**: "If many programmers have low bug rates (`a[i]` values are small), this can result in frequent resets and updates to the dynamic programming matrix, leading to more computations. Thus, having many low-bug-rate programmers with a high bug threshold (`b`) can trigger slowdowns."

These invariants abstract the conditions leading to slow execution without relying on specific numbers from the input, ensuring they can flag similar performance issues in future scenarios.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
Programmers working on a large project have just received a task to write exactly m lines of code. There are n programmers working on a project, the i-th of them makes exactly ai bugs in every line of code that he writes. 

Let's call a sequence of non-negative integers v1, v2, ..., vn a plan, if v1 + v2 + ... + vn = m. The programmers follow the plan like that: in the beginning the first programmer writes the first v1 lines of the given task, then the second programmer writes v2 more lines of the given task, and so on. In the end, the last programmer writes the remaining lines of the code. Let's call a plan good, if all the written lines of the task contain at most b bugs in total.

Your task is to determine how many distinct good plans are there. As the number of plans can be large, print the remainder of this number modulo given positive integer mod.

Input

The first line contains four integers n, m, b, mod (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500, 0 ≤ b ≤ 500; 1 ≤ mod ≤ 109 + 7) — the number of programmers, the number of lines of code in the task, the maximum total number of bugs respectively and the modulo you should use when printing the answer.

The next line contains n space-separated integers a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 500) — the number of bugs per line for each programmer.

Output

Print a single integer — the answer to the problem modulo mod.

assistant: Let's break down the task into two phases as described.

### Phase 3: Implementing Invariants as Checkers

Based on the performance-characterizing invariants derived previously, here are the corresponding C++ snippets to act as runtime checks:

1. **Invariant 1 Checker**: Checks if the maximum allowed bugs (`b`) is significantly larger than the number of bugs per line (`a[i]`).
   ```cpp
   void check_bug_limit(int b, const vector<int>& a) {
       int min_a = *min_element(a.begin(), a.end());
       if (b > min_a * 10) { // Arbitrary threshold based on the description
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high bug limit!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Invariant 2 Checker**: Checks if the combination of `m` and `b` leads to excessive iterations.
   ```cpp
   void check_complexity(int m, int b) {
       if (m > 400 && b > 400) { // Thresholds based on input constraints
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high m and b values!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Invariant 3 Checker**: Checks for multiple low bug-rate programmers with a high bug threshold.
   ```cpp
   void check_low_bug_rate(int n, const vector<int>& a, int b) {
       int low_bug_programmers = count_if(a.begin(), a.end(), [](int x) { return x <= 2; });
       if (low_bug_programmers > n / 2 && b > 400) { // More than half low bug-rate
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - many low bug-rate programmers!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Integrating Checkers into the Original Program

Now, we will integrate these checks into the provided C++ program. The checks will be placed right after the inputs are read, before the main processing begins to ensure they do not add overhead during the critical computations.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
const int N = 501;
int n, m, b, mod, a[N], F[2][N][N];

void enter() {
  cin >> n >> m >> b >> mod;
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) cin >> a[i];
}

void check_bug_limit(int b, const vector<int>& a) {
    int min_a = *min_element(a.begin(), a.end());
    if (b > min_a * 10) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high bug limit!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_complexity(int m, int b) {
    if (m > 400 && b > 400) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high m and b values!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_low_bug_rate(int n, const vector<int>& a, int b) {
    int low_bug_programmers = count_if(a.begin(), a.end(), [](int x) { return x <= 2; });
    if (low_bug_programmers > n / 2 && b > 400) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - many low bug-rate programmers!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void process() {
  F[0][0][0] = 1;
  for (int i = 0; i <= m; i++)
    for (int j = 0; j <= n; j++)
      for (int k = 0; k <= b; k++) {
        if (j < n)
          F[i % 2][j + 1][k] = (F[i % 2][j + 1][k] + F[i % 2][j][k]) % mod;
        if (i < m && j < n && a[j + 1] + k <= b)
          F[(i + 1) % 2][j][k + a[j + 1]] =
              (F[(i + 1) % 2][j][k + a[j + 1]] + F[i % 2][j][k]) % mod;
        if (i < m) F[i % 2][j][k] = 0;
      }
}

void print() {
  int res = 0;
  for (int j = 0; j <= b; j++) res = (res + F[m % 2][n][j]) % mod;
  cout << res << endl;
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(NULL);
  enter();

  vector<int> a_vector(a + 1, a + n + 1);
  check_bug_limit(b, a_vector);  // Check if the bug limit is too high
  check_complexity(m, b);  // Check complexity threshold
  check_low_bug_rate(n, a_vector, b);  // Check for low bug-rate programmers

  process();
  print();
}
```

### Explanation

- **Placement of Checks**: All checks are placed after input reading, but before any processing begins. This ensures that potential performance bottlenecks are flagged early.
- **Comments**: Each check is commented with the specific performance bottleneck it detects.
- **Utility**: These checks help catch performance issues based on input configurations, guiding fuzzers or testers to spot inefficient scenarios.
