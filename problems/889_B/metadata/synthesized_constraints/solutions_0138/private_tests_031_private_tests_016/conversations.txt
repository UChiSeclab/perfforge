system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

A substring of some string is called the most frequent, if the number of its occurrences is not less than number of occurrences of any other substring.

You are given a set of strings. A string (not necessarily from this set) is called good if all elements of the set are the most frequent substrings of this string. Restore the non-empty good string with minimum length. If several such strings exist, restore lexicographically minimum string. If there are no good strings, print "NO" (without quotes).

A substring of a string is a contiguous subsequence of letters in the string. For example, "ab", "c", "abc" are substrings of string "abc", while "ac" is not a substring of that string.

The number of occurrences of a substring in a string is the number of starting positions in the string where the substring occurs. These occurrences could overlap.

String a is lexicographically smaller than string b, if a is a prefix of b, or a has a smaller letter at the first position where a and b differ.

Input

The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of strings in the set.

Each of the next n lines contains a non-empty string consisting of lowercase English letters. It is guaranteed that the strings are distinct.

The total length of the strings doesn't exceed 105.

Output

Print the non-empty good string with minimum length. If several good strings exist, print lexicographically minimum among them. Print "NO" (without quotes) if there are no good strings.

Examples

Input

4
mail
ai
lru
cf


Output

cfmailru


Input

3
kek
preceq
cheburek


Output

NO

Note

One can show that in the first sample only two good strings with minimum length exist: "cfmailru" and "mailrucf". The first string is lexicographically minimum.

assistant: ### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

Based on the provided hit counts from the slow and fast inputs, the following observations can be made:

1. **Function `combine`:** It is heavily invoked during the slow input run:
   - Lines related to the `combine` function (lines 6-26) are hit numerous times, particularly the loops (lines 9, 11, 13, 19, 22).

2. **Line-Level Observations:**
   - **Line 19 (`for (int i = (0); i < (100); i++)`):** This line's hit count (2525) indicates a potential performance bottleneck, as it is nested within the `combine` function.
   - **Line 22 (`for (int i = (0); i < (w.size()); i++)`):** This line is also executed frequently, contributing to the slowdown.
   - **Line 44 (`for (int i = (0); i < (26); i++)`):** The outer loop iterates over the alphabet. This loop calls `combine`, leading to repeated, potentially expensive operations.

3. **Data Structure and Algorithm Usage:**
   - The program uses a vector of characters (`res`) of fixed size 100, which is manipulated frequently, suggesting a potentially inefficient approach for building the good string.
   - Frequent checks and updates of masks and positional indices in this fixed-size vector can lead to inefficiencies as they are repeatedly performed.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the analysis, the following performance-characterizing invariants can be inferred:

1. **Frequent Character Set Invariant:**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "If the input strings collectively contain a large subset of the alphabet with frequent character overlaps, the algorithm may enter a slow path by repetitively checking and updating character positions."
   - **Implication:** The slowdown occurs when many strings share common characters, causing repeated iterations and checks for each character in the alphabet. This is exacerbated when the collective character set approaches the total alphabet size.

2. **Inefficient Vector Manipulation Invariant:**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "When constructing the good string involves many overlapping character positions in the vector `res`, the program may slow due to frequent character position updates and conflicts."
   - **Implication:** The fixed-size vector (`res`) operations become costly when there are many overlaps or conflicts between character placements, requiring frequent resolution of these conflicts.

3. **Alphabet Coverage Invariant:**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "If the input strings cover a significant portion of the alphabet (e.g., near or exactly 26 characters), the algorithm slows as it must examine each character for overlap and ordering."
   - **Implication:** The algorithm's performance degrades when the input's character diversity is high, leading to extensive calls to `combine` and checks for character conflicts.

By avoiding specific numeric values from the slow input and considering thresholds aligned with the problem constraints, these invariants provide insights into what triggers slow execution, helping to identify potential future slow scenarios.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
A substring of some string is called the most frequent, if the number of its occurrences is not less than number of occurrences of any other substring.

You are given a set of strings. A string (not necessarily from this set) is called good if all elements of the set are the most frequent substrings of this string. Restore the non-empty good string with minimum length. If several such strings exist, restore lexicographically minimum string. If there are no good strings, print "NO" (without quotes).

A substring of a string is a contiguous subsequence of letters in the string. For example, "ab", "c", "abc" are substrings of string "abc", while "ac" is not a substring of that string.

The number of occurrences of a substring in a string is the number of starting positions in the string where the substring occurs. These occurrences could overlap.

String a is lexicographically smaller than string b, if a is a prefix of b, or a has a smaller letter at the first position where a and b differ.

Input

The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of strings in the set.

Each of the next n lines contains a non-empty string consisting of lowercase English letters. It is guaranteed that the strings are distinct.

The total length of the strings doesn't exceed 105.

Output

Print the non-empty good string with minimum length. If several good strings exist, print lexicographically minimum among them. Print "NO" (without quotes) if there are no good strings.

Examples

Input

4
mail
ai
lru
cf


Output

cfmailru


Input

3
kek
preceq
cheburek


Output

NO

Note

One can show that in the first sample only two good strings with minimum length exist: "cfmailru" and "mailrucf". The first string is lexicographically minimum.

assistant: ### Phase 3: Implementing Natural Language Invariants in C++

Based on the performance-characterizing invariants derived in Phase 2, here are the C++ checker functions:

1. **Frequent Character Set Invariant:**

```cpp
void check_frequent_character_set_invariant(const vector<string>& strings) {
    int totalUniqueChars = 0;
    vector<bool> charPresence(26, false);
    
    for (const string& str : strings) {
        for (char c : str) {
            if (!charPresence[c - 'a']) {
                charPresence[c - 'a'] = true;
                totalUniqueChars++;
            }
        }
    }
    
    if (totalUniqueChars > 20) { // Arbitrary threshold, considering performance degradation with high diversity.
        cerr << "Warning: Frequent character set invariant triggered - excessive character diversity" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

2. **Inefficient Vector Manipulation Invariant:**

```cpp
void check_inefficient_vector_manipulation_invariant(const vector<string>& strings) {
    for (const string& str : strings) {
        if (str.size() > 50) { // Threshold for vector size manipulation contributing to bottlenecks
            cerr << "Warning: Inefficient vector manipulation invariant triggered - large string size" << endl;
            abort();
        }
    }
}
```

3. **Alphabet Coverage Invariant:**

```cpp
void check_alphabet_coverage_invariant(const vector<string>& strings) {
    vector<bool> alphabetCoverage(26, false);
    int distinctCharCount = 0;

    for (const string& str : strings) {
        for (char c : str) {
            if (!alphabetCoverage[c - 'a']) {
                alphabetCoverage[c - 'a'] = true;
                distinctCharCount++;
            }
        }
    }
    
    if (distinctCharCount > 23) { // Near total alphabet coverage, indicating high potential for slow path
        cerr << "Warning: Alphabet coverage invariant triggered - near full alphabet usage" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrating Checker Code

The following C++ code integrates the invariant checks into the original program. The checks are placed strategically to avoid unnecessary overhead in tight loops:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#pragma comment(linker, "/STACK:60777216")
using namespace std;

int n;
vector<string> s;

// Checker functions
void check_frequent_character_set_invariant(const vector<string>& strings) {
    int totalUniqueChars = 0;
    vector<bool> charPresence(26, false);
    
    for (const string& str : strings) {
        for (char c : str) {
            if (!charPresence[c - 'a']) {
                charPresence[c - 'a'] = true;
                totalUniqueChars++;
            }
        }
    }
    
    if (totalUniqueChars > 20) {
        cerr << "Warning: Frequent character set invariant triggered - excessive character diversity" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_inefficient_vector_manipulation_invariant(const vector<string>& strings) {
    for (const string& str : strings) {
        if (str.size() > 50) {
            cerr << "Warning: Inefficient vector manipulation invariant triggered - large string size" << endl;
            abort();
        }
    }
}

void check_alphabet_coverage_invariant(const vector<string>& strings) {
    vector<bool> alphabetCoverage(26, false);
    int distinctCharCount = 0;

    for (const string& str : strings) {
        for (char c : str) {
            if (!alphabetCoverage[c - 'a']) {
                alphabetCoverage[c - 'a'] = true;
                distinctCharCount++;
            }
        }
    }
    
    if (distinctCharCount > 23) {
        cerr << "Warning: Alphabet coverage invariant triggered - near full alphabet usage" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

string combine(vector<string> s, int t) {
    if (s.empty()) return "";
    vector<char> res(100, ' ');

    for (int i = 0; i < s.size(); i++) {
        int pos = 0;
        for (int j = 0; j < s[i].size(); j++)
            if (s[i][j] - 'a' == t) pos = j;

        for (int j = 0; j < s[i].size(); j++) {
            if (res[50 + j - pos] != ' ' && res[50 + j - pos] != s[i][j]) return "NO";
            res[50 + j - pos] = s[i][j];
        }
    }

    string w;
    for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++)
        if (res[i] != ' ') w.push_back(res[i]);

    int mask = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < w.size(); i++) {
        if (mask & (1 << (w[i] - 'a'))) return "NO";
        mask |= 1 << (w[i] - 'a');
    }

    return w;
}

int main() {
    cin >> n;
    string t;
    getline(cin, t);

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        getline(cin, t);
        int mask = 0;
        for (int j = 0; j < t.size(); j++) {
            if (mask & (1 << (t[j] - 'a'))) {
                puts("NO");
                return 0;
            }
            mask |= 1 << (t[j] - 'a');
        }
        s.push_back(t);
    }

    // Insert invariant checks after all input is read
    check_frequent_character_set_invariant(s);
    check_inefficient_vector_manipulation_invariant(s);
    check_alphabet_coverage_invariant(s);

    for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
        vector<string> ns, tmp;
        for (int j = 0; j < s.size(); j++) {
            bool has = 0;
            for (int k = 0; k < s[j].size(); k++)
                if (s[j][k] - 'a' == i) has = 1;
            if (has)
                tmp.push_back(s[j]);
            else
                ns.push_back(s[j]);
        }
        string t = combine(tmp, i);
        if (t == "NO") {
            puts("NO");
            return 0;
        }
        if (!t.empty()) ns.push_back(t);
        s = ns;
    }

    sort(s.begin(), s.end());
    for (int i = 0; i < s.size(); i++) cout << s[i];
    puts("");
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

- The checks are inserted after reading all input strings to avoid affecting performance inside loops.
- Each check verifies a different aspect of the performance concern:
  - `check_frequent_character_set_invariant` evaluates the diversity of characters across all strings.
  - `check_inefficient_vector_manipulation_invariant` ensures that no individual string contributes excessively to vector operations.
  - `check_alphabet_coverage_invariant` tracks the collective coverage of the alphabet by input strings.
