### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Comparison of Hit Counts:**
   - The line `for (long long i = 2; i <= sqrt(b); ++i) {` (line 45) shows **999,999** hits for the slow input compared to just **1** hit for the fast input.
   - The line `while (b % i == 0) {` (line 46) also shows a high hit count (**999,998** for the slow input) indicating that this inner loop is executed many times for the slow input, leading to a significantly slower runtime.
   - The loop `while (first <= n) {` (line 57) has **1 hit** for the slow input and **6 hits** for the fast input. Although the number of hits is low, this line is part of the critical loop that depends on the results from the previous computation.

2. **Interaction with Data Structures:**
   - The high number of hits for the `for` loop iterating up to `sqrt(b)` indicates that `b` is a large composite number with many small prime factors. This results in many divisions and increments in the map `pr`, which tracks the prime factorization of `b`.

3. **Loop and Calculation Observations:**
   - The inner `while` loop (line 46) is responsible for dividing `b` by its smallest prime factor `i` multiple times until `b` is no longer divisible by `i`. For a large `b` with many small prime factors, this loop executes many times, causing a slowdown.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **Invariant on Factorization Complexity:**
   - "If the base `b` has a large number of small prime factors, the time complexity of factorizing `b` increases, leading to slow performance. This is particularly evident when iterating up to `sqrt(b)` involves many repeated divisions."

   ```cpp
   void check_factorization_invariant(bool condition) {
       if (condition) {
           cerr << "Warning: factorization_invariant triggered - excessive factorization divisions" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }

   // Before starting factorization
   check_factorization_invariant(b > SOME_LARGE_THRESHOLD && /* condition indicating many small divisors */);
   ```

2. **Invariant on Prime Factor Divisions:**
   - "When the number `b` has a substantial number of small prime factors, many divisions are required to completely factorize the number, significantly impacting performance."

   ```cpp
   void check_division_invariant(bool condition) {
       if (condition) {
           cerr << "Warning: division_invariant triggered - many divisions required for factorization" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }

   // After computing prime factors
   check_division_invariant(pr.size() > SOME_FACTOR_COUNT_THRESHOLD);
   ```

3. **Invariant on Prime Factorization Loop:**
   - "If `b` requires iterating over a considerable range of integers to fully factorize, leading to a high number of loop iterations, it may cause slowdowns in computation."

   ```cpp
   void check_iteration_invariant(bool condition) {
       if (condition) {
           cerr << "Warning: iteration_invariant triggered - excessive loop iterations for factorization" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }

   // Before starting loop to factorize
   check_iteration_invariant(sqrt(b) > SOME_SQRT_B_THRESHOLD);
   ```

These invariants abstract the conditions under which the code becomes inefficient, focusing on the properties of `b` that lead to many iterations and divisions during factorization. The constants such as `SOME_LARGE_THRESHOLD`, `SOME_FACTOR_COUNT_THRESHOLD`, and `SOME_SQRT_B_THRESHOLD` can be defined based on experimentation to catch these slow conditions within the constraint boundaries of the problem.

### Phase 3: Implement the Natural Language Invariants in C++

To implement the performance invariants derived in Phase 2, we need to write checker functions in C++ that will be triggered when certain conditions indicative of potential slowdowns are met. Below are the C++ snippets for the invariants:

1. **Invariant on Factorization Complexity:**
   - This checks if `b` has many small prime factors, which leads to significant time spent in factorization.

   ```cpp
   void check_factorization_invariant(long long b, long long threshold) {
       long long count = 0;
       for (long long i = 2; i <= sqrt(b); ++i) {
           while (b % i == 0) {
               count++;
               b /= i;
           }
       }
       if (b > 1) count++; // Count the last prime factor if b is still greater than 1
       
       if (count > threshold) {
           cerr << "Warning: factorization_invariant triggered - excessive factorization divisions" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Invariant on Prime Factor Divisions:**
   - This checks if there are excessive divisions needed to factorize `b`.

   ```cpp
   void check_division_invariant(const map<long long, long long>& pr, long long threshold) {
       if (pr.size() > threshold) {
           cerr << "Warning: division_invariant triggered - many divisions required for factorization" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Invariant on Prime Factorization Loop:**
   - This checks if the loop for factorizing `b` involves iterating over too large a range.

   ```cpp
   void check_iteration_invariant(long long b, long long threshold) {
       if (sqrt(b) > threshold) {
           cerr << "Warning: iteration_invariant triggered - excessive loop iterations for factorization" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Integrate the Checkers into the Original Program

Now we integrate these checks into the C++ solution provided:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Checker functions
void check_factorization_invariant(long long b, long long threshold) {
    long long count = 0;
    for (long long i = 2; i <= sqrt(b); ++i) {
        while (b % i == 0) {
            count++;
            b /= i;
        }
    }
    if (b > 1) count++; // Count the last prime factor if b is still greater than 1
    
    if (count > threshold) {
        cerr << "Warning: factorization_invariant triggered - excessive factorization divisions" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_division_invariant(const map<long long, long long>& pr, long long threshold) {
    if (pr.size() > threshold) {
        cerr << "Warning: division_invariant triggered - many divisions required for factorization" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_iteration_invariant(long long b, long long threshold) {
    if (sqrt(b) > threshold) {
        cerr << "Warning: iteration_invariant triggered - excessive loop iterations for factorization" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    ios::sync_with_stdio(0);
    cin.tie(0);
    cout.tie(0);
    cout << setprecision(10);

    long long n, b;
    cin >> n >> b;
    
    // Insert invariant checks
    long long factorization_threshold = 1000; // Sample threshold
    long long iteration_threshold = 1000000; // Sample threshold
    check_iteration_invariant(b, iteration_threshold);
    
    map<long long, long long> pr;
    long long b_copy = b;
    
    for (long long i = 2; i <= sqrt(b_copy); ++i) {
        while (b_copy % i == 0) {
            pr[i]++;
            b_copy /= i;
        }
    }
    if (b_copy > 1) pr[b_copy]++;
    
    // Check factorization complexity
    check_factorization_invariant(b, factorization_threshold);
    check_division_invariant(pr, factorization_threshold);

    long long mi = -1;
    for (auto el : pr) {
        if (el.second == 0) continue;
        long long first = el.first;
        long long c = 0;
        while (first <= n) {
            c += n / first;
            if (first > n / el.first) break;
            first *= el.first;
        }
        c /= el.second;
        if (mi == -1) mi = c;
        mi = min(mi, c);
    }
    cout << mi << '\n';
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

- **Checker Placement:** The checks are placed before the loops start, using reasonable thresholds that can be adjusted based on further profiling or empirical data. This ensures that they do not add overhead in the tight loops.
- **Adjustable Thresholds:** The thresholds (e.g., `factorization_threshold`, `iteration_threshold`) are placeholders and can be tuned for the specific performance characteristics of the hardware or input patterns observed in practice.
- **Integration:** The checks are seamlessly integrated to ensure that the conditions leading to potential slowdowns are caught early, providing useful feedback for performance tuning.
