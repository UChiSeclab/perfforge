system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

The number "zero" is called "love" (or "l'oeuf" to be precise, literally means "egg" in French), for example when denoting the zero score in a game of tennis. 

Aki is fond of numbers, especially those with trailing zeros. For example, the number 9200 has two trailing zeros. Aki thinks the more trailing zero digits a number has, the prettier it is.

However, Aki believes, that the number of trailing zeros of a number is not static, but depends on the base (radix) it is represented in. Thus, he considers a few scenarios with some numbers and bases. And now, since the numbers he used become quite bizarre, he asks you to help him to calculate the beauty of these numbers.

Given two integers n and b (in decimal notation), your task is to calculate the number of trailing zero digits in the b-ary (in the base/radix of b) representation of n ! ([factorial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial) of n). 

Input

The only line of the input contains two integers n and b (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^{18}, 2 ≤ b ≤ 10^{12}).

Output

Print an only integer — the number of trailing zero digits in the b-ary representation of n!

Note

In the first example, 6!_{(10)} = 720_{(10)} = 880_{(9)}.

In the third and fourth example, 5!_{(10)} = 120_{(10)} = 1111000_{(2)}.

The representation of the number x in the b-ary base is d_1, d_2, …, d_k if x = d_1 b^{k - 1} + d_2 b^{k - 2} + … + d_k b^0, where d_i are integers and 0 ≤ d_i ≤ b - 1. For example, the number 720 from the first example is represented as 880_{(9)} since 720 = 8 ⋅ 9^2 + 8 ⋅ 9 + 0 ⋅ 1.

You can read more about bases [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix).

assistant: To diagnose the performance bottleneck and create performance-characterizing invariants, we first need to analyze the provided C code and the hit count data to understand where and why the slow input case is taking significantly longer. Here's a breakdown of the two phases involved:

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Hit Count Analysis**:
    - **Line 12** (`for (i = 2; i * i <= base; i++)`): This line is executed over 1.1 million times for the slow input, compared to just 5 times for the fast input. This suggests that the loop is iterating over a large range of values.
    - **Lines 13-29**: These lines are also executed a significant number of times in the slow input but only a few times in the fast input.
    - **Line 21** (`while (k / i > 0)`) and subsequent lines inside this loop: These are executed multiple times, but notably, line 21 is hit 7 times in the slow input compared to 14 times in the fast input.

2. **Reason for Excessive Iteration**:
    - The loop on line 12 is iterating over all numbers up to the square root of `base`. When `base` is very large, as in the slow input, the number of iterations increases drastically.
    - The operations within the loop (primarily factorization logic with division and modulus) are computationally expensive and executed many times due to the large base size.

3. **Interaction with Inputs**:
    - The primary factor here is the size of the `base`. A larger base means more iterations of the outer loop, and more divisor checks and calculations in the nested loops.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the above observations, we can conclude on some performance-characterizing invariants:

1. **Invariant 1: Large Base Size**:
   - **Description**: "If the base `b` is large, particularly if its value is close to its upper constraint (b ≤ 10^{12}), the program may execute a significantly higher number of iterations due to the loop checking all divisors up to the square root of the base. This can cause performance degradation."
   - **Reasoning**: This captures the core reason why the loop and associated calculations become expensive.

2. **Invariant 2: Prime Factorization Overhead**:
   - **Description**: "When the base `b` has a large number of small prime factors, the nested loops and conditional checks for factorization will be triggered frequently, increasing the computation time."
   - **Reasoning**: The complexity increases as factorization involves multiple division and modulus operations, which are costly when repeated many times.

3. **Invariant 3: High Iteration Count in Nested Loops**:
   - **Description**: "If the number `n` and the prime factors of `b` result in many iterations of the nested loop (inside the divisor computation for trailing zeros), performance can degrade. This typically happens when `n` is large relative to the factors of `b`."
   - **Reasoning**: The interaction between `n` and the base's factors determines how many times the inner loop executes, affecting performance.

These invariants abstract the problematic conditions without reliance on specific input values but rather focus on the structural causes of performance issues. They help identify scenarios that could lead to similar performance issues in other inputs adhering to the constraints.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
The number "zero" is called "love" (or "l'oeuf" to be precise, literally means "egg" in French), for example when denoting the zero score in a game of tennis. 

Aki is fond of numbers, especially those with trailing zeros. For example, the number 9200 has two trailing zeros. Aki thinks the more trailing zero digits a number has, the prettier it is.

However, Aki believes, that the number of trailing zeros of a number is not static, but depends on the base (radix) it is represented in. Thus, he considers a few scenarios with some numbers and bases. And now, since the numbers he used become quite bizarre, he asks you to help him to calculate the beauty of these numbers.

Given two integers n and b (in decimal notation), your task is to calculate the number of trailing zero digits in the b-ary (in the base/radix of b) representation of n ! ([factorial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial) of n). 

Input

The only line of the input contains two integers n and b (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^{18}, 2 ≤ b ≤ 10^{12}).

Output

Print an only integer — the number of trailing zero digits in the b-ary representation of n!

Examples

3


Input

5 10


Output

1

Note

In the first example, 6!_{(10)} = 720_{(10)} = 880_{(9)}.

In the third and fourth example, 5!_{(10)} = 120_{(10)} = 1111000_{(2)}.

The representation of the number x in the b-ary base is d_1, d_2, …, d_k if x = d_1 b^{k - 1} + d_2 b^{k - 2} + … + d_k b^0, where d_i are integers and 0 ≤ d_i ≤ b - 1. For example, the number 720 from the first example is represented as 880_{(9)} since 720 = 8 ⋅ 9^2 + 8 ⋅ 9 + 0 ⋅ 1.

assistant: ### Phase 3: Implementing Checker Code for Performance Invariants in C++

Let's translate the identified invariants into C++ checker code:

#### Invariant 1: Large Base Size

```cpp
void check_large_base(long long b) {
    if (b > 1e12 / 1000) {  // Adjusted threshold for practical checking
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to large base size!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

#### Invariant 2: Prime Factorization Overhead

```cpp
void check_prime_factorization_overhead(long long b) {
    long long count = 0;
    for (long long i = 2; i * i <= b; ++i) {
        while (b % i == 0) {
            b /= i;
            ++count;
        }
    }
    if (b > 1) ++count;  // For the remaining prime factor if b is prime
    if (count > 20) {  // Arbitrary threshold for number of prime factors
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to prime factorization overhead!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

#### Invariant 3: High Iteration Count in Nested Loops

```cpp
void check_high_iteration_count(long long n, long long b) {
    // Estimation of high iteration overhead
    if (n > 1e6 && b > 1e6) {  // Example threshold for both parameters
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to high iteration count in loops!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrating Checker Code into the Original Program

Now, let's integrate these checks into the original C++ code. We will place the checks effectively after reading the input and before the main computational loop to avoid overhead in tight loops.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Checker for large base size
void check_large_base(long long b) {
    if (b > 1e12 / 1000) {  // Adjusted threshold for practical checking
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to large base size!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Checker for prime factorization overhead
void check_prime_factorization_overhead(long long b) {
    long long count = 0;
    for (long long i = 2; i * i <= b; ++i) {
        while (b % i == 0) {
            b /= i;
            ++count;
        }
    }
    if (b > 1) ++count;  // For the remaining prime factor if b is prime
    if (count > 20) {  // Arbitrary threshold for number of prime factors
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to prime factorization overhead!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Checker for high iteration count in nested loops
void check_high_iteration_count(long long n, long long b) {
    if (n > 1e6 && b > 1e6) {  // Example threshold for both parameters
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to high iteration count in loops!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

signed main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);
    cout.tie(NULL);
    
    long long n, base;
    cin >> n >> base;

    // Performance checkers
    check_large_base(base);  // Check for large base size
    check_prime_factorization_overhead(base);  // Check for prime factorization overhead
    check_high_iteration_count(n, base);  // Check for high iteration count in loops

    long long noz = n;
    long long j = base;
    for (long long i = 2; i * i <= base; i++) {
        if (j % i == 0) {
            long long p = 0;
            while (j % i == 0) {
                p++;
                j /= i;
            }
            long long c = 0;
            long long k = n;
            while (k / i > 0) {
                c += k / i;
                k /= i;
            }
            noz = min(noz, c / p);
        }
    }
    if (j > 1) {
        long long p = 0;
        while (j % j == 0) {
            p++;
            j /= j;
        }
        long long c = 0;
        long long k = n;
        while (k / j > 0) {
            c += k / j;
            k /= j;
        }
        noz = min(noz, c / p);
    }
    cout << noz;
    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation**:
- The checkers for each invariant are placed immediately after reading the inputs to ensure that any problematic conditions are caught early.
- The threshold values in the checkers are selected to detect performance bottlenecks realistically, based on the constraints of the problem.
- Each checker outputs a warning and aborts the program if a bottleneck condition is detected.
