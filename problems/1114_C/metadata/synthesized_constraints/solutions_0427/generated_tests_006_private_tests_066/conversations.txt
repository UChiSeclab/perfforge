system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

The number "zero" is called "love" (or "l'oeuf" to be precise, literally means "egg" in French), for example when denoting the zero score in a game of tennis. 

Aki is fond of numbers, especially those with trailing zeros. For example, the number 9200 has two trailing zeros. Aki thinks the more trailing zero digits a number has, the prettier it is.

However, Aki believes, that the number of trailing zeros of a number is not static, but depends on the base (radix) it is represented in. Thus, he considers a few scenarios with some numbers and bases. And now, since the numbers he used become quite bizarre, he asks you to help him to calculate the beauty of these numbers.

Given two integers n and b (in decimal notation), your task is to calculate the number of trailing zero digits in the b-ary (in the base/radix of b) representation of n ! ([factorial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial) of n). 

Input

The only line of the input contains two integers n and b (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^{18}, 2 ≤ b ≤ 10^{12}).

Output

Print an only integer — the number of trailing zero digits in the b-ary representation of n!

Note

In the first example, 6!_{(10)} = 720_{(10)} = 880_{(9)}.

In the third and fourth example, 5!_{(10)} = 120_{(10)} = 1111000_{(2)}.

The representation of the number x in the b-ary base is d_1, d_2, …, d_k if x = d_1 b^{k - 1} + d_2 b^{k - 2} + … + d_k b^0, where d_i are integers and 0 ≤ d_i ≤ b - 1. For example, the number 720 from the first example is represented as 880_{(9)} since 720 = 8 ⋅ 9^2 + 8 ⋅ 9 + 0 ⋅ 1.

You can read more about bases [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix).

assistant: ### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Compare Line-Level Hit Counts**:
   - **Line 12**: The loop `for (long long i = 2; i <= sqrt(c); i++)` has a dramatically higher hit count for the slow input (1,000,000) compared to the fast input (9).
   - **Line 13**: Similarly, this line within the loop is hit frequently for the slow input (999,999) but much less for the fast input (8).
   - **Line 14**: The inner loop for marking multiples `for (long long j = 2; j * i < MX; j++) mark[i * j] = 1;` has excessive hits for the slow input (1,063,442) compared to the fast input (0).
   - **Line 18**: The while loop `while (a) sum += a / i, a = a / i;` also gets hit more for the slow input (169 times) compared to the fast input (0).

2. **Pinpoint Lines or Functions with More Hits**:
   - The main inefficiency stems from the nested loops (lines 12-14) which are involved in factorizing the base `b` and marking multiples.
   - The while loop (line 18) contributes as it calculates the number of times the factor divides `n!`, but this is called far fewer times.

3. **Data Structures and Input Constraints**:
   - The `mark` array is used to track prime factors up to a constant maximum value (MX), which is inefficient for large values of `b` with many prime factors.
   - The difference in hit counts indicates the slow input likely has a `b` with more small factors or a larger range of factors, leading to more iterations and operations.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **Natural Language Performance Invariants**:

   - **Invariant 1**: "If the base `b` has a large number of small prime factors, resulting in many iterations in the factorization loop, the computation of trailing zeros may become significantly slower."
   
   - **Invariant 2**: "When the base `b` is such that its prime factorization requires checking a wide range of potential factors (up to the square root of `b`), the performance is likely to degrade due to increased loop iterations."

   - **Invariant 3**: "If the base `b` is composed of multiple prime factors that require marking a large number of multiples within the allowed range, the overhead in marking can lead to slower execution."

2. **Threshold Values**:
   - These invariants are not directly tied to the maximum constraints of `n <= 10^{18}` and `b <= 10^{12}` but are instead focused on the factorization behavior and the breadth of factors up to `sqrt(b)`.
   - The complexity is influenced by `b` having smaller prime factors or a large number of them within its factorization, which impacts the number of loop iterations significantly.

3. **Conditions Correlated to Input Patterns**:
   - These conditions focus on the nature of the base `b` and its factorization properties, which indirectly influence the performance due to the program's reliance on these calculations to determine trailing zeros.

By understanding these performance invariants, one can anticipate potential slowdowns based on the composition of the base `b` without needing to resort to specific inputs, thus providing a broad yet accurate picture of performance triggers.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
The number "zero" is called "love" (or "l'oeuf" to be precise, literally means "egg" in French), for example when denoting the zero score in a game of tennis. 

Aki is fond of numbers, especially those with trailing zeros. For example, the number 9200 has two trailing zeros. Aki thinks the more trailing zero digits a number has, the prettier it is.

Thus, he considers a few scenarios with some numbers and bases. And now, since the numbers he used become quite bizarre, he asks you to help him to calculate the beauty of these numbers.

Given two integers n and b (in decimal notation), your task is to calculate the number of trailing zero digits in the b-ary (in the base/radix of b) representation of n ! ([factorial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial) of n). 

Input

The only line of the input contains two integers n and b (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^{18}, 2 ≤ b ≤ 10^{12}).

In the third and fourth example, 5!_{(10)} = 120_{(10)} = 1111000_{(2)}.

The representation of the number x in the b-ary base is d_1, d_2, …, d_k if x = d_1 b^{k - 1} + d_2 b^{k - 2} + … + d_k b^0, where d_i are integers and 0 ≤ d_i ≤ b - 1. For example, the number 720 from the first example is represented as 880_{(9)} since 720 = 8 ⋅ 9^2 + 8 ⋅ 9 + 0 ⋅ 1.

assistant: ### Phase 3: Implement the Natural Language Invariants as C++ Checkers

Below are C++ code snippets implementing the performance-characterizing invariants:

```cpp
// Check for large number of small prime factors
void check_factorization_invariant(long long b, long long threshold) {
    long long factorCount = 0;
    long long c = b;
    for (long long i = 2; i <= sqrt(c); i++) {
        if (c % i == 0) {
            while (c % i == 0) {
                c /= i;
                factorCount++;
            }
        }
    }
    if (c > 1) factorCount++;  // account for c being a prime factor itself

    if (factorCount > threshold) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to many small prime factors!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Check for broad factorization range
void check_broad_factorization_range(long long b, long long rangeThreshold) {
    if (b > rangeThreshold) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to broad factorization range!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Check for excessive marking in sieve
void check_excessive_marking(long long b, long long markThreshold) {
    long long c = b;
    long long markCount = 0;
    vector<bool> mark(MX, false);
    for (long long i = 2; i <= sqrt(c); i++) {
        if (c % i == 0) {
            for (long long j = 2; j * i < MX; j++) {
                if (!mark[i * j]) {
                    mark[i * j] = true;
                    markCount++;
                }
            }
        }
    }

    if (markCount > markThreshold) {
        cerr << "Warning: Excessive marking during factorization!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrate Checkers into the Original Program

Below is the instrumented C++ code with the integrated checker functions:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
const long long MX = 1e6 + 100;
long long n, b, mn = 1e18 + 1000;
bool mark[MX];

// Check for large number of small prime factors
void check_factorization_invariant(long long b, long long threshold) {
    long long factorCount = 0;
    long long c = b;
    for (long long i = 2; i <= sqrt(c); i++) {
        if (c % i == 0) {
            while (c % i == 0) {
                c /= i;
                factorCount++;
            }
        }
    }

### Explanation of the Checkers:

- **Check for Small Prime Factors**: This checks if `b` has an excessive number of small prime factors which may lead to increased computation time.
  
- **Check for Broad Factorization Range**: This check ensures that the factorization range doesn't exceed a threshold, which could lead to inefficiencies.
  
- **Check for Excessive Marking**: This checks the number of operations in the marking sieve logic to prevent excessive operations, which could lead to performance issues. 

Each checker is designed to abort the program if a potential performance bottleneck condition is detected, which helps in identifying and testing performance issues.
