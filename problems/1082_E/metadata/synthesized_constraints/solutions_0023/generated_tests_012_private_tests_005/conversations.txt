system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

You are given array a of length n. You can choose one segment [l, r] (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) and integer value k (positive, negative or even zero) and change a_l, a_{l + 1}, ..., a_r by k each (i.e. a_i := a_i + k for each l ≤ i ≤ r).

What is the maximum possible number of elements with value c that can be obtained after one such operation?

Input

The first line contains two integers n and c (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^5, 1 ≤ c ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^5) — the length of array and the value c to obtain.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^5) — array a.

Output

Print one integer — the maximum possible number of elements with value c which can be obtained after performing operation described above.

Note

In the first example we can choose any segment and k = 0. The array will stay same.

In the second example we can choose segment [1, 3] and k = -4. The array will become [2, -2, 2].

assistant: ## Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

### Analysis of Hit Counts:

1. **Line 22: `for (int i = 0; i < 500003 && ans < n; i++)`**
   - **Slow Input Hits**: 500004 times
   - **Fast Input Hits**: 3 times
   - **Observation**: This loop iterates over a large range, indicating that for the slow input, the loop does not break early and continues through most of its potential iterations. This suggests the loop body is being executed more often than necessary.

2. **Line 23: `if (S[i] > 0)`**
   - **Slow Input Hits**: 500003 times
   - **Fast Input Hits**: 2 times
   - **Observation**: The condition is checked very frequently, implying that a significant portion of the array `S` is being traversed for the slow input.

3. **Line 25: `sort(P[i].begin(), P[i].end());`**
   - **Slow Input Hits**: 5 times
   - **Fast Input Hits**: 1 time
   - **Observation**: Sorting operations are costly, especially if done repeatedly within a loop. This line is a potential hotspot if `P[i]` contains many elements.

4. **Lines 27-29: Nested loop processing `P[i]`**
   - **Slow Input Hits**: Line 27 is hit 44 times, and lines 28 and 29 are hit 39 times each compared to only 1 time for the fast input.
   - **Observation**: The inner loop processes the list `P[i]`, and it seems to be hit significantly more for the slow input, indicating that `P[i]` has more elements to process or is being processed inefficiently.

### Summary:
The primary slowdown appears to stem from the large number of iterations in the outer loop on line 22, combined with potentially inefficient processing within the nested loop on lines 27-29, especially related to sorting or traversing large data sets.

## Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

### Invariant 1: Condition involving large segment list `P[i]`
- **Natural Language Invariant**: "If the list `P[i]` for any `i` contains a large number of indices and must be sorted or processed in a nested loop, the program may experience a slowdown."
- **Rationale**: The processing of large lists with sorting operations inside loops leads to increased computational overhead.

### Invariant 2: Condition involving extensive outer loop iterations
- **Natural Language Invariant**: "If a significant portion of the iteration space in the outer loop is needed to find potential maximum values, performance can degrade as the loop runs nearly to its maximum extent."
- **Rationale**: When the outer loop condition `ans < n` isn't met early, results in unnecessary iterations that contribute to the slowdown.

### Invariant 3: Condition related to frequency of operations
- **Natural Language Invariant**: "Frequent updates and checks on data structures like `S` and `C` across large input ranges can lead to performance bottlenecks if they occur in every loop iteration."
- **Rationale**: Constant operations over large arrays or data structures due to high-frequency checks significantly impact execution time.

These invariants aim to diagnose conditions under which the algorithm's performance degrades, and they suggest that attention to data structure sizes, sorting operations, and loop iteration limits are crucial in potential slow scenarios.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp

    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
You are given array a of length n. You can choose one segment [l, r] (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) and integer value k (positive, negative or even zero) and change a_l, a_{l + 1}, ..., a_r by k each (i.e. a_i := a_i + k for each l ≤ i ≤ r).

What is the maximum possible number of elements with value c that can be obtained after one such operation?

Input

The first line contains two integers n and c (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^5, 1 ≤ c ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^5) — the length of array and the value c to obtain.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^5) — array a.

Output

Print one integer — the maximum possible number of elements with value c which can be obtained after performing operation described above.

Examples

Input


6 9
9 9 9 9 9 9


Output


6


Input


3 2
6 2 6


Output

Note

In the first example we can choose any segment and k = 0. The array will stay same.

In the second example we can choose segment [1, 3] and k = -4. The array will become [2, -2, 2].

### Invariant 1: Large Segment List `P[i]`
```cpp
void check_large_list_invariant(int listSize) {
    if (listSize > 10000) {  // Threshold set based on the potential slowdown due to sorting
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large list size for sorting!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Invariant 2: Extensive Outer Loop Iterations
```cpp
void check_outer_loop_invariant(int loopIterations, int n) {
    if (loopIterations > n / 2) {  // Assuming a significant portion if it exceeds half of `n`
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive outer loop iterations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Invariant 3: Frequent Operations
```cpp
void check_frequent_operations_invariant(int operationCount, int threshold) {
    if (operationCount > threshold) {  // Hypothetical threshold based on experiments or domain knowledge
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - frequent operations on data structures!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

## Phase 4: Integrating Checker Code into the Original Program

Now, let's incorporate these checks into the original C++ solution, ensuring they are placed effectively without introducing significant overhead:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Checkers for performance bottlenecks
void check_large_list_invariant(int listSize) {
    if (listSize > 10000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large list size for sorting!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_outer_loop_invariant(int loopIterations, int n) {
    if (loopIterations > n / 2) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive outer loop iterations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_frequent_operations_invariant(int operationCount, int threshold) {
    if (operationCount > threshold) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - frequent operations on data structures!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

template <typename T>
void __exit(T message);

template <typename T>
ostream &operator<<(ostream &out, const vector<T> &V);

template <class T1, class T2>
ostream &operator<<(ostream &out, const pair<T1, T2> &P);

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false), cin.tie(0), cout.tie(0);
    int n, c, ans = 0;
    cin >> n >> c;
    vector<int> A(n + 1), S(500003, 0), C(n + 1, 0);
    vector<vector<int> > P(500003);

    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        cin >> A[i];
        S[A[i]]++;
        P[A[i]].push_back(i);
        C[i] = C[i - 1] + (A[i] == c);
    }
    ans = C[n];

    int outerLoopIterations = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < 500003 && ans < n; i++) {
        outerLoopIterations++;
        if (S[i] > 0) {
            ans = max(ans, max(C[n] + 1, S[i]));
            sort(P[i].begin(), P[i].end());

            // Check for large list size before sorting
            check_large_list_invariant(P[i].size());

            int cur = 0, mini = 0;
            for (int j = 0; j < P[i].size(); j++) {
                if (P[i][j] != 0) mini = min(mini, j - C[P[i][j] - 1]);
                cur = max(cur, j + 1 - C[P[i][j]] - mini);
            }
            ans = max(ans, C[n] + cur);
        }
    }

    // Check for excessive outer loop iterations
    check_outer_loop_invariant(outerLoopIterations, n);

    // Hypothetical frequent operations check (if applicable)
    // check_frequent_operations_invariant(someCount, someThreshold);

    cout << ans << endl;
    return 0;
}

template <typename T>
ostream &operator<<(ostream &out, const vector<T> &V) {
    if (!V.empty()) {
        out << "{";
        for (auto v : V) out << v << ", ";
        out << "\b\b}";
    } else {
        out << "{}";
    }
    return out;
}

template <typename T>
void __exit(T message) {
    cout << message << endl;
    exit(0);
}

template <class T1, class T2>
ostream &operator<<(ostream &out, const pair<T1, T2> &P) {
    out << "(" << P.first << ", " << P.second << ")";
    return out;
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Invariant 1**: A check is added before sorting in the loop to ensure the list size `P[i]` is not too large.
- **Invariant 2**: A counter `outerLoopIterations` is used to track the number of iterations in the outer loop, checked after completion.
- **Invariant 3**: Though hypothetical, the setup is there to implement similar checks related to operation frequency if necessary.
