system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

You are given array a of length n. You can choose one segment [l, r] (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) and integer value k (positive, negative or even zero) and change a_l, a_{l + 1}, ..., a_r by k each (i.e. a_i := a_i + k for each l ≤ i ≤ r).

What is the maximum possible number of elements with value c that can be obtained after one such operation?

Input

The first line contains two integers n and c (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^5, 1 ≤ c ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^5) — the length of array and the value c to obtain.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^5) — array a.

Output

Print one integer — the maximum possible number of elements with value c which can be obtained after performing operation described above.

Examples

Input


6 9
9 9 9 9 9 9


Output


6


Input


3 2
6 2 6


Output

Note

In the first example we can choose any segment and k = 0. The array will stay same.

In the second example we can choose segment [1, 3] and k = -4. The array will become [2, -2, 2].

assistant: ## Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

### Analysis of Hit Counts
1. **Line 50:** The for loop `for (int i = 1; i <= mx; ++i)` in the `calc()` function gets significantly more hits in the slow input with a hit count of 500001 compared to 3 in the fast input.
2. **Line 51:** The conditional `if (!pos[i].size() || i == k) continue;` is also hit 500,000 times in the slow input versus 2 times in the fast input.
   
### Observations
- The loop from line 50 iterates over all possible values up to `mx`, which is the maximum element in the input array. In the slow input, `mx` equals `500000`, resulting in a vast number of iterations.
- The conditional check on line 51 is likely causing iterations to skip most of the loop body consistently in the slow input, as evidenced by the lack of hits on subsequent lines (52-56).

## Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

### Performance Invariants in Natural Language
1. **High Maximum Element Value:**
   - **Invariant:** "If the maximum element value in the array (`mx`) is large, the program may iterate excessively over possible values, slowing down computation."
   - **Rationale:** The `calc()` function's loop iterates over all integers up to `mx`. A higher `mx` significantly increases iterations, causing potential slowdowns even if they are mostly skipped by conditionals.

2. **Sparse Population in `pos` Array:**
   - **Invariant:** "If most elements of the array `pos` are sparse or empty, combined with a large `mx`, the program may spend time repeatedly checking empty conditions."
   - **Rationale:** The conditional check on line 51 depends on the size of `pos[i]`. If `pos` is sparsely populated, especially for large `mx`, the loop spends a lot of time checking conditions that result in skipping the loop body.

3. **Excessively Large Input Values:**
   - **Invariant:** "When the array contains maximum possible integer values, the range of values to check increases, leading to a potential increase in computation time."
   - **Rationale:** With arrays having large values, `mx` becomes large, increasing the iterations of the outer loop in the `calc()` function, contributing to slowdowns.

These invariants highlight potential performance bottlenecks linked to the input values' characteristics rather than just their size, showing how the distribution and magnitude of input data affect program execution time.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
You are given array a of length n. You can choose one segment [l, r] (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) and integer value k (positive, negative or even zero) and change a_l, a_{l + 1}, ..., a_r by k each (i.e. a_i := a_i + k for each l ≤ i ≤ r).

What is the maximum possible number of elements with value c that can be obtained after one such operation?

Input

The first line contains two integers n and c (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^5, 1 ≤ c ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^5) — the length of array and the value c to obtain.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^5) — array a.

Output

Print one integer — the maximum possible number of elements with value c which can be obtained after performing operation described above.

Examples

Input


6 9
9 9 9 9 9 9


Output


6


Input


3 2
6 2 6


Output


2

Note

In the first example we can choose any segment and k = 0. The array will stay same.

In the second example we can choose segment [1, 3] and k = -4. The array will become [2, -2, 2].

Solution (C++ code):
{solution}


assistant: ## Phase 3: Implement the Natural Language Invariants in C++

Let's translate the performance-characterizing invariants into runtime checks in C++:

### Invariant 1: High Maximum Element Value
```cpp
void check_max_element_invariant(int mx) {
    if (mx > 100000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered! High maximum element value." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Invariant 2: Sparse Population in `pos` Array
```cpp
void check_sparse_population_invariant(const vector<int>& pos, int mx) {
    int sparse_count = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= mx; ++i) {
        if (pos[i].empty()) {
            ++sparse_count;
        }
    }
    if (sparse_count > mx / 2) { // arbitrary threshold for sparsity
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered! Sparse population in pos array." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Invariant 3: Excessively Large Input Values
```cpp
void check_large_input_values_invariant(const vector<int>& a) {
    for (int x : a) {
        if (x >= 500000) {
            cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered! Excessively large input value." << endl;
            abort();
        }
    }
}
```

## Phase 4: Integrate Checks into the Original C++ Program

Now, let's integrate these checks into the original C++ program at appropriate locations:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#pragma GCC optimize(3, "Ofast", "inline")
using namespace std;

// Function to check high maximum element value
void check_max_element_invariant(int mx) {
    if (mx > 100000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered! High maximum element value." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Function to check sparse population in pos array
void check_sparse_population_invariant(const vector<int> pos[], int mx) {
    int sparse_count = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= mx; ++i) {
        if (pos[i].empty()) {
            ++sparse_count;
        }
    }
    if (sparse_count > mx / 2) { // arbitrary threshold for sparsity
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered! Sparse population in pos array." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Function to check excessively large input values
void check_large_input_values_invariant(const vector<int>& a) {
    for (int x : a) {
        if (x >= 500000) {
            cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered! Excessively large input value." << endl;
            abort();
        }
    }
}

bool Finish_read;
template <class T>
inline void read(T &x) {
    Finish_read = 0;
    x = 0;
    int f = 1;
    char ch = getchar();
    while (!isdigit(ch)) {
        if (ch == '-') f = -1;
        if (ch == EOF) return;
        ch = getchar();
    }
    while (isdigit(ch)) x = x * 10 + ch - '0', ch = getchar();
    x *= f;
    Finish_read = 1;
}
template <class T>
inline void print(T x) {
    if (x / 10 != 0) print(x / 10);
    putchar(x % 10 + '0');
}
template <class T>
inline void writeln(T x) {
    if (x < 0) putchar('-');
    x = abs(x);
    print(x);
    putchar('\n');
}

const int maxn = 500005;
int n, k, mx;
vector<int> pos[maxn];
inline int id(int x) {
    return lower_bound(pos[k].begin(), pos[k].end(), x) - pos[k].begin();
}
inline void init() {
    read(n), read(k);
    vector<int> a(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        read(a[i]);
        pos[a[i]].push_back(i + 1);
        mx = max(mx, a[i]);
    }
    // Check for performance bottlenecks
    check_max_element_invariant(mx);
    check_sparse_population_invariant(pos, mx);
    check_large_input_values_invariant(a);
}
inline int calc() {
    int now = pos[k].size(), cnt = now;
    for (int i = 1; i <= mx; ++i) {
        if (!pos[i].size() || i == k) continue;
        int p = 1;
        now = max(now, cnt + p);
        for (int j = 1; j < (int)pos[i].size(); ++j)
            now = max(now,
                      cnt + (p = max(p + 1 - id(pos[i][j]) + id(pos[i][j - 1]), 1)));
    }
    return now;
}
int main() {
    init();
    writeln(calc());
}
```

### Explanation of Inserted Checks
1. **`check_max_element_invariant`:** This check is called after determining `mx` in `init()`. It ensures that `mx` is not excessively large, preventing unnecessary iterations in the loop.
2. **`check_sparse_population_invariant`:** This check runs after populating the `pos` array, identifying scenarios where many entries are empty.
3. **`check_large_input_values_invariant`:** This check verifies that none of the input values are excessively large immediately after reading the array `a`.

These checks help identify and warn about potential performance bottlenecks based on the identified invariants.
