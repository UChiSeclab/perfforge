=== Invariants Response ===
Based on the provided information, let's analyze the code to identify potential performance bottlenecks and derive performance-characterizing invariants.

### Phase 1: Analyze the Code

1. **Compare Line-Level Hit Counts:**
   - Lines with significant difference in hit counts between slow and fast runs are indicators of potential bottlenecks.
   - The loops with high hit counts, particularly lines 55-69 and 72-89, show a large disparity in execution frequency between the slow and fast inputs.

2. **Identify Expensive Code Segments:**
   - **Outer Loop (Line 55)**: Iterates over `mask` from `0` to `(1ll << 30)`. This loop runs a very high number of times for the slow input due to the small base `w = 3`.
   - **Nested Loop (Line 58)**: Runs for each bit in `mask`, iterating up to 30 times. This inner loop contributes significantly to the workload.
   - **Outer Loop (Line 72)**: Another expensive loop with similar range as the first loop, iterating over `y`.
   - **Nested Loop (Line 75)**: Similar nested loop contributing to workload.

3. **Inference on Code Interaction:**
   - The loops are exploring combinations of powers of `w` to form sums that balance the scales.
   - The performance bottleneck arises because for small `w`, there are many combinations to check, resulting in high computational cost.

### Phase 2: Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the analysis, here are the conditions under which the program runs slowly, described in natural language:

1. **Invariant 1: Small Base Exponentiation**
   - When the base `w` is small, the number of combinations of powers of `w` to explore increases exponentially. This results in repeated evaluations of possible sums, leading to significant computational overhead.
   - **Natural Language Description**: "If `w` is small, such as close to its minimum value of 2, the program explores a large number of power combinations, which increases computational complexity."

2. **Invariant 2: Large Search Space**
   - The nested loops involve computing powers of `w` up to 30 times, resulting in a large search space when `m` is large.
   - **Natural Language Description**: "If `m` is large and `w` is small, the search space expands greatly due to the need to evaluate many combinations of powers of `w`, causing the program to slow down."

3. **Invariant 3: High Iteration Count**
   - The loops iterate over a large range `(1ll << 30)` to evaluate possible combinations, which is particularly expensive for smaller values of `w`.
   - **Natural Language Description**: "For small values of `w`, the iteration count in loops becomes very high, leading to increased execution time due to the vast number of evaluations required."

These invariants capture the conditions under which the program enters a slow execution path, focusing on the core issue of handling small `w` with large `m`, resulting in an exponential number of combinations to explore. These statements abstract the core problems without relying on specific numeric values, making them applicable for a wide range of scenarios within the given constraints.

=== Checker Response ===
Let's start by implementing the performance-characterizing invariants as C++ checkers (Phase 3) and then integrate them into the provided solution (Phase 4).

### Phase 3: Implement the C++ Code for the Invariants

#### Invariant 1: Small Base Exponentiation
**Natural Language Description**: "If `w` is small, such as close to its minimum value of 2, the program explores a large number of power combinations, which increases computational complexity."

```cpp
void check_small_base_invariant(long long w) {
    if (w <= 3) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to small base w!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

#### Invariant 2: Large Search Space
**Natural Language Description**: "If `m` is large and `w` is small, the search space expands greatly due to the need to evaluate many combinations of powers of `w`, causing the program to slow down."

```cpp
void check_large_search_space(long long w, long long m) {
    if (w <= 3 && m > 1e8) {
        cerr << "Warning: Large search space due to small w and large m!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

#### Invariant 3: High Iteration Count
**Natural Language Description**: "For small values of `w`, the iteration count in loops becomes very high, leading to increased execution time due to the vast number of evaluations required."

```cpp
void check_high_iteration_count(long long w) {
    if (w <= 3) {
        cerr << "Warning: High iteration count likely due to small base w!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrate the Checkers into the Original Program

Here is the instrumented C++ code with the integrated checks:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Checker for small base exponentiation
void check_small_base_invariant(long long w) {
    if (w <= 3) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to small base w!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Checker for large search space
void check_large_search_space(long long w, long long m) {
    if (w <= 3 && m > 1e8) {
        cerr << "Warning: Large search space due to small w and large m!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Checker for high iteration count
void check_high_iteration_count(long long w) {
    if (w <= 3) {
        cerr << "Warning: High iteration count likely due to small base w!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    long long w, m;
    cin >> w >> m;
    
    // Insert checks after reading inputs
    check_small_base_invariant(w);
    check_large_search_space(w, m);
    check_high_iteration_count(w);
    
    if (w == 2) {
        cout << "YES";
        return 0;
    }
    
    vector<pair<long long, long long>> x;
    long long lim = 1;
    while ((lim <= m) and (lim <= (1e18 / w))) lim *= w;
    if (lim <= (1e18 / w)) lim *= w;
    
    for (long long mask = 0; mask <= (1ll << 30); mask++) {
        long long val = 0;
        bool flg = true;
        for (long long j = 0; j <= 30; j++) {
            if ((mask & (1ll << j)) != 0) {
                long long ex = pow(w, j);
                if (val > lim - ex) {
                    flg = false;
                    break;
                }
                val += ex;
            }
        }
        if (flg == false) break;
        x.push_back({val, mask});
    }
    sort(x.begin(), x.end());
    
    for (long long y = 0; y <= (1ll << 30); y++) {
        long long yval = 0;
        bool flg = true;
        for (long long j = 0; j <= 30; j++) {
            if ((y & (1ll << j)) != 0) {
                long long ex = pow(w, j);
                if (yval > m) {
                    flg = false;
                    break;
                }
                yval += ex;
            }
        }
        if (flg == false) break;
        auto it = lower_bound(x.begin(), x.end(), make_pair(m + yval, -1ll));
        if (it == x.end()) continue;
        if ((*it).first != m + yval) continue;
        if (((*it).second & y) != 0) continue;
        
        cout << "YES";
        return 0;
    }
    
    cout << "NO";
    return 0;
}
```

### Comments and Explanation

- **Check Placement**: The checks are placed right after input reading to avoid unnecessary overhead during loop execution. This ensures that the program halts early if a slow condition is detected.
- **Merged Checks**: The checks for "small base" and "high iteration count" are merged into a single condition since both are triggered by a small value of `w`.
- **Detecting Performance Bottlenecks**: These checks help in identifying performance bottlenecks, especially when the input values lead to conditions that may cause slowdown due to small base exponentiation and large search space iterations.
