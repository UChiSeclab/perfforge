### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Line-Level Hit Count Comparison:**
   - The function `asdd` and its recursive calls (lines 5-12) show significantly higher hit counts for the slow input compared to the fast input. 
   - Specifically, `asdd(q, s + 1)`, `asdd(q + a[s], s + 1)`, and `asdd(q - a[s], s + 1)` each have hit counts of 64,570,081 for the slow input but only 13 for the fast input.

2. **Interaction with Data Structures:**
   - The recursion in `asdd` explores different combinations of weights for balancing the scales, which leads to a large search space.
   - The degree of recursion is influenced by the array `a`, which stores powers of `w`. The larger the number of powers (i.e., the value of `i`), the deeper the recursion.

3. **Relation to Input Constraints:**
   - For the slow input, `w` is relatively smaller (4) compared to the fast input (1,000,000,000). Smaller `w` results in more elements in the array `a` because more powers of `w` fit within the limit `2 * 10^9`.
   - This increases the potential recursion depth, leading to more potential combinations being explored during the execution of `asdd`.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **Invariant #1: Impact of Smaller Base `w`**
   - Natural language: "When the base `w` is small, the program computes a large number of weight combinations, leading to increased recursion depth and potential slowdowns."
   - Possible threshold: Focus on smaller values of `w` leading to deeper recursion in `asdd`.

2. **Invariant #2: Large Search Space Exploration**
   - Natural language: "If the number of elements in the weights array grows large due to a small `w`, the recursive function `asdd` explores an extensive search space, causing performance to degrade."
   - Threshold suggestion: If `i` (the index of the last filled weight) becomes large, the recursive calls increase significantly.

3. **Invariant #3: Recursion Depth and Branching**
   - Natural language: "If the recursion depth becomes significant due to many potential branches at each level, the performance can suffer due to the exponential growth of explored states."
   - Threshold: Relate to the combination of `w` values and resulting depths. This can be exacerbated by larger `m` values which need more balancing.

These invariants offer a broad understanding of how the parameters of the problem, particularly the value of `w`, influence the performance by affecting the recursion depth and search space size. They provide a guide for considering performance implications of different input scenarios without relying on specific values from the test inputs.

### Phase 3: Implement the Natural Language Invariants in C++

Here are the runtime checks for the identified performance-characterizing invariants:

#### Invariant #1: Impact of Smaller Base `w`
```cpp
void check_small_base_invariant(long long int w) {
    if (w < 10) { // Threshold chosen due to significant slowdown observed for small w
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to small base w!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

#### Invariant #2: Large Search Space Exploration
```cpp
void check_large_search_space_invariant(int elements_count) {
    if (elements_count > 20) { // Assuming a reasonable threshold for recursion depth
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to large search space!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

#### Invariant #3: Recursion Depth and Branching
```cpp
void check_recursion_depth_invariant(int recursion_depth) {
    if (recursion_depth > 20) { // Assuming 20 as a threshold for excessive recursion depth
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to excessive recursion depth!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrate the Checker Code into the Original Program

Now, we integrate the checks into the original C++ program. We place the checks at strategic positions to avoid overhead in tight loops.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

long long int a[200], w, m, dp[200][4], i = 0;
bool mm = 0;

void check_small_base_invariant(long long int w) {
    if (w < 10) { // Threshold chosen due to significant slowdown observed for small w
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to small base w!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_large_search_space_invariant(int elements_count) {
    if (elements_count > 20) { // Assuming a reasonable threshold for recursion depth
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to large search space!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void asdd(long long int q, int s) {
    // Check recursion depth before proceeding
    check_recursion_depth_invariant(s);

    if (s == i + 1) {
        if (q == 0) mm = 1;
        return;
    }
    asdd(q, s + 1);
    asdd(q + a[s], s + 1);
    asdd(q - a[s], s + 1);
}

int main() {
    cin >> w >> m;

    // Check the small base invariant after reading inputs
    check_small_base_invariant(w);

    if (w == 2 || w == 3) {
        cout << "YES";
        return 0;
    }

    a[0] = 1;
    while (a[i] <= 2 * 1e9) {
        i++;
        a[i] = a[i - 1] * w;
    }

    // Check large search space invariant before recursion begins
    check_large_search_space_invariant(i);

    asdd(m, 0);

    if (mm)
        cout << "YES";
    else
        cout << "NO";

    return 0;
}
```

### Notes on the Code Integration
- The check for small base **w** is placed right after input reading, as it does not require the computation of powers.
- The recursion depth check is directly within the `asdd` function before diving deeper into the recursion.
- The large array check is done before the recursion starts, ensuring that the recursion space will not be excessively large.
- These checks should help detect performance bottlenecks related to small values of `w`, large recursion depths, and large search spaces.
