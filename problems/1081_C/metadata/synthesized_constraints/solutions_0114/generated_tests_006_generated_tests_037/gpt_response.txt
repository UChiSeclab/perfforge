### Phase 1: Identification of Expensive Code Segments

The primary focus for potential performance bottlenecks is the `ways` function, specifically:

- **Line 7 (Function Call):** The `ways` function itself is invoked a staggering 841,807 times with the slow input compared to only 21,463 times with the fast input. This indicates that the recursive calls within this function are significantly more frequent for the slow input.
  
- **Line 12 (Memoization Check):** The check for memoized results (`dp[n][k] != -1`) is hit 839,973 times in the slow case versus 21,171 times in the fast case. This suggests that memoization is not as effective in preventing redundant computations in the slow scenario.

- **Line 13 (Recursive Calculation):** The recursive calculation itself is executed 420,903 times in the slow run compared to only 10,731 times in the fast run, implying that the recursive depth or the branching involved is significantly larger for the slow input.

### Phase 2: Deriving Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the observed behavior of the `ways` function, we can derive the following performance-characterizing invariants in natural language:

1. **High Recursive Depth with Limited Memoization Effectiveness:**
   - **Invariant:** "When `n` is large and `k` is relatively small, the recursive depth of computations increases, leading to a significant number of function calls and recursive evaluations. This can occur when memoization is less effective due to unique `(n, k)` combinations in the recursive tree."
   - **Reasoning:** The slow input likely results from the need to explore many unique paths in the recursion tree, with limited reuse of previously computed results.

2. **Increased Recursive Branching Factor:**
   - **Invariant:** "If the branching factor, determined by the combinatorial growth of possible colorings as captured by `(M - 1)`, is substantial compared to the effective memoization and input constraints (n <= 2000), the computation becomes expensive."
   - **Reasoning:** The term `(M - 1)` in the recursive calls multiplies the number of branches that need to be evaluated, especially when `K` is not too large, which limits the pruning of these branches.

3. **Inefficient Memoization Utilization:**
   - **Invariant:** "When the complexity of different `(n, k)` paths is not effectively reduced through memoization, possibly due to a large space of possibilities with unique `(n, k)` pairs, the program experiences slower performance."
   - **Reasoning:** The frequent hits on the memoization check (line 12) indicate that the complexity might stem from insufficient overlap in subproblems being solved.

These invariants abstract the potential causes of slowdown without relying on exact data values, focusing instead on broader conditions that may lead to increased computational workload.

### Phase 3: Implementing Invariants as C++ Checkers

Here are the invariant checks implemented in C++ based on the natural language descriptions:

1. **High Recursive Depth with Limited Memoization Effectiveness:**

```cpp
void check_recursive_depth_invariant(int n, int k) {
    // Assuming a threshold where n is large and k is small increases recursive calls
    if (n > 1000 && k < 100) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high recursive depth with limited memoization!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

2. **Increased Recursive Branching Factor:**

```cpp
void check_branching_factor_invariant(int m, int k) {
    // Check if the branching factor is substantial
    if (k < m / 2 && m > 1000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - increased recursive branching factor!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

3. **Inefficient Memoization Utilization:**

```cpp
void check_memoization_invariant(int n, int k) {
    // Assuming inefficient memoization when many unique (n, k) combinations exist
    if (n * k > 1000000) { // This threshold assumes a large search space
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - inefficient memoization utilization!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrating Checkers into the Original Program

Below is the instrumented C++ code with the invariant checks integrated at appropriate points:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
const int MAXN = 2005;
const int MOD = 998244353;
int N, M, K;
long long dp[MAXN][MAXN];

// Invariant checkers
void check_recursive_depth_invariant(int n, int k) {
    if (n > 1000 && k < 100) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high recursive depth with limited memoization!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_branching_factor_invariant(int m, int k) {
    if (k < m / 2 && m > 1000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - increased recursive branching factor!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_memoization_invariant(int n, int k) {
    if (n * k > 1000000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - inefficient memoization utilization!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

long long ways(int n, int k) {
    // Before diving into the recursion, check for high recursion and branching factor
    check_recursive_depth_invariant(n, k);
    check_branching_factor_invariant(M, k); // Using global M

    if (n == 1) {
        if (k == 0) return M;
        return 0;
    }
    if (dp[n][k] != -1) return dp[n][k];

    // Recursive call
    return dp[n][k] = (ways(n - 1, k) + ways(n - 1, k - 1) * (M - 1) % MOD) % MOD;
}

int32_t main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(0);
    memset(dp, -1, sizeof dp);
    cin >> N >> M >> K;

    // Checking memoization inefficiency right after input
    check_memoization_invariant(N, K);

    cout << ways(N, K) << "\n";
}
```

### Explanation

- **Placement of Checks:** The invariant checks are placed strategically:
  - `check_recursive_depth_invariant` and `check_branching_factor_invariant` are called within the `ways` function before recursion to catch potential recursion issues.
  - `check_memoization_invariant` is placed in `main` after reading inputs to preemptively catch potential memoization inefficiencies across large input spaces.
- **Thresholds:** The thresholds are chosen based on likely conditions where recursive depth, branching factor, and memoization could lead to performance issues, considering the constraints `n, m <= 2000`. These are abstractions aimed at catching possible slow scenarios beyond the provided inputs.
