=== Invariants Response ===
To diagnose the performance issue based on the given information, let's follow the two phases outlined:

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Comparison of Hit Counts**:
   - The lines with notable differences in hit counts between the fast and slow inputs are:
     - Line 8 in `getsum`: Slow hit count = 1,449,250 vs. Fast hit count = 35,805
     - Line 15 in `fdp`: Slow hit count = 1,447,545 vs. Fast hit count = 34,100
     - Line 23 in `sdp`: Slow hit count = 780,300 vs. Fast hit count = 19,278
     - Line 24 in `sdp`: Slow hit count = 779,382 vs. Fast hit count = 18,360

2. **Analysis**:
   - The `getsum` function is called frequently in the slow input scenario, indicating potential inefficiencies in summing operations over `dp`.
   - The loop on line 15 in `fdp` updates each element of `dp[i][j]`, amounting to significant overhead when `m` is large.
   - In `sdp`, lines 23 and 24 involve nested loops over `n` and `k`, leading to extensive repeated calculations when `k` is large.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on this analysis, here are natural language performance invariants:

1. **Invariant 1: High Variation Count**:
   - "If the number of color variations `k` is large compared to the number of bricks `n`, the computation becomes expensive due to increased iterations for calculating possible color configurations."
   - This is due to the inner loop in the `sdp` function iterating up to `k+1`.

2. **Invariant 2: Large Color Space**:
   - "When the number of colors `m` is large, it results in substantial computational overhead for summing and updating operations, as seen in the `getsum` and `fdp` functions."
   - This affects the line responsible for iterating over all possible colors in `getsum`.

3. **Invariant 3: Extensive Dynamic Programming Table Updates**:
   - "If both `n` and `k` are near their upper limits, the program may slow significantly due to nested dynamic programming table updates."
   - This occurs with repeated updates across a potentially large `dp` table, whose size depends on `n` and `m`.

### Conclusion

These invariants focus on scenarios where either `k`, `m`, or both are large relative to `n`, triggering expensive computations due to extensive loop iterations and updates. These insights help characterize the slow path in the program, providing guidance for optimization or targeted testing.

### Phase 3: Implement the Natural Language Invariants in C++

Based on the performance-characterizing invariants identified earlier, here are the C++ code snippets to check each condition:

1. **Invariant 1: High Variation Count**  
   Check if `k` is large compared to `n`, which could cause extensive computations.

   ```cpp
   void check_high_variation_count(int n, int k) {
       if (k > n / 2) {  // Example threshold: when k is more than half of n
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high variation count!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Invariant 2: Large Color Space**  
   Check if `m` is large, as it leads to overhead in summing and updating operations.

   ```cpp
   void check_large_color_space(int m, int threshold) {
       if (m > threshold) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large color space!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Invariant 3: Extensive Dynamic Programming Table Updates**  
   Check if both `n` and `k` approach upper limits, leading to expensive table updates.

   ```cpp
   void check_extensive_dp_updates(int n, int k) {
       if (n > 1800 && k > 900) {  // Example thresholds close to upper boundaries
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - extensive DP updates!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Integrate Checkers into the Original C++ Program

Integrate these checks into the original program at suitable points:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
const int maxN = 2e3 + 9, lg = 19, MOD = 998244353, maxV = 1e6 + 9;
int n, m, k;
long long dp[maxN][maxN];

void check_high_variation_count(int n, int k) {
    if (k > n / 2) {  // Example threshold: when k is more than half of n
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high variation count!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_large_color_space(int m, int threshold = 1500) {  // Example threshold
    if (m > threshold) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large color space!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_extensive_dp_updates(int n, int k) {
    if (n > 1800 && k > 900) {  // Example thresholds close to upper boundaries
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - extensive DP updates!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

long long getsum(int i) {
    long long sm = 0;
    for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) sm = (sm + dp[i][j]) % MOD;
    return sm;
}

long long fdp() {
    for (int i = k; i >= 0; i--) {
        long long sm = getsum(i + 1);
        if (i == k) sm = 1;
        for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) dp[i][j] = (sm + MOD - dp[i + 1][j]) % MOD;
    }
    return getsum(0);
}

long long sdp() {
    memset(dp, 0, sizeof dp);
    dp[n][0] = 1;
    for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--)
        for (int j = 1; j <= k + 1; j++)
            dp[i][j] = (dp[i + 1][j] + dp[i + 1][j - 1]) % MOD;
    return dp[0][k + 1];
}

int main() {
    ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(0);
    cout.tie(0);
    cin >> n >> m >> k;
    
    // Performance-checking function calls
    check_high_variation_count(n, k);
    check_large_color_space(m);
    check_extensive_dp_updates(n, k);
    
    cout << fdp() * sdp() % MOD << '\n';
}
```

### Explanation

- **High Variation Count**: The check is placed after the input is read to quickly abort if `k` is too large.
- **Large Color Space**: A similar placement ensures quick detection if `m` exceeds the threshold.
- **Extensive DP Updates**: This check ensures the program is not running into potential performance issues due to excessive table updates, based on large `n` and `k`.

These checks are strategically placed to avoid adding overhead in critical loops, and they will help detect and debug slow performance scenarios effectively.
