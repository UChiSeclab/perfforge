=== Invariants Response ===
To analyze the performance bottlenecks in this C program, we will follow the given steps in Phases 1 and 2:

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Compare line-level hit counts**: 
   - From the hit count data, we observe that the recursive function `f(int i, int k)` has significantly higher hit counts for the slow input compared to the fast input.
   - Specifically, line 14 has a much higher hit count in the slow input (`420,903` vs. `10,731`), indicating that recursion is a significant contributor to the slowdown.

2. **Pinpoint lines or functions**:
   - The recursive function `f` is heavily invoked on both slow and fast inputs, but significantly more so on the slow input. This points to the recursion depth or branching factor being a problem area.
   
3. **Interactions with data structures and loops**:
   - The recursion is governed by the parameters `i` and `k`, which affect the depth and branching of the recursion. The presence of the state `dp[i][k]` indicates a dynamic programming approach, where memoization should help reduce repeated calculations. However, the large hit counts suggest that the recursion is exploring a large state space for the slow input.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **Generate natural language statements**:

   - **Invariant 1**: "When `n` is large, close to the upper limit of 2000, and `k` remains fixed or small while traversing large depths, the recursive function `f` explores a significantly large state space, causing repeated calculations, potentially leading to performance degradation."

   - **Invariant 2**: "If the recursion depth, defined by the parameter `i`, approaches `n` rapidly without reducing `k`, the function experiences a high branching factor, which degrades performance due to excessive recursive calls."

2. **Avoiding specific numeric values**:
   - The conditions are framed in terms of the relationship between `n`, `m`, and `k` rather than exact values from the slow input. This allows for detecting similar scenarios with different inputs while considering the constraints.

3. **Correlate these conditions to input patterns**:
   - "The function performance degrades when `n` is maximal or large, and `k` does not proportionally reduce, leading to high levels of recursion and state exploration."

4. **Broad yet realistic triggers**:
   - The conditions described are broad enough to capture various scenarios leading to slow execution while respecting constraints like `n <= 2000`.

### Conclusion

The analysis suggests that the primary cause of slow execution is tied to the recursion depth and the branching factor of the recursive function `f`. Performance can degrade significantly when large portions of the state space are explored under conditions of large `n` and relatively constant `k`. Utilization of the memoization table `dp` does not sufficiently mitigate the high number of recursive calls due to the structure of the problem and input constraints.

### Phase 3: Implementing the Natural Language Invariants in C++

For each natural language invariant derived earlier, we'll write C++ code snippets to check these conditions at runtime.

1. **Invariant 1**: When `n` is large and `k` remains fixed or small, recursion explores a large state space.
   ```cpp
   void check_large_n_small_k_invariant(int n, int k, int recursion_depth) {
       if (n > 1800 && k < 10 && recursion_depth > 500) { // Assuming 1800 and 10 as broad thresholds
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large n with small k leading to extensive recursion." << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Invariant 2**: If recursion depth approaches `n` rapidly without reducing `k`.
   ```cpp
   void check_recursion_depth_invariant(int i, int n, int k) {
       if (i > n - 10 && k > 0) { // Assuming a threshold where depth is close to n and k remains non-zero
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - recursion depth approaching n with non-reduced k." << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Integrating Checker Code into the Original Program

We will now integrate the checker code into the C++ solution program at appropriate points. The checks should not introduce overhead in performance-critical loops, so theyâ€™ll be placed strategically.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
const int INF = 0x3f3f3f3f;
const long long INFLL = 1e18;
const int MOD = 1e9 + 7;
const int MAXN = 3e5 + 5;
const int EMOD = 998244353;
int n, m, k;
long long dp[2222][2222];

// Checker functions
void check_large_n_small_k_invariant(int n, int k, int recursion_depth) {
    if (n > 1800 && k < 10 && recursion_depth > 500) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large n with small k leading to extensive recursion." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_recursion_depth_invariant(int i, int n, int k) {
    if (i > n - 10 && k > 0) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - recursion depth approaching n with non-reduced k." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

long long f(int i, int k, int depth) {
    // Check the invariants within the recursive function
    check_large_n_small_k_invariant(n, k, depth);
    check_recursion_depth_invariant(i, n, k);
    
    if (dp[i][k] != -1) return dp[i][k];
    if (!k && i == n) return 1LL;
    if (i == n) return 0LL;
    return dp[i][k] = ((m * f(i + 1, k - 1, depth + 1)) % EMOD + f(i + 1, k, depth + 1) % EMOD) % EMOD;
}

int main() {
    scanf("%d %d %d", &n, &m, &k);
    long long ans = m;
    m--;
    memset(dp, -1, sizeof(dp));
    ans = (ans * f(1, k, 0)) % EMOD;
    printf("%lld\n", ans);
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation
- **Checker Implementations**: The checker functions `check_large_n_small_k_invariant` and `check_recursion_depth_invariant` are implemented to capture the conditions described in the invariants.
- **Integration**: These functions are called within the recursive function `f`, with appropriate checks on the conditions that may lead to performance bottlenecks.
- **Thresholds**: These thresholds (e.g., `n > 1800`, `k < 10`, recursion depth exceeding 500, etc.) were chosen based on the problem's constraints and are broad enough to capture potential bottlenecks without being too restrictive. Adjustments can be made based on empirical testing or further insights.
