=== Invariants Response ===
To analyze the performance bottlenecks in the given C program, we need to focus on the hit count information for both the slow and fast inputs. Here's a step-by-step approach followed by performance-characterizing invariants:

### Phase 1: Identifying Expensive Code Segments

1. **Line-Level Hit Count Analysis:**
   - **Line 34 (`for (int j = 0; j <= k; j++)`):** This line has a significantly higher hit count for the slow input (779,450) compared to the fast input (19,257). This indicates that the nested loop is the primary source of slowdown.
   - **Line 35 (`dp[i][j] = (dp[i - 1][j] % M + dp[i - 1][j - 1] % M * (m - 1) % M) % M`):** This line, which performs updates to the `dp` array, also shows a high hit count in the slow input, corresponding to the iterations of the nested loop.

2. **Interaction with Data Structures:**
   - The nested loops iterate over `n` and `k`, where `n` is the number of bricks and `k` is the number of bricks with a color different from the previous brick. The dynamic programming table `dp` is populated based on these loops.

3. **Impact of Input Constraints:**
   - The primary constraint causing a slowdown is the value of `k`. The slow input has a high `k` value, resulting in large iterations for the inner loop.

### Phase 2: Deriving Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the analysis from Phase 1, here are the performance-characterizing invariants in natural language:

1. **Invariant for High `k` Values:**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "If the number of bricks with a different color from the previous brick (`k`) is high relative to the total number of bricks (`n`), the dynamic programming approach iterates extensively over potential combinations, leading to significant slowdowns."
   - **Threshold Consideration:** Given the constraints `1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000` and `0 ≤ k ≤ n-1`, a high `k`, especially close to `n`, triggers this condition.

2. **Invariant for Nested Loop Depth:**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "When the dynamic programming table is large due to a high value of `k`, the nested loops over `n` and `k` result in a large number of calculations, causing performance degradation."
   - **Threshold Consideration:** This is particularly relevant when `k` is a significant fraction of `n`, e.g., `k` approaching `n/2` or more.

3. **Invariant for Computational Overhead in Nested Loops:**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "Frequent computations and modulus operations within nested loops over large indices can result in slowdowns, especially when the range of indices (`k`) is large."
   - **Threshold Consideration:** The repeated modulus operations in the loop can become costly when `k` is large, as many as `n * k` operations might be executed.

By considering these invariants, we can anticipate future scenarios where similar slowdowns might occur, allowing optimizations or refactoring to be considered.

=== Checker Response ===
Below are the necessary steps to translate the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the original C++ program.

### Phase 3: Implementing the Natural Language Invariants in C++

For each invariant from Phase 2, we'll write a C++ checker function:

1. **Invariant: High `k` Values**
   ```cpp
   void check_high_k_invariant(int n, int k) {
       if (k > n / 2) {
           cerr << "Warning: High 'k' value may cause performance bottleneck!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Invariant: Nested Loop Depth**
   ```cpp
   void check_nested_loop_invariant(int n, int k) {
       if (k * n > 1000000) {  // Example threshold based on problem constraints
           cerr << "Warning: Nested loops with high indices may cause slowdowns!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Invariant: Computational Overhead in Nested Loops**
   ```cpp
   void check_computation_invariant(int n, int k, int m) {
       if (k > 0.8 * n && m > 100) {  // Hypothetical condition for detecting heavy operations
           cerr << "Warning: High computational overhead detected!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Integrating the Checks into the Original Program

Now we'll integrate these checks into the original C++ program, placing them effectively to avoid adding overhead within tight loops:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

const int N = (int)2e3 + 5;
const long long M = (long long)998244353;
long long dp[N][N];
int n, k, m;

void check_high_k_invariant(int n, int k) {
    if (k > n / 2) {
        cerr << "Warning: High 'k' value may cause performance bottleneck!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_nested_loop_invariant(int n, int k) {
    if (k * n > 1000000) {  // Example threshold based on problem constraints
        cerr << "Warning: Nested loops with high indices may cause slowdowns!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_computation_invariant(int n, int k, int m) {
    if (k > 0.8 * n && m > 100) {  // Hypothetical condition for detecting heavy operations
        cerr << "Warning: High computational overhead detected!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    cin >> n >> m >> k;

    // Check performance invariants based on input conditions
    check_high_k_invariant(n, k);
    check_nested_loop_invariant(n, k);
    check_computation_invariant(n, k, m);

    long long res = 0ll;
    dp[1][0] = m;
    for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j <= k; j++) {
            dp[i][j] = (dp[i - 1][j] % M + dp[i - 1][j - 1] % M * (m - 1) % M) % M;
        }
    }
    cout << dp[n][k] << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

- **Placement of Checks:** The checks are inserted immediately after reading the input values, before any heavy computation begins. This ensures that performance bottlenecks are detected early without adding overhead to the main computation loops.
- **Thresholds and Conditions:** The conditions in each check are based on reasonable assumptions derived from the problem constraints and observed slow input behavior. They are designed to be broad enough to detect potential performance issues while avoiding false positives for typical input scenarios.
