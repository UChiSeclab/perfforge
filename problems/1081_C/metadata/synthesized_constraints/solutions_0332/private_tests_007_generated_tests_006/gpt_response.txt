=== Invariants Response ===
To identify and derive performance-characterizing invariants from the given C code and input data, we'll follow the outlined phases.

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Compare Line-Level Hit Counts:**
   - Significant discrepancy is observed in the `binomialCoeff` function, specifically in the nested loop on lines 123-129. The slow input results in significantly more hits than the fast input.
   - The `power` function also shows different behavior in terms of hit counts, particularly in the loop spanning lines 29-32, although the impact seems secondary compared to the `binomialCoeff`.

2. **Pinpoint Lines/Functions with More Hits on Slow Input:**
   - **`binomialCoeff(n, k)`:** The inner loop at line 124 is executed 781,150 times for the slow input versus 19,299 times for the fast input, indicating a quadratic time complexity relative to `n` and `k`.
   - **`power(m - 1, k, 998244353)`:** The loop runs 11 times for the slow input compared to 6 times for the fast input.

3. **Infer Interactions with Data Structures and Constraints:**
   - The `binomialCoeff` function is heavily dependent on the values of `n` and `k`, where `n` represents the number of bricks and `k` the number of color changes.
   - Given constraints (e.g., `n` and `k` both â‰¤ 2000), the nested loops become a significant factor when both `n` and `k` are large.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **Natural Language Statements Describing Slow Path Conditions:**

   - **Invariant #1: Nested Binomial Coefficient Computation**
     - Condition: "If both `n` (number of bricks) and `k` (number of color changes) are large, the binomial coefficient computation may involve significant nested iteration, slowing down the program."
     - Implementation Suggestion:
       ```cpp
       void check_binomial_invariant(bool condition) {
           if (condition) {
               cerr << "Warning: binomial_invariant triggered - intensive binomial coefficient computation" << endl;
               abort();
           }
       }
       check_binomial_invariant(n > 1500 && k > 1500);
       ```

   - **Invariant #2: Exponentiation Over Large Values**
     - Condition: "If `k` (number of color changes) is large, the power function may perform many multiplications leading to longer execution times."
     - Implementation Suggestion:
       ```cpp
       void check_power_invariant(bool condition) {
           if (condition) {
               cerr << "Warning: power_invariant triggered - excessive computations in power function" << endl;
               abort();
           }
       }
       check_power_invariant(k > 1500);
       ```

2. **Correlate Conditions to Input Patterns:**
   - These conditions highlight situations where both the number of bricks and allowed color changes approach their maximum constraints. This is critical as it reflects potential inefficiencies in handling larger combinatorial computations.

3. **Broad Yet Realistic Triggers:**
   - The proposed checks focus on broad categories where both dimensions (`n` and `k`) are large but without relying on specific input values, thus ensuring they are applicable to future inputs respecting the constraints.

In summary, the code's performance bottlenecks are primarily due to the extensive nested computations linked to large combinatorial problems as both `n` and `k` grow. The invariants suggest monitoring these cases to preemptively identify potential slowdowns.

### Phase 3: Implementing Natural Language Invariants as C++ Checkers

Below are the C++ checkers for the performance-characterizing invariants we derived:

1. **Checker for Nested Binomial Coefficient Computation**
```cpp
void check_binomial_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - intensive binomial coefficient computation!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

2. **Checker for Exponentiation Over Large Values**
```cpp
void check_power_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive computations in power function!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrating Checkers into the C++ Program

Now we integrate these checkers into the original program. We'll place the checks after reading inputs to avoid adding overhead in tight loops. 

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Checkers for performance bottlenecks
void check_binomial_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - intensive binomial coefficient computation!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_power_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive computations in power function!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Function declarations
long long power(long long x, long long y, long long p);
void binomialCoeff(long long n, long long k);

long long C[2001][2000];

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);
    
    long long n, m, k;
    cin >> n >> m >> k;

    // Performance bottleneck checks
    check_binomial_invariant(n > 1500 && k > 1500); // Checks for expensive binomial coefficient computation
    check_power_invariant(k > 1500); // Checks for excessive power computations

    binomialCoeff(n, k);
    
    long long mminus1 = power(m - 1, k, 998244353);
    mminus1 %= 998244353;
    long long ans = 1;
    ans *= mminus1 % 998244353;
    ans = ((ans % 998244353) * (m)) % 998244353;
    ans = ((ans % 998244353) * (C[n - 1][k])) % 998244353;
    cout << ans << endl;
    return 0;
}

long long power(long long x, long long y, long long p) {
    long long res = 1;
    x = x % p;
    while (y > 0) {
        if (y & 1) res = (res * x) % p;
        y = y >> 1;
        x = (x * x) % p;
    }
    return res;
}

void binomialCoeff(long long n, long long k) {
    long long i, j;
    for (i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
        for (j = 0; j <= k; j++) {
            if (j == 0 || j == i)
                C[i][j] = 1;
            else
                C[i][j] = (C[i - 1][j - 1] % 998244353 + C[i - 1][j] % 998244353) % 998244353;
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation:

- **Checker Integration:**
  - **`check_binomial_invariant`**: This is placed after reading inputs to ensure `n` and `k` are large enough to potentially cause a slowdown due to nested loops in `binomialCoeff`.
  - **`check_power_invariant`**: This is used similarly, checking if `k` is large enough to cause excessive execution in the `power` function.

By integrating these checks, we can now detect scenarios where the program is likely to run slowly due to computationally intensive operations. These checks help identify performance bottlenecks during testing and debugging.
