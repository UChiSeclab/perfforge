=== Invariants Response ===
To diagnose the performance bottleneck in the provided C program, let's analyze the hit count information and identify the expensive code segments. Afterward, we'll derive performance-characterizing invariants in natural language.

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

**Analysis of Hit Counts:**

The function `fun` is the main recursion function that implements a dynamic programming approach to solve the problem. Here are some observations:

1. **Line 18 (`fun` function declaration):** 
   - Slow hit count: 841,808
   - Fast hit count: 21,464
   
2. **Line 19 (`if (i == n + 1) {`):**
   - Slow hit count: 841,808
   - Fast hit count: 21,464
   
3. **Line 25 (`if (dp[i][c] != -1) return dp[i][c];`):**
   - Slow hit count: 839,974
   - Fast hit count: 21,172

4. **Line 29-30 (recursive call for calculating dp[i][c]):**
   - Slow hit count: 420,903
   - Fast hit count: 10,731

The `fun` function gets significantly more hits for the slow input compared to the fast input, especially the recursive calls at lines 29-30. This indicates that the recursion depth and the number of states being evaluated are much larger for the slow input.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on our analysis, we can derive the following performance-characterizing invariants:

1. **Invariant #1: Large Recursive State Space**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "If the number of bricks `n` is large, the recursive state space becomes vast, leading to performance degradation. This is especially true when `n` approaches its upper limit and `k` requires exploring many state combinations, significantly increasing the number of recursive calls."
   
2. **Invariant #2: High Recursive Call Overhead**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "When the number of bricks `n` is large, and the difference constraints `k` necessitate frequent changes in brick colors, the recursive function `fun` is invoked excessively. This results in high computational overhead due to the repeated calculations in the dynamic programming approach."

3. **Invariant #3: Large Dynamic Programming Table**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "As `n` increases, the size of the dynamic programming table grows, which increases memory usage and reduces cache efficiency. This contributes to slower performance when the input size is near its maximum constraints."

By identifying these conditions, we recognize that the slowdown occurs primarily due to the increased recursion depth and the larger state space that needs to be explored. This is exacerbated when `n` is large and `k` requires many color changes, leading to a significant computational burden.

=== Checker Response ===
Let's implement the performance-characterizing invariants as runtime checks in C++. We'll then integrate these checks into the original program.

### Phase 3: Implement the Invariants as C++ Checkers

Based on the derived invariants, we'll create checkers to monitor potential performance bottlenecks:

1. **Invariant 1 Check - Large Recursive State Space:**

```cpp
void check_large_recursive_state_space(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck - large recursive state space detected!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

2. **Invariant 2 Check - High Recursive Call Overhead:**

```cpp
void check_high_recursive_call_overhead(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck - high recursive call overhead detected!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

3. **Invariant 3 Check - Large Dynamic Programming Table:**

```cpp
void check_large_dp_table(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck - large dynamic programming table detected!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrate the Checkers into the Program

We'll integrate these checks at appropriate points in the original C++ program. The checks should be placed after reading inputs but before the recursive function is heavily invoked.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

inline long long min2(long long a, long long b) {
    return (a) < (b) ? (a) : (b);
}

inline long long max2(long long a, long long b) {
    return (a) > (b) ? (a) : (b);
}

inline long long max3(long long a, long long b, long long c) {
    return (a) > (b) ? ((a) > (c) ? (a) : (c)) : ((b) > (c) ? (b) : (c));
}

inline long long min3(long long a, long long b, long long c) {
    return (a) < (b) ? ((a) < (c) ? (a) : (c)) : ((b) < (c) ? (b) : (c));
}

using namespace std::chrono;

long long int n, m, k;
long long int dp[2001][2001];

void check_large_recursive_state_space(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck - large recursive state space detected!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_high_recursive_call_overhead(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck - high recursive call overhead detected!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_large_dp_table(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck - large dynamic programming table detected!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

long long int fun(long long int i, long long int c) {
    if (i == n + 1) {
        if (c == k)
            return 1;
        else
            return 0;
    }

    if (dp[i][c] != -1) return dp[i][c];

    if (i == 1)
        dp[i][c] = (m * fun(i + 1, c)) % 998244353;
    else
        dp[i][c] = (((m - 1) * fun(i + 1, c + 1)) % 998244353 +
                    (1 * fun(i + 1, c)) % 998244353) %
                   998244353;

    return dp[i][c];
}

void process() {
    cin >> n >> m >> k;
    memset(dp, -1, sizeof(dp));

    // Check #1: Large recursive state space
    check_large_recursive_state_space(n > 1500);

    // Check #2: High recursive call overhead
    check_high_recursive_call_overhead(n > 1500 && k > 0.75 * n);

    // Check #3: Large dynamic programming table
    check_large_dp_table(n * k > 2000000);

    cout << fun(1, 0) << endl;
}

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);
    cout.tie(NULL);

    process();
}
```

### Explanation of Inserted Checks

- **Check for Large Recursive State Space:** This check is triggered when `n` exceeds a threshold (e.g., 1500), indicating that the state space of recursion could be too large.
- **Check for High Recursive Call Overhead:** This check is activated for large `n` and when `k` is a significant fraction of `n`, potentially leading to high overhead due to frequent changes in colors.
- **Check for Large Dynamic Programming Table:** This check monitors if the product `n * k` exceeds a certain threshold, indicating a potentially large DP table impacting performance.

These checks aim to alert you when typical performance bottlenecks may occur, helping ensure efficient execution as input sizes vary.
