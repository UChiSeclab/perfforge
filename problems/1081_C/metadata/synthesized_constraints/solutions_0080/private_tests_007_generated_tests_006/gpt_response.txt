### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

By comparing the line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs, we can pinpoint the source of inefficiency:

- **Line 11 `for (int j = 0; <= k; j++)`:** This line shows a significant increase in execution count for the slow input compared to the fast input (779,450 hits vs. 19,257 hits). It is clear that the inner loop is executed far more times in the slow input case.
  
- **Lines 12 and 13 (`dp[i][j] = ...`):** These lines are directly affected by the number of iterations of the inner loop and exhibit a similar pattern to the loop itself. For each iteration of the inner loop, these two lines perform calculations that result in a high number of operations when `k` is large.

The key observation here is that the value of `k` significantly influences the number of iterations of the inner loop, thereby affecting the overall performance. With `k` being close to `n` (848 vs. 918), the inner loop iterates many more times compared to when `k` is small (e.g., 19 in the fast input).

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Here are the performance-characterizing invariants for the code:

1. **High Variation Count:**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "When the number of changes in brick colors (`k`) is close to the total number of bricks (`n`), the code enters a slow path due to excessive iterations in the nested loop."
   - **Explanation:** The loop runs `k + 1` times for each outer loop iteration. Thus, when `k` is large, the number of operations grows significantly, leading to performance degradation.

2. **High Loop Iterations:**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "If the inner loop (which iterates over possible changes in color) is executed close to its maximum capacity (i.e., `k` is large), the program may slow down considerably due to the cumulative cost of repeated calculations."
   - **Explanation:** With a large `k`, the variety of color configurations the code needs to compute is high, resulting in more complex calculations within the loop.

3. **Resource-Intensive Calculations:**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "In scenarios where `k` (the count of color variations) is large relative to `n`, the required computations for dynamic programming become resource-intensive, especially in the `dp` table updates."
   - **Explanation:** The dynamic programming table updates, coupled with large iteration counts, contribute to the overall slow execution time when `k` approaches `n`.

These invariants abstract the slow input conditions effectively without relying on specific input values, focusing instead on the input's structural attributes, such as `k` being large relative to `n`.

=== Checker Response ===
### Phase 3: Implement the Natural Language Invariants as C++ Checkers

Based on the performance-characterizing invariants, we will write C++ checkers that will capture the conditions under which the program is expected to slow down.

Here are the C++ checkers for each invariant:

```cpp
void check_high_variation_count(int n, int k) {
    // Invariant 1: High Variation Count
    if (k > 0.9 * n) { // Using 90% of n as a threshold for 'close to n'
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - High variation count!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_high_loop_iterations(int n, int k) {
    // Invariant 2: High Loop Iterations
    if (k > 0.8 * n) { // Using 80% of n as a threshold for high loop iterations
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - High loop iterations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_resource_intensive_calculations(int n, int k) {
    // Invariant 3: Resource-Intensive Calculations
    if (k > 0.85 * n) { // Using 85% of n as a threshold
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - Resource-intensive calculations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrate Checkers into the Original C++ Program

Now, let's integrate these checkers into the original program. The checks will be placed after input reading but before the main computation loop to ensure we catch potential performance issues early without adding overhead to the tight loops.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
const int maxn = 2005;
const long long mod = 998244353;
using namespace std;
long long dp[maxn][maxn];

void check_high_variation_count(int n, int k) {
    if (k > 0.9 * n) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - High variation count!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_high_loop_iterations(int n, int k) {
    if (k > 0.8 * n) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - High loop iterations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_resource_intensive_calculations(int n, int k) {
    if (k > 0.85 * n) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - Resource-intensive calculations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    int n, m, k;
    scanf("%d%d%d", &n, &m, &k);

    // Insert checks after input reading
    check_high_variation_count(n, k);  // Check for high variation count
    check_high_loop_iterations(n, k);  // Check for high loop iterations
    check_resource_intensive_calculations(n, k);  // Check for resource-intensive calculations

    dp[1][0] = m;
    for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j <= k; j++) {
            dp[i][j] = (dp[i][j] + dp[i - 1][j]) % mod;
            dp[i][j] = (dp[i][j] + dp[i - 1][j - 1] * (m - 1) % mod) % mod;
        }
    }
    cout << dp[n][k] << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Checker Functions:** These are strategically placed to monitor the conditions `k` relative to `n` just after reading the input.
- **Thresholds:** The thresholds (90%, 80%, 85% of `n`) are chosen to reflect when `k` is significantly large compared to `n`, indicating potential performance bottlenecks.
- **Flow Integration:** They are placed before the main computational logic to avoid impacting the performance of the nested loops within the dynamic programming solution.
