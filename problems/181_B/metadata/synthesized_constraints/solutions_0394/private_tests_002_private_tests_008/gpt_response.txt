=== Invariants Response ===
To analyze the given C program and derive performance-characterizing invariants, let's proceed through the phases:

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Comparison of Line-Level Hit Counts:**
   - **Outer Loop (Lines 15-23):** The outer loop (line 15) runs `n` times, and the inner loop (line 16) runs approximately `n/2` times for each iteration of the outer loop. This results in a quadratic number of iterations, which is a key factor in performance differences.
   - **Midpoint Calculation and Lookup (Lines 17-19):** For each pair of points `(i, j)`, the code calculates the midpoint `(a, b)` and checks if it exists in the map `mp` (lines 17-19). This is executed frequently and contributes significantly to the slowdown, especially with larger `n`.
   - **Conditional Check and Update (Lines 20-21):** The condition and increment operations (lines 20-21) are hit less often but are crucial when they occur.

2. **Pinpointing Lines with More Hits on Slow Input:**
   - **Lines 15, 16:** Both loop lines are hit 41 and 820 times, respectively, in the slow input, compared to 4 and 6 times in the fast input. This reflects the `O(n^2)` complexity.
   - **Lines 17-19:** These calculations and lookups are also hit quite frequently, with 780 hits in the slow input compared to 3 hits in the fast input.

3. **Inference on Data Structures and Execution:**
   - The quadratic nature of the loops directly relates to the size of input `n`. The midpoint calculations and map lookups can become costly as `n` increases, especially if many midpoints match points in the input list.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants (Natural Language)

Based on the analysis of code behavior and hit counts, we can derive the following invariants:

1. **Nested Loop Complexity:**
   - **Natural Language Invariant:** "As the number of points `n` increases towards its upper limit, the nested loop structure leads to quadratic growth in computations, potentially causing significant slowdowns when `n` is large."
   - **Condition:** The loop structure effectively performs `O(n^2)` operations, which becomes a bottleneck especially as `n` approaches 3000.

2. **Midpoint Calculation and Lookup:**
   - **Natural Language Invariant:** "When many pairs of points have integer-coordinate midpoints that match other points, frequent map lookups can degrade performance significantly."
   - **Condition:** The map's operation becomes costly, especially when the number of potential midpoints to check is high and aligns with actual points.

3. **Frequent Map Access:**
   - **Natural Language Invariant:** "If the density of points allows for many pairwise midpoint mappings to existing points, repeated access and potential contention in the map can lead to performance degradation."
   - **Condition:** The efficiency of the map lookup is crucial, and excessive access patterns can bottle-neck execution, particularly at high values of `n`.

These invariants focus on the core performance risks associated with the algorithm's logic and input conditions without specifying exact input values, thus making them applicable to a broad set of potential scenarios. They align with the problem constraints and help foresee potential performance bottlenecks as `n` increases.

=== Checker Response ===
### Phase 3: Implement the Natural Language Invariants in C++

Based on the performance-characterizing invariants derived earlier, we'll create C++ functions that check those conditions at runtime.

#### Invariant 1: Nested Loop Complexity
```cpp
void check_nested_loop_invariant(long long n) {
    // This checker will warn if n is near the upper limit, causing a potential O(n^2) bottleneck
    if (n > 2500) { // A threshold chosen to be close to the maximum but not too conservative
        cerr << "Warning: nested_loop_invariant triggered - potential O(n^2) performance bottleneck" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

#### Invariant 2: Midpoint Calculation and Lookup
```cpp
void check_midpoint_lookup_invariant(long long potentialMidpoints, long long n) {
    // Warn if the number of potential midpoints is very high relative to the number of points
    if (potentialMidpoints > n * (n - 1) / 4) { // A heuristic threshold for excessive midpoint checks
        cerr << "Warning: midpoint_lookup_invariant triggered - excessive midpoints being checked" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrate Checkers into the Original Program

Now we will integrate these checks effectively into the existing C++ program, ensuring they don't add overhead in tight loops.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Checker for nested loop complexity
void check_nested_loop_invariant(long long n) {
    if (n > 2500) {
        cerr << "Warning: nested_loop_invariant triggered - potential O(n^2) performance bottleneck" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Checker for midpoint calculation and lookup
void check_midpoint_lookup_invariant(long long potentialMidpoints, long long n) {
    if (potentialMidpoints > n * (n - 1) / 4) {
        cerr << "Warning: midpoint_lookup_invariant triggered - excessive midpoints being checked" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    long long n, i, j;
    cin >> n;

    // Check for potential performance bottlenecks based on input size
    check_nested_loop_invariant(n);

    vector<pair<double, double>> v(n);
    map<pair<double, double>, long long> mp;
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        double a, b;
        cin >> a >> b;
        mp[{a, b}] = i;
        v[i] = {a, b};
    }

    long long ans = 0;
    long long potentialMidpoints = 0;

    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
            double a = (v[i].first + v[j].first) / 2.0;
            double b = (v[i].second + v[j].second) / 2.0;
            potentialMidpoints++;
            if (mp.find({a, b}) != mp.end()) {
                long long c = mp[{a, b}];
                if (c != i && c != j) ans++;
            }
        }
    }

    // Check for excessive midpoint calculations
    check_midpoint_lookup_invariant(potentialMidpoints, n);

    cout << ans;
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
- **`check_nested_loop_invariant`:** This function checks if `n` is dangerously high, suggesting potential quadratic complexity issues.
- **`check_midpoint_lookup_invariant`:** This function checks if the number of potential midpoint computations is very large relative to the number of points, indicating possible performance degradation.
- **Placement of Checks:** The `check_nested_loop_invariant` is placed immediately after reading `n` to catch any input that might lead to performance concerns. The `check_midpoint_lookup_invariant` is called after the nested loops to assess the extent of midpoint calculations, ensuring the check is not within the loop body itself to avoid further performance overhead.
