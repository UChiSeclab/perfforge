### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Comparison of Hit Counts**:
   - The `middle` function (lines 3-4) is called 780 times in the slow input, compared to just 3 times in the fast input. This is a significant difference.
   - The nested loop in the `main` function (lines 14-16) executes 820 times for the slow input and only 6 times for the fast input.

2. **Identification of High Frequency Lines**:
   - Line 16 (`res += points.count(middle(v[i], v[j]));`) is linked to both the `middle` function call and the `points.count` operation. This line is executed 780 times in the slow input, indicating that it is a performance bottleneck.

3. **Analysis of Data Structure Interaction**:
   - The `points` set is used to count the middle point. If the resulting middle point from every pair (i, j) is checked in the set, this can be costly, especially as the number of pairs grows with `n`.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **Invariant 1: High Pair Combinations**:
   - **Natural Language**: "The program may slow down when the number of point pairs (i, j) to evaluate is large, especially near the maximum input size, as this leads to excessive computation in nested loops."
   - **Explanation**: The nested loops iterate over pairs of points, and the operations within (like checking for the middle point) become expensive when `n` is large.

2. **Invariant 2: Frequent Middle Point Checks**:
   - **Natural Language**: "Performance degradation is likely if the middle point between pairs of points frequently results in valid points from the set, requiring many costly checks and additions."
   - **Explanation**: When many pairs of points have a middle point that is also a defined point from the input, it results in repeated costly checks in the set.

3. **Invariant 3: Input Distribution Complexity**:
   - **Natural Language**: "When the input points are positioned such that many pairs of points can form a valid middle point, the computation becomes more intensive, especially as `n` increases."
   - **Explanation**: Certain configurations of input points may naturally lead to more valid middle points, exacerbating the count operation tasks.

### Summary

These invariants recognize that the primary issue arises from the quadratic growth of pair combinations as `n` increases (up to 3000), leading to exponential growth in the number of times computationally expensive operations are executed. Furthermore, configurations of input points that yield many valid middle points within the set can exacerbate the situation. To mitigate this, algorithmic optimizations would need to focus on reducing unnecessary checks or employing more efficient data structures.

### Phase 3: Implementing Performance-Characterizing Invariants in C++

Below are the C++ code snippets that check the conditions identified in the natural language invariants during Phase 2:

```cpp
// Check if the number of point pairs is large, potentially leading to excessive computation.
void check_pair_combinations_invariant(long long n) {
    // The threshold is set arbitrarily close to the maximum input size.
    if ((n * (n - 1)) / 2 > 4000000) { // n choose 2, with n near maximum.
        cerr << "Warning: pair_combinations_invariant triggered - excessive point pair evaluations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Check if there are frequent middle point checks that can degrade performance.
void check_middle_point_invariant(long long middlePointChecks) {
    // Assume a threshold for middle points checks that indicates potential performance issues.
    if (middlePointChecks > 1000000) {
        cerr << "Warning: middle_point_invariant triggered - frequent valid middle point checks!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Check if input distribution complexity can lead to intensive computation.
void check_input_distribution_invariant(long long validMiddlePoints) {
    // Threshold for valid middle point checks.
    if (validMiddlePoints > 100000) {
        cerr << "Warning: input_distribution_invariant triggered - complex input distribution!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrating Checker Code into the Original Program

Below is the instrumented C++ code, incorporating the checker functions to effectively detect the identified bottlenecks:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

pair<double, double> middle(pair<double, double> a, pair<double, double> b) {
  return make_pair((a.first + b.first) / 2, (b.second + a.second) / 2);
}

// Check if the number of point pairs is large, potentially leading to excessive computation.
void check_pair_combinations_invariant(long long n) {
    // The threshold is set arbitrarily close to the maximum input size.
    if ((n * (n - 1)) / 2 > 4000000) { // n choose 2, with n near maximum.
        cerr << "Warning: pair_combinations_invariant triggered - excessive point pair evaluations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Check if there are frequent middle point checks that can degrade performance.
void check_middle_point_invariant(long long middlePointChecks) {
    // Assume a threshold for middle points checks that indicates potential performance issues.
    if (middlePointChecks > 1000000) {
        cerr << "Warning: middle_point_invariant triggered - frequent valid middle point checks!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Check if input distribution complexity can lead to intensive computation.
void check_input_distribution_invariant(long long validMiddlePoints) {
    // Threshold for valid middle point checks.
    if (validMiddlePoints > 100000) {
        cerr << "Warning: input_distribution_invariant triggered - complex input distribution!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

signed main() {
  long long n;
  cin >> n;
  
  // Insert the check for pair combinations invariant right after reading n
  check_pair_combinations_invariant(n);
  
  vector<pair<double, double> > v(n);
  set<pair<double, double> > points;
  for (long long i = 0; i < n; i++)
    cin >> v[i].first >> v[i].second, points.insert(v[i]);
  
  long long res = 0;
  long long middlePointChecks = 0; // Count the number of middle point checks
  long long validMiddlePoints = 0; // Count the number of valid middle points

  for (long long i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    for (long long j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
      middlePointChecks++;
      if (points.count(middle(v[i], v[j]))) {
        res++;
        validMiddlePoints++;
      }
    }
  }
  
  // Check for the middle point invariant after processing all pairs
  check_middle_point_invariant(middlePointChecks);
  check_input_distribution_invariant(validMiddlePoints);
  
  cout << res << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

- **Pair Combinations Invariant**: The check is placed right after reading `n`, as it depends on the number of possible pairs, which is calculated using the formula for combinations.
- **Middle Point Checks**: The count for middle point checks is tracked during the nested loop, and the check is performed after the loop to ensure it doesn't disrupt performance.
- **Valid Middle Points**: Similarly, valid middle points are counted and checked after processing, allowing the program to detect configurations that result in frequent hits.

This implementation provides a mechanism to detect potential performance bottlenecks, helping improve the understanding and optimization of the program's execution.
