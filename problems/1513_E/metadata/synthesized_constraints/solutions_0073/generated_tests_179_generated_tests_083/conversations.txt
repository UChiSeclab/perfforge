system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

An array is called beautiful if all the elements in the array are equal.

You can transform an array using the following steps any number of times: 

  1. Choose two indices i and j (1 ≤ i,j ≤ n), and an integer x (1 ≤ x ≤ a_i). Let i be the source index and j be the sink index. 
  2. Decrease the i-th element by x, and increase the j-th element by x. The resulting values at i-th and j-th index are a_i-x and a_j+x respectively. 
  3. The cost of this operation is x ⋅ |j-i| . 
  4. Now the i-th index can no longer be the sink and the j-th index can no longer be the source. 

The total cost of a transformation is the sum of all the costs in step 3.

For example, array [0, 2, 3, 3] can be transformed into a beautiful array [2, 2, 2, 2] with total cost 1 ⋅ |1-3| + 1 ⋅ |1-4| = 5.

An array is called balanced, if it can be transformed into a beautiful array, and the cost of such transformation is uniquely defined. In other words, the minimum cost of transformation into a beautiful array equals the maximum cost.

You are given an array a_1, a_2, …, a_n of length n, consisting of non-negative integers. Your task is to find the number of balanced arrays which are permutations of the given array. Two arrays are considered different, if elements at some position differ. Since the answer can be large, output it modulo 10^9 + 7.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — the size of the array. 

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9).

Output

Output a single integer — the number of balanced permutations modulo 10^9+7.

Note

In the first example, [1, 2, 3] is a valid permutation as we can consider the index with value 3 as the source and index with value 1 as the sink. Thus, after conversion we get a beautiful array [2, 2, 2], and the total cost would be 2. We can show that this is the only transformation of this array that leads to a beautiful array. Similarly, we can check for other permutations too.

In the second example, [0, 0, 4, 4] and [4, 4, 0, 0] are balanced permutations.

In the third example, all permutations are balanced.

assistant: ### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

**1. Compare Line-Level Hit Counts:**
- The `binPow` function (lines 14-23) is called multiple times during the slow input execution, particularly lines 17-21, indicating repeated exponentiation operations.
- The loop for computing factorials (line 41) is executed 100,001 times in the slow run, which is inherently expensive.

**2. Pinpoint Lines or Functions with More Hits:**
- `binPow` function: This function is part of the modular inverse calculation, which is computationally intensive, especially when called multiple times.
- Factorial computation: Line 41 is executed a large number of times, indicating that precomputing factorials for all values up to 100,000 is resource-intensive.

**3. Interaction with Data Structures:**
- The factorial array (`fact`) precomputes factorials up to 100,000, which is necessary for combinatorial calculations in the solution.
- The hit count suggests that the main computational load is in managing permutations and factorial-based operations, especially when determining the number of balanced permutations.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

**1. Natural Language Performance Invariants:**

**Invariant 1: High Exponentiation Load**
- **Description:** "If the function `binPow` is called repeatedly for large values, the computation may become slow due to the intensive modular exponentiation operations."
- **Reasoning:** The function `binPow` is a key contributor to performance degradation as it is hit numerous times for the slow input. This function is used to compute modular inverses, which are necessary when handling permutations and factorials.

**Invariant 2: Extensive Factorial Calculation**
- **Description:** "For arrays with a large number of distinct elements far from the mean, the program may slow down due to extensive precomputation of factorial values and associated combinatorial calculations."
- **Reasoning:** The observed lines indicate that the factorial calculation loop is a major computational burden, especially for inputs requiring permutation operations that involve large differences from the mean.

**Invariant 3: Balance Characteristic Complexity**
- **Description:** "When the array's elements have significant imbalance regarding their mean, leading to many sources and sinks, the program's complexity increases due to the combinatorial nature of balanced permutations."
- **Reasoning:** The combinatorial logic handling sources and sinks (elements above and below the mean) becomes complex, requiring detailed management of factorial and permutation calculations.

**2. Broader Conditions for Slow Execution:**
- These invariants capture the essence of where computations can become costly, focusing on heavy arithmetic operations (like exponentiation) and extensive factorial operations, all underpinned by the logic of balancing permutations.

By understanding these conditions, scenarios where similar patterns arise can be identified, allowing for preemptive performance tuning or optimization strategies to be employed in future cases.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
An array is called beautiful if all the elements in the array are equal.

You can transform an array using the following steps any number of times: 

  1. Choose two indices i and j (1 ≤ i,j ≤ n), and an integer x (1 ≤ x ≤ a_i). Let i be the source index and j be the sink index. 
  2. Decrease the i-th element by x, and increase the j-th element by x. The resulting values at i-th and j-th index are a_i-x and a_j+x respectively. 
  3. The cost of this operation is x ⋅ |j-i| . 
  4. Now the i-th index can no longer be the sink and the j-th index can no longer be the source. 

The total cost of a transformation is the sum of all the costs in step 3.

For example, array [0, 2, 3, 3] can be transformed into a beautiful array [2, 2, 2, 2] with total cost 1 ⋅ |1-3| + 1 ⋅ |1-4| = 5.

An array is called balanced, if it can be transformed into a beautiful array, and the cost of such transformation is uniquely defined. In other words, the minimum cost of transformation into a beautiful array equals the maximum cost.

You are given an array a_1, a_2, …, a_n of length n, consisting of non-negative integers. Your task is to find the number of balanced arrays which are permutations of the given array. Two arrays are considered different, if elements at some position differ. Since the answer can be large, output it modulo 10^9 + 7.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — the size of the array. 

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9).

Output

Output a single integer — the number of balanced permutations modulo 10^9+7.

Note

In the first example, [1, 2, 3] is a valid permutation as we can consider the index with value 3 as the source and index with value 1 as the sink. Thus, after conversion we get a beautiful array [2, 2, 2], and the total cost would be 2. We can show that this is the only transformation of this array that leads to a beautiful array. Similarly, we can check for other permutations too.

In the second example, [0, 0, 4, 4] and [4, 4, 0, 0] are balanced permutations.

In the third example, all permutations are balanced.

assistant: ### Phase 3: Implementing the Invariants in C++

Let's create C++ functions to check each of the performance-characterizing invariants derived in the previous phase.

**Invariant 1: High Exponentiation Load**

```cpp
void check_exponentiation_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to high exponentiation load!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

**Invariant 2: Extensive Factorial Calculation**

```cpp
void check_factorial_calculation_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to excessive factorial calculation!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

**Invariant 3: Balance Characteristic Complexity**

```cpp
void check_balance_complexity_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to complex balance characteristics!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrating the Checkers into the C++ Program

Now, let's integrate these checks into the original C++ code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <numeric>
#include <map>

using namespace std;

#define int long long

typedef long long ll;

const ll MOD = 1e9 + 7;

ll binPow(ll a, ll n)
{
    ll res = 1;
    while (n)
    {
        if (n & 1) res = (res * a) % MOD;
        a = (a * a) % MOD;
        n /= 2;
    }
    return res;
}

void check_exponentiation_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to high exponentiation load!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_factorial_calculation_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to excessive factorial calculation!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_balance_complexity_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to complex balance characteristics!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

signed main()
{
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    vector<int> a(n);
    for (int &i : a) cin >> i;
    ll sum = accumulate(a.begin(), a.end(), 0ll);
    if (sum % n != 0)
    {
        cout << 0;
        return 0;
    }
    sum /= n;
    
    // Check for potential factorial calculation bottleneck
    check_factorial_calculation_invariant(n > 50000); // Adjust threshold accordingly

    vector<ll> fact(1e5 + 1);
    fact[0] = 1;
    for (ll i = 1; i <= 1e5; ++i) fact[i] = (fact[i - 1] * i) % MOD;
    int sources = 0, sinks = 0;
    for (int i : a)
    {
        if (i < sum) ++sinks;
        if (i > sum) ++sources;
    }
    
    // Check for potential balance complexity bottleneck
    check_balance_complexity_invariant(sources > n / 2 && sinks > n / 2); // Adjust conditions to detect complex balances

    ll res = 1;
    if (sinks <= 1 || sources <= 1)
    {
        res = fact[n];
        map<int, int> help;
        for (int i : a) ++help[i];
        for (auto i : help) res = (res * binPow(fact[i.second], MOD - 2)) % MOD;
    }
    else
    {
        res = (((((2 * fact[n]) % MOD) * binPow(fact[sources + sinks], MOD - 2)) % MOD) * binPow(fact[n - sources - sinks], MOD - 2)) % MOD;
        res = (res * fact[sources]) % MOD;
        res = (res * fact[sinks]) % MOD;
        map<int, int> help;
        for (int i : a) if (i != sum) ++help[i];
        for (auto i : help) res = (res * binPow(fact[i.second], MOD - 2)) % MOD;
    }
    
    // Check for potential exponentiation bottleneck
    check_exponentiation_invariant(res > MOD); // A simple condition to illustrate checking during result calculation

    cout << res;
    return 0;
}
```

**Comments on Instrumentation:**
- The checks are placed strategically before major computational burdens or complex logic begins.
- Thresholds are chosen based on logical limits derived from the problem constraints and common performance understanding.
- These checks help identify potential performance bottlenecks during execution without adding substantial overhead.
