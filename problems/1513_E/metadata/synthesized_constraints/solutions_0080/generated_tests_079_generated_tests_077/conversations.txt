system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

An array is called beautiful if all the elements in the array are equal.

You can transform an array using the following steps any number of times: 

  1. Choose two indices i and j (1 ≤ i,j ≤ n), and an integer x (1 ≤ x ≤ a_i). Let i be the source index and j be the sink index. 
  2. Decrease the i-th element by x, and increase the j-th element by x. The resulting values at i-th and j-th index are a_i-x and a_j+x respectively. 
  3. The cost of this operation is x ⋅ |j-i| . 
  4. Now the i-th index can no longer be the sink and the j-th index can no longer be the source. 

The total cost of a transformation is the sum of all the costs in step 3.

For example, array [0, 2, 3, 3] can be transformed into a beautiful array [2, 2, 2, 2] with total cost 1 ⋅ |1-3| + 1 ⋅ |1-4| = 5.

An array is called balanced, if it can be transformed into a beautiful array, and the cost of such transformation is uniquely defined. In other words, the minimum cost of transformation into a beautiful array equals the maximum cost.

You are given an array a_1, a_2, …, a_n of length n, consisting of non-negative integers. Your task is to find the number of balanced arrays which are permutations of the given array. Two arrays are considered different, if elements at some position differ. Since the answer can be large, output it modulo 10^9 + 7.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — the size of the array. 

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9).

Output

Output a single integer — the number of balanced permutations modulo 10^9+7.

Note

In the first example, [1, 2, 3] is a valid permutation as we can consider the index with value 3 as the source and index with value 1 as the sink. Thus, after conversion we get a beautiful array [2, 2, 2], and the total cost would be 2. We can show that this is the only transformation of this array that leads to a beautiful array. Similarly, we can check for other permutations too.

In the second example, [0, 0, 4, 4] and [4, 4, 0, 0] are balanced permutations.

In the third example, all permutations are balanced.

assistant: ### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

Based on the hit count information, we can identify segments of code that contribute to the slowdown for the slow input:

1. **Sorting Function**:
   - The line `sort(s+1,s+1+n);` (line 44) is hit during the slow run but not during the fast run. Sorting can be expensive, especially if the data doesn't require sorting for the fast input.

2. **Initialization with large loops**:
   - The initialization of `mi` and `ma` arrays (lines 46-48) is incredibly hit (200010 times) during the slow run. This suggests potential inefficiency due to perhaps unnecessary initialization, especially since these operations are not hit in the fast input.

3. **Looping through elements for categorization**:
   - The loop starting from line 50 is hit for the slow input but not for fast input, indicating that this loop has operations that only apply when certain conditions in the data are met (e.g., diverse array values).

4. **Power Function**:
   - The `pow` function (lines 34-40) is heavily utilized in the slow run. This could indicate expensive modular arithmetic operations due to large numbers or repeated calculations.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the analysis, here are the performance-characterizing invariants:

1. **Sorting Dependency**:
   - **Invariant**: If the array requires sorting to determine whether it can be transformed into a beautiful array, this sorting operation can be a performance bottleneck. 
   - **Natural Language Description**: "When the input array is not pre-sorted or contains varying large values that require sorting, performance may degrade due to the sorting operation itself."

2. **Large Data Initialization**:
   - **Invariant**: Initializing large arrays for categorization or dynamic data storage can lead to significant overhead.
   - **Natural Language Description**: "If the initialization of large auxiliary arrays is required due to diverse or complex input data, the program may experience slowdowns."

3. **Computation through Large Loops**:
   - **Invariant**: Processing loops that heavily depend on array content can be performance critical.
   - **Natural Language Description**: "When the input has diverse values leading to complex categorization or conditional processing within loops, the execution may become inefficient."

4. **Expensive Modular Arithmetic**:
   - **Invariant**: Repeatedly computing power under modulo with large numbers can bottleneck performance.
   - **Natural Language Description**: "Frequent modular exponentiation with large values can significantly slow down the program when not managed efficiently."

5. **Conditional Path Execution Based on Input Composition**:
   - **Invariant**: The presence of unique or edge-case values in the input array can trigger performance-degrading paths.
   - **Natural Language Description**: "Certain input compositions, specifically those requiring frequent reevaluation of conditions across data points, can lead to slower execution paths." 

These invariants highlight the critical aspects of the code where performance can degrade depending on the input characteristics, especially when dealing with large or diverse datasets.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
An array is called beautiful if all the elements in the array are equal.

You can transform an array using the following steps any number of times: 

  1. Choose two indices i and j (1 ≤ i,j ≤ n), and an integer x (1 ≤ x ≤ a_i). Let i be the source index and j be the sink index. 
  2. Decrease the i-th element by x, and increase the j-th element by x. The resulting values at i-th and j-th index are a_i-x and a_j+x respectively. 
  3. The cost of this operation is x ⋅ |j-i| . 
  4. Now the i-th index can no longer be the sink and the j-th index can no longer be the source. 

The total cost of a transformation is the sum of all the costs in step 3.

For example, array [0, 2, 3, 3] can be transformed into a beautiful array [2, 2, 2, 2] with total cost 1 ⋅ |1-3| + 1 ⋅ |1-4| = 5.

An array is called balanced, if it can be transformed into a beautiful array, and the cost of such transformation is uniquely defined. In other words, the minimum cost of transformation into a beautiful array equals the maximum cost.

You are given an array a_1, a_2, …, a_n of length n, consisting of non-negative integers. Your task is to find the number of balanced arrays which are permutations of the given array. Two arrays are considered different, if elements at some position differ. Since the answer can be large, output it modulo 10^9 + 7.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — the size of the array. 

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9).

Output

Output a single integer — the number of balanced permutations modulo 10^9+7.

Examples

1 2 3


Output


6

Input


4
0 4 0 4


Output


2

Input


5
0 11 12 13 14


Output


120

Note

In the first example, [1, 2, 3] is a valid permutation as we can consider the index with value 3 as the source and index with value 1 as the sink. Thus, after conversion we get a beautiful array [2, 2, 2], and the total cost would be 2. We can show that this is the only transformation of this array that leads to a beautiful array. Similarly, we can check for other permutations too.

In the second example, [0, 0, 4, 4] and [4, 4, 0, 0] are balanced permutations.

In the third example, all permutations are balanced.

assistant: ### Phase 3: Implement Checker Code in C++

For each natural language invariant derived previously, let's implement C++ checker code:

1. **Sorting Dependency Checker**:

   void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
       if (condition) {
           cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - Sorting on large array" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

       if (condition) {
           cerr << "Warning: initialization_invariant triggered - Large auxiliary data initialization" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

   void check_large_loop_invariant(bool condition) {
       if (condition) {
           cerr << "Warning: large_loop_invariant triggered - Complex loop processing on diverse data" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

4. **Expensive Modular Arithmetic Checker**:
   ```cpp
   void check_modular_arithmetic_invariant(bool condition) {
       if (condition) {
           cerr << "Warning: modular_arithmetic_invariant triggered - Expensive repeated calculations" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

   ```cpp
   void check_conditional_path_invariant(bool condition) {
       if (condition) {
           cerr << "Warning: conditional_path_invariant triggered - Execution on complex input composition" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

### Explanation of Integration

- **Sorting Dependency Check**: Added right before sorting, to detect when sorting a large array might become a performance bottleneck.
- **Large Data Initialization Check**: Placed after the initialization of large arrays to catch cases where initialization might slow down the program.
- **Computation through Large Loops Check**: Added after loops that categorize elements to avoid inefficiencies in large loop operations.
- **Conditional Path Execution Check**: Positioned before any processing to catch complex input conditions early.
- **Modular Arithmetic Check**: Implemented within `pow`, although for demonstration purposes, it's commented out since it might require specific conditions to trigger realistically.
