=== Invariants Response ===
Based on the provided information, let's analyze the performance bottlenecks in the given C program and derive performance-characterizing invariants.

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Line-Level Hit Count Analysis**:
    - The slow input results in line 7 (`for (i = 0; i <= 10000; i++)`) being executed 10,002 times and line 8 (`for (j = 0; j <= 10000; j++)`) being executed 100,030,002 times.
    - In contrast, for the fast input, line 7 is executed only twice, and line 8 is executed 10,003 times.
    - Line 9 (`if (((i * a) + (j * b)) == c)`) is a key part of the inner loop, and it is evaluated 100,020,001 times for the slow input but only 10,002 times for the fast input.

2. **Inefficient Loops and Conditions**:
    - The program uses nested loops to check combinations of shots from guns Ebony and Ivory. The slow input causes these loops to iterate significantly more times without finding a solution quickly, indicating that the combinations required to hit the target `c` are not found early in the loop iterations.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the analysis, the following natural language performance invariants can be derived:

1. **High Common Factor Invariant**:
   - Natural Language Description: "If the values of damage per shot from both guns (a and b) are equal or share a high common factor, and the target damage (c) is not a straightforward multiple of either, the program may perform many redundant iterations, significantly slowing down the execution."
   - Explanation: When `a` and `b` are the same or have a common factor, fewer combinations fulfill the condition `(i * a) + (j * b) == c`, leading to more iterations before concluding `No`.

2. **Non-Matching Damage Target Invariant**:
   - Natural Language Description: "If the target damage `c` is not a linear combination of `a` and `b` with small coefficients, the algorithm will iterate through many unproductive combinations, slowing down the process."
   - Explanation: If simpler combinations (small `i` and `j`) cannot achieve `c`, the loops run longer to explore larger and less likely solutions.

3. **Large Target with Small Damage Range Invariant**:
   - Natural Language Description: "If the damage per shot values `a` and `b` are relatively small compared to the target damage `c`, the solution may take longer to find, as more iterations are required to reach larger sums."
   - Explanation: Large targets combined with small individual damages lead to more iterations as the program explores combinations reaching the target.

### Conclusion

By understanding these invariants, the program's performance can be anticipated based on input characteristics. These insights allow us to improve or refine algorithms, potentially replacing the brute-force approach with more efficient methods like using the greatest common divisor (GCD) to check feasibility of reaching the target damage `c`.

=== Checker Response ===
Let's begin with Phase 3, where we implement the performance-characterizing invariants as C++ checker code. We identified three main invariants in the previous analysis:

1. **High Common Factor Invariant**: If `a` and `b` are equal or share a high common factor, and `c` is not a straightforward multiple, many iterations may occur.
2. **Non-Matching Damage Target Invariant**: If `c` is not a linear combination of `a` and `b` with small coefficients, the algorithm may iterate through many combinations.
3. **Large Target with Small Damage Range Invariant**: When `a` and `b` are relatively small compared to `c`, it can lead to many iterations.

### Phase 3: Checker Code in C++

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

// Check if a and b are equal or share a high common factor
void check_high_common_factor_invariant(int a, int b, int c) {
    if (a == b || __gcd(a, b) > min(a, b) / 2) {
        cerr << "Warning: High common factor may cause performance issues!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Check if target c is a linear combination of a and b with small coefficients
void check_non_matching_damage_target_invariant(int a, int b, int c) {
    if (c % a != 0 && c % b != 0 && c > a * 10 && c > b * 10) {
        cerr << "Warning: Non-matching damage target with small coefficients!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Check if the target c is large compared to a and b
void check_large_target_with_small_damage_range_invariant(int a, int b, int c) {
    if (c > a * 50 && c > b * 50) {
        cerr << "Warning: Large target compared to small damage range!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrate Checkers into the Original C++ Code

Now we will integrate the checkers into the original C++ program, placing them effectively after the input is read.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

// Check if a and b are equal or share a high common factor
void check_high_common_factor_invariant(int a, int b, int c) {
    if (a == b || __gcd(a, b) > min(a, b) / 2) {
        cerr << "Warning: High common factor may cause performance issues!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Check if target c is a linear combination of a and b with small coefficients
void check_non_matching_damage_target_invariant(int a, int b, int c) {
    if (c % a != 0 && c % b != 0 && c > a * 10 && c > b * 10) {
        cerr << "Warning: Non-matching damage target with small coefficients!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Check if the target c is large compared to a and b
void check_large_target_with_small_damage_range_invariant(int a, int b, int c) {
    if (c > a * 50 && c > b * 50) {
        cerr << "Warning: Large target compared to small damage range!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    int a, b, c;
    cin >> a >> b >> c;

    // Check for performance bottleneck conditions
    check_high_common_factor_invariant(a, b, c);
    check_non_matching_damage_target_invariant(a, b, c);
    check_large_target_with_small_damage_range_invariant(a, b, c);

    for (int i = 0; i <= 10000; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j <= 10000; j++) {
            if ((i * a) + (j * b) == c) {
                printf("Yes\n");
                return 0;
            }
        }
    }
    printf("No\n");
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

- We placed the checks immediately after reading input values, before entering the heavy loops, to prevent adding overhead within the loops.
- Each invariant check is specific to conditions that lead to performance bottlenecks, and `abort()` is called if any condition is triggered, providing clear feedback during execution.

This instrumented code will help identify slow scenarios effectively during testing or fuzzing by catching specific input patterns that lead to inefficient execution.
