=== Invariants Response ===
To analyze the given C program and derive performance-characterizing invariants, we can follow the steps outlined in the tasks:

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Compare Line-Level Hit Counts**:  
   From the hit count analysis, we see that lines 6, 7, and 8 have significantly higher hit counts for the slow input compared to the fast input. Specifically:
   - Line 6: Initiates the outer loop which runs 10,002 times for slow input vs. 2 times for fast input.
   - Line 7: Initiates the inner loop which runs 100,030,002 times for slow input vs. 10,003 times for fast input.
   - Line 8: Evaluates the condition `a * i + b * j == c` which has an additional multiplication and comparison.

2. **Pinpoint Lines or Functions with More Hits**:  
   The nested loops (lines 6 and 7) and the condition evaluation (line 8) are executed vastly more times in the slow input scenario, indicating inefficiency and leading to increased execution time.

3. **Infer Interaction with Data Structures/Loops**:  
   The costly operations here are due to brute-force checking of combinations of shots fired from each gun to reach the exact damage `c`. This results in a nested loop where both loops iterate up to the value of `c` (10,000), making it potentially inefficient when no quick solution is found.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **Generate Natural Language Statements**:
   - **Invariant 1**: "If both guns deal the same damage per shot (i.e., `a == b`), the program may enter a slow path because all combinations of shots lead to multiples of the same number, making it impossible to meet a specific non-multiple target `c` without additional checks."
   - **Invariant 2**: "If the damage needed (`c`) is a prime number larger than either `a` or `b`, the program could be inefficient since the nested loop would exhaustively search all combinations without finding a solution until the entire loop range is covered."

2. **Avoid Exact Values from Inputs**:
   - While these invariants were inspired by the slow input conditions, they are abstract and applicable to similar cases without relying on specific input values.

3. **Use Thresholds Aligning with Problem Constraints**:
   - The invariants are stated in terms of relationships and properties (like equality and primality), which are independent of the maximum constraints (`a, b <= 100`, `c <= 10,000`).

### Output Requirements

The performance-characterizing invariants reveal conditions under which the C program is likely to slow down:

1. **Invariant 1**: "If both guns deal the same damage per shot, attempts to achieve a non-multiple of this damage value can cause excessive loops without success."
2. **Invariant 2**: "Attempting to achieve a damage total that is a prime number, especially when significantly larger than `a` or `b`, can cause the program to search inefficiently through all possible shot combinations."

These invariants should help future analysis or test case design to uncover potential slow execution scenarios by detecting these patterns in the input parameters.

=== Checker Response ===
### Phase 3: Implement the Natural Language Invariants in C++

Let's translate the performance-characterizing invariants into C++ checker code:

1. **Invariant 1**: If both guns deal the same damage per shot (`a == b`), the combination of any shots will always be a multiple of that damage, making it impossible to hit a non-multiple `c` without further conditions.

```cpp
void check_same_damage_invariant(int a, int b, int c) {
    if (a == b && c % a != 0) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - same damage per shot with non-multiple target." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

2. **Invariant 2**: If `c` is a prime number, especially when larger than `a` and `b`, it can cause inefficient exhaustive search because small combinations won't suffice.

```cpp
bool is_prime(int n) {
    if (n <= 1) return false;
    if (n <= 3) return true;
    if (n % 2 == 0 || n % 3 == 0) return false;
    for (int i = 5; i * i <= n; i += 6) {
        if (n % i == 0 || n % (i + 2) == 0) return false;
    }
    return true;
}

void check_prime_target_invariant(int a, int b, int c) {
    if (is_prime(c) && c > a && c > b) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - prime number target larger than both damage amounts." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrate Invariants into the Original C++ Program

Now, let's integrate these checks into the original C++ code. We'll place these checks appropriately after reading the inputs and before the nested loop starts, so they don't add overhead in tight loops.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Function checking if c is a prime number
bool is_prime(int n) {
    if (n <= 1) return false;
    if (n <= 3) return true;
    if (n % 2 == 0 || n % 3 == 0) return false;
    for (int i = 5; i * i <= n; i += 6) {
        if (n % i == 0 || n % (i + 2) == 0) return false;
    }
    return true;
}

// Checker for invariant 1: Same damage per shot
void check_same_damage_invariant(int a, int b, int c) {
    if (a == b && c % a != 0) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - same damage per shot with non-multiple target." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Checker for invariant 2: Prime target larger than both damages
void check_prime_target_invariant(int a, int b, int c) {
    if (is_prime(c) && c > a && c > b) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - prime number target larger than both damage amounts." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    long long int a, b, c;
    cin >> a >> b >> c;

    // Apply invariant checks after reading inputs
    check_same_damage_invariant(a, b, c);
    check_prime_target_invariant(a, b, c);

    for (int i = 0; i <= 10000; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j <= 10000; j++) {
            if (a * i + b * j == c) {
                cout << "YES" << endl;
                return 0;
            }
        }
    }
    cout << "NO" << endl;
}
```

### Explanation

- **Invariant 1 Check**: This check is added directly after input to catch cases where both guns have the same damage, and the target damage `c` is not a multiple of that damage.
- **Invariant 2 Check**: This check is also added after input to detect when the target damage `c` is a prime number larger than both `a` and `b`, potentially leading to inefficient searches.

By including these checks, the program can immediately warn about potential performance bottlenecks before entering the costly nested loops. This is especially useful for testing and debugging scenarios to quickly identify inputs that may lead to slow execution due to the nature of the problem.
