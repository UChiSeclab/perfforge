system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

Dante is engaged in a fight with "The Savior". Before he can fight it with his sword, he needs to break its shields. He has two guns, Ebony and Ivory, each of them is able to perform any non-negative number of shots.

For every bullet that hits the shield, Ebony deals a units of damage while Ivory deals b units of damage. In order to break the shield Dante has to deal exactly c units of damage. Find out if this is possible.

Input

The first line of the input contains three integers a, b, c (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100, 1 ≤ c ≤ 10 000) — the number of units of damage dealt by Ebony gun and Ivory gun, and the total number of damage required to break the shield, respectively.

Output

Print "Yes" (without quotes) if Dante can deal exactly c damage to the shield and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

(F) Program Solving the Problem Statement

int main() {
  int a, b, c, i, j, count = 0;
  scanf("%d %d %d", &a, &b, &c);
  for (i = 0; i < 10000; i++) {

      if ((a * i + j * b) == c) {
        count++;
        printf("Yes");
        break;
      }

  int a, b, c, i, j, count = 0; /* line 3 slow_hit_count: 1, fast_hit_count: 1 */

  return 0; /* line 16 slow_hit_count: 1, fast_hit_count: 1 */
} /* line 17 slow_hit_count: 0, fast_hit_count: 0 */


assistant: ### Phase 1: Identifying Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Comparing Hit Counts:**  
   - The inner loop at line 6 is executed 100,000,000 times in the slow run compared to 10,002 times in the fast run. 
   - The condition check at line 7 in the inner loop is also executed 100,000,000 times in the slow run but only 10,001 times in the fast run.

2. **Pinpointing Problematic Code:**  
   - The nested loops at lines 5 and 6 are the main contributors to the slowdown, especially since the inner loop is executed a vast number of times without breaking early in the slow input.

3. **Inference on Interaction with Data Structures and Logic:**  
   - The loops iterate over fixed ranges up to 10,000, which is costly. The condition in line 7 fails to break out of the loop early with the slow input due to the specific values of `a`, `b`, and `c`, which do not allow for a straightforward solution early in the loop iterations.

### Phase 2: Deriving Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **Invariant 1: Lack of Early Termination in Nested Loops**  
   - **Natural language statement:** "When the coefficients `a` and `b` are equal or nearly equal, and the required damage `c` is not an integer multiple of `a` or `b`, the nested loop may iterate excessively without finding a solution, leading to significant slowdowns."
   - **Reasoning:** With nearly equal `a` and `b`, potential combinations of shots that hit `c` exactly are limited, causing full loop iterations.

2. **Invariant 2: High Iteration Bounds**  
   - **Natural language statement:** "If the maximum possible iterations (based on constraints) are required to find a solution, the program can slow down significantly, particularly when no other constraints guide early termination."
   - **Reasoning:** The fixed iteration limits (up to 10,000) for both loops mean that in the worst-case scenario, every combination up to this limit is considered, causing slow execution.

### Summary

The performance of the program degrades significantly when:
- The coefficients `a` and `b` are similar or nearly similar, which reduces the diversity of execution paths to satisfy `c`.
- The value of `c` does not allow for an early break from the loops, resulting in fully iterating the loops up to their bounds.
- There is a lack of checks or optimizations to reduce unnecessary iterations, particularly when `a`, `b`, and `c` form a challenging combination. 

Such scenarios result in excessive computation due to the structure of the nested loops and should be addressed by optimizing the loop logic or incorporating mathematical checks before beginning iterative solutions.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
Dante is engaged in a fight with "The Savior". Before he can fight it with his sword, he needs to break its shields. He has two guns, Ebony and Ivory, each of them is able to perform any non-negative number of shots.

For every bullet that hits the shield, Ebony deals a units of damage while Ivory deals b units of damage. In order to break the shield Dante has to deal exactly c units of damage. Find out if this is possible.

Input

The first line of the input contains three integers a, b, c (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100, 1 ≤ c ≤ 10 000) — the number of units of damage dealt by Ebony gun and Ivory gun, and the total number of damage required to break the shield, respectively.

Output

Print "Yes" (without quotes) if Dante can deal exactly c damage to the shield and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

Solution (C++ code):
{solution}


assistant: ### Phase 3: Implementing Natural Language Invariants as C++ Runtime Checks

Based on the invariants we derived, here are the code snippets to check for performance bottlenecks:

1. **Invariant Checker for Nearly Equal Coefficients:**  
   This checks if `a` and `b` are equal or nearly equal, which could lead to excessive iterations.

```cpp
void check_nearly_equal_invariant(int a, int b) {
    if (abs(a - b) <= 1) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - a and b are nearly equal!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

2. **Invariant Checker for High Iteration Bounds:**  
   This checks if the nested loops are likely to iterate completely, which can slow down the program.

```cpp
void check_high_iteration_bounds(int a, int b, int c) {
    if (c > 100 && (c % a != 0 && c % b != 0)) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high iteration bounds!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrating Runtime Checks into the C++ Program

Now we'll integrate these checks into the original program to detect when these performance bottlenecks are likely to be triggered:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Invariant checkers
void check_nearly_equal_invariant(int a, int b) {
    if (abs(a - b) <= 1) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - a and b are nearly equal!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_high_iteration_bounds(int a, int b, int c) {
    if (c > 100 && (c % a != 0 && c % b != 0)) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high iteration bounds!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    int a, b, c, i, j, count = 0;
    scanf("%d %d %d", &a, &b, &c);
    
    // Check for nearly equal coefficients
    check_nearly_equal_invariant(a, b);
    // Check for high iteration bounds
    check_high_iteration_bounds(a, b, c);
    
    for (i = 0; i < 10000; i++) {
        for (j = 0; j < 10000; j++) {
            if ((a * i + j * b) == c) {
                count++;
                printf("Yes");
                break;
            }
        }
        if (count > 0) break;
    }
    if (count == 0) printf("No");
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:

- **`check_nearly_equal_invariant`:** This function checks if the values of `a` and `b` are equal or differ by at most 1. If so, it aborts the program, warning of a potential performance bottleneck due to high iteration counts for such cases.

- **`check_high_iteration_bounds`:** This function checks if `c` is relatively large and not a direct multiple of `a` or `b`, potentially indicating a situation where many iteration attempts are needed to find a solution. If the condition is true, it aborts the program.

These checks are placed right after input reading as they analyze the input parameters before entering the loops, ensuring they do not add overhead within the performance-critical loops.
