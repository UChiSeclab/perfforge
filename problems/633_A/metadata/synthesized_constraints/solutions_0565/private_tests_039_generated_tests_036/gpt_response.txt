### Phase 1: Identifying Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Comparing Hit Counts:**  
   - The inner loop at line 6 is executed 100,000,000 times in the slow run compared to 10,002 times in the fast run. 
   - The condition check at line 7 in the inner loop is also executed 100,000,000 times in the slow run but only 10,001 times in the fast run.

2. **Pinpointing Problematic Code:**  
   - The nested loops at lines 5 and 6 are the main contributors to the slowdown, especially since the inner loop is executed a vast number of times without breaking early in the slow input.

3. **Inference on Interaction with Data Structures and Logic:**  
   - The loops iterate over fixed ranges up to 10,000, which is costly. The condition in line 7 fails to break out of the loop early with the slow input due to the specific values of `a`, `b`, and `c`, which do not allow for a straightforward solution early in the loop iterations.

### Phase 2: Deriving Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **Invariant 1: Lack of Early Termination in Nested Loops**  
   - **Natural language statement:** "When the coefficients `a` and `b` are equal or nearly equal, and the required damage `c` is not an integer multiple of `a` or `b`, the nested loop may iterate excessively without finding a solution, leading to significant slowdowns."
   - **Reasoning:** With nearly equal `a` and `b`, potential combinations of shots that hit `c` exactly are limited, causing full loop iterations.

2. **Invariant 2: High Iteration Bounds**  
   - **Natural language statement:** "If the maximum possible iterations (based on constraints) are required to find a solution, the program can slow down significantly, particularly when no other constraints guide early termination."
   - **Reasoning:** The fixed iteration limits (up to 10,000) for both loops mean that in the worst-case scenario, every combination up to this limit is considered, causing slow execution.

### Summary

The performance of the program degrades significantly when:
- The coefficients `a` and `b` are similar or nearly similar, which reduces the diversity of execution paths to satisfy `c`.
- The value of `c` does not allow for an early break from the loops, resulting in fully iterating the loops up to their bounds.
- There is a lack of checks or optimizations to reduce unnecessary iterations, particularly when `a`, `b`, and `c` form a challenging combination. 

Such scenarios result in excessive computation due to the structure of the nested loops and should be addressed by optimizing the loop logic or incorporating mathematical checks before beginning iterative solutions.

### Phase 3: Implementing Natural Language Invariants as C++ Runtime Checks

Based on the invariants we derived, here are the code snippets to check for performance bottlenecks:

1. **Invariant Checker for Nearly Equal Coefficients:**  
   This checks if `a` and `b` are equal or nearly equal, which could lead to excessive iterations.

```cpp
void check_nearly_equal_invariant(int a, int b) {
    if (abs(a - b) <= 1) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - a and b are nearly equal!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

2. **Invariant Checker for High Iteration Bounds:**  
   This checks if the nested loops are likely to iterate completely, which can slow down the program.

```cpp
void check_high_iteration_bounds(int a, int b, int c) {
    if (c > 100 && (c % a != 0 && c % b != 0)) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high iteration bounds!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrating Runtime Checks into the C++ Program

Now we'll integrate these checks into the original program to detect when these performance bottlenecks are likely to be triggered:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Invariant checkers
void check_nearly_equal_invariant(int a, int b) {
    if (abs(a - b) <= 1) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - a and b are nearly equal!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_high_iteration_bounds(int a, int b, int c) {
    if (c > 100 && (c % a != 0 && c % b != 0)) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high iteration bounds!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    int a, b, c, i, j, count = 0;
    scanf("%d %d %d", &a, &b, &c);
    
    // Check for nearly equal coefficients
    check_nearly_equal_invariant(a, b);
    // Check for high iteration bounds
    check_high_iteration_bounds(a, b, c);
    
    for (i = 0; i < 10000; i++) {
        for (j = 0; j < 10000; j++) {
            if ((a * i + j * b) == c) {
                count++;
                printf("Yes");
                break;
            }
        }
        if (count > 0) break;
    }
    if (count == 0) printf("No");
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:

- **`check_nearly_equal_invariant`:** This function checks if the values of `a` and `b` are equal or differ by at most 1. If so, it aborts the program, warning of a potential performance bottleneck due to high iteration counts for such cases.

- **`check_high_iteration_bounds`:** This function checks if `c` is relatively large and not a direct multiple of `a` or `b`, potentially indicating a situation where many iteration attempts are needed to find a solution. If the condition is true, it aborts the program.

These checks are placed right after input reading as they analyze the input parameters before entering the loops, ensuring they do not add overhead within the performance-critical loops.
