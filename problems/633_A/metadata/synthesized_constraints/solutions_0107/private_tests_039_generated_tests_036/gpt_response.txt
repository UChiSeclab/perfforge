=== Invariants Response ===
To diagnose the performance bottleneck in this C program, we need to analyze and compare the hit counts for both the fast and slow inputs. The program uses nested loops to determine if certain combinations of shots from two guns, Ebony and Ivory, can achieve exactly `c` units of damage.

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Hit Count Analysis:**
   - **Slow Input (6 6 7):**
     - The outer loop (line 7) iterates 10,002 times.
     - The inner loop (line 8) iterates 10,003,0002 times.
     - The condition check `(i * a + j * b) == c` (line 9) is evaluated 100,020,001 times.

   - **Fast Input (7 6 7):**
     - The outer loop (line 7) iterates 3 times.
     - The inner loop (line 8) iterates 10,004 times.
     - The condition check `(i * a + j * b) == c` (line 9) is evaluated 10,002 times.

2. **Observation:**
   - The inner loop and condition check execute excessively when neither `a` nor `b` is a divisor of `c`, leading to unnecessary iterations.
   - Specifically, the slow input causes the code to execute the inner loop condition over 100 million times before concluding no solution exists.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **Invariant 1: Divisibility and GCD Check**
   - **Natural Language Description:** 
     "The computation becomes inefficient when both `a` and `b` are not divisors of `c` and have a common divisor greater than 1. Checking the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` against `c` can preemptively determine if a solution is impossible, reducing unnecessary iterations."
   - **Threshold:**
     - When `gcd(a, b) > 1` and `c` is not divisible by `gcd(a, b)`, the problem is unsolvable without iterating.

2. **Invariant 2: Early Exit for Direct Multipliers**
   - **Natural Language Description:**
     "If either `a` or `b` is a direct multiplier of `c`, the loops can terminate early, as a solution is easily ascertainable."
   - **Threshold:**
     - When `c % a == 0` or `c % b == 0` holds true, the problem can be solved directly without further loop iterations.

3. **Invariant 3: Iteration Limits**
   - **Natural Language Description:**
     "The double loop structure iterates over a large possible range of values for `i` and `j`, leading to performance issues when the required damage `c` is relatively small compared to potential combinations."
   - **Threshold:**
     - Limit iterations by checking if `i` and `j` combinations can realistically meet `c` given small values relative to `a` and `b`.

By applying these invariants, we can optimize the program to avoid excessive looping and reduce computation time, making it more efficient for inputs like the slow case described.

### Phase 3: Implementing Performance-Characterizing Invariants in C++

Here, we translate the natural language invariants into C++ code snippets that can be integrated into the original program to check for performance bottlenecks.

1. **Invariant 1: Divisibility and GCD Check**
   ```cpp
   #include <iostream>
   #include <cstdlib> // for abort
   #include <numeric> // for gcd

   void check_gcd_invariant(int a, int b, int c) {
       int gcd_ab = std::gcd(a, b);
       if (gcd_ab > 1 && c % gcd_ab != 0) {
           std::cerr << "Warning: GCD invariant triggered - solution impossible without unnecessary iterations" << std::endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Invariant 2: Early Exit for Direct Multipliers**
   ```cpp
   void check_multiplier_invariant(int a, int b, int c) {
       if (c % a == 0 || c % b == 0) {
           std::cerr << "Warning: Multiplier invariant triggered - direct solution available" << std::endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Invariant 3: Iteration Limits**
   - This invariant isn't directly applicable with a useful runtime check without knowing the context of the loops. The check will be integrated in the code and adjusted for the logic.

### Phase 4: Integrating Checks into the Original Program

Now, we integrate these checks into the original program to detect conditions where a performance bottleneck might occur.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

#include <cstdlib> // for abort
#include <numeric> // for gcd

void check_gcd_invariant(int a, int b, int c) {
    int gcd_ab = std::gcd(a, b);
    if (gcd_ab > 1 && c % gcd_ab != 0) {
        cerr << "Warning: GCD invariant triggered - solution impossible without unnecessary iterations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_multiplier_invariant(int a, int b, int c) {
    if (c % a == 0 || c % b == 0) {
        cerr << "Warning: Multiplier invariant triggered - direct solution available" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    int a, b, c, i, j;
    cin >> a >> b >> c;

    // Checker for potential performance bottlenecks
    check_gcd_invariant(a, b, c);
    check_multiplier_invariant(a, b, c);

    bool flag = true;
    for (i = 0; i <= 10000 && flag == true; i++) {
        for (j = 0; j <= 10000 && flag == true; j++) {
            if ((i * a + j * b) == c) {
                cout << "Yes" << endl;
                flag = false;
            }
        }
    }
    if (flag == true) cout << "No" << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

- **GCD Invariant Check:** This check is added before starting the main loop to abort execution if the combination of `a`, `b`, and `c` makes a solution impossible due to the GCD condition.
  
- **Multiplier Invariant Check:** This is another early check that can abort execution if `c` is directly reachable by multiplying `a` or `b` without needing to iterate through combinations.

These checks are placed strategically before the loops to prevent excessive iterations in situations where the outcome can be determined by simpler arithmetic checks.
