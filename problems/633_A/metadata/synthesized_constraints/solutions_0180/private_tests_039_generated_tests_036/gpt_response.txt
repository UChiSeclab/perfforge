## Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

Upon examining the hit counts for both the slow and fast inputs, the following patterns emerge:

1. **Infinite Loop Structure:**
   - Lines 17 and 18 (the two nested `for` loops) have extremely high hit counts for the slow input (`10011` and `100210110` respectively) and zero for the fast input. This suggests that the loops are executing an excessive number of times for the slow input.
   - The outer loop runs up to `10010` times, and for each iteration, the inner loop also runs up to `10010` times, leading to a potential total of `10010 * 10010` iterations, which is computationally expensive.

2. **Accumulation and Conditional Check:**
   - Lines 19 and 23, which calculate `cur + cur_b` and update `cur_b` respectively, are executed `100200100` times. This highlights that the condition `(cur + cur_b) == c` is checked repeatedly without breaking early for the slow input.

3. **Absence of Early Termination:**
   - Unlike the fast input, the slow input lacks an early termination path and continues to iterate through the entire nested loop structure, indicating that the condition `(cur + cur_b) == c` is not meeting a successful outcome early enough.

## Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the analysis above, we can derive the following performance invariants that characterize conditions under which the program may slow down:

1. **Inadequate Progress in Accumulation:**
   - Natural Language Description: "If the values `a` and `b` share a common divisor with `c`, and neither `a` nor `b` individually equals `c`, the nested loop may run excessively as the condition `(cur + cur_b) == c` will seldom be met without significant iteration."
   - Explanation: This invariant captures situations where `a` and `b` do not contribute effectively to accumulate to `c`, causing excessive looping.

2. **Potential for Non-Termination:**
   - Natural Language Description: "If the gcd of `a` and `b` does not evenly divide `c`, then the combination of shots required to achieve exactly `c` damage might not exist, causing the loops to potentially iterate to their maximum bounds without finding a solution."
   - Explanation: This emphasizes the mathematical underpinning that if `c` cannot be expressed as a linear combination of `a` and `b`, the loops will iterate fully.

3. **High Iterative Overhead:**
   - Natural Language Description: "When `a` and `b` are both small relative to `c`, the number of iterations required to explore all combinations increases substantially, potentially leading to performance degradation."
   - Explanation: Larger values for `c` relative to `a` and `b` necessitate more combinations to be checked, especially when the loop limits are large.

These invariants identify key conditions under which the program runs slowly, helping guide any future optimizations or modifications to the code to avoid such performance pitfalls under similar inputs.

## Phase 3: Implement the Natural Language Invariants in C++

Below, I translate the performance-characterizing invariants from natural language into C++ code snippets. Each snippet checks a condition that could lead to a performance bottleneck.

### Invariant 1: Inadequate Progress in Accumulation
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm> // for std::gcd

void check_common_divisor_invariant(int a, int b, int c) {
    if (std::gcd(a, b) % c != 0 && a != c && b != c) {
        std::cerr << "Warning: Potential infinite loop due to common divisor invariant!" << std::endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Invariant 2: Potential for Non-Termination
```cpp
void check_gcd_divisor_invariant(int a, int b, int c) {
    if (c % std::gcd(a, b) != 0) {
        std::cerr << "Warning: No solution possible due to GCD not dividing c!" << std::endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Invariant 3: High Iterative Overhead
```cpp
void check_iterative_overhead_invariant(int a, int b, int c) {
    if (a < c / 100 && b < c / 100) { // Arbitrary threshold for small a and b relative to c
        std::cerr << "Warning: High number of iterations due to small a and b relative to c!" << std::endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

## Phase 4: Integrate Checker Code with the Original Program

Now, I will integrate these invariants into the provided C++ code to create runtime checks that can help detect performance bottlenecks.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Function to check for common divisor invariant
void check_common_divisor_invariant(int a, int b, int c) {
    if (std::gcd(a, b) % c != 0 && a != c && b != c) {
        cerr << "Warning: Potential infinite loop due to common divisor invariant!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Function to check for gcd divisor invariant
void check_gcd_divisor_invariant(int a, int b, int c) {
    if (c % std::gcd(a, b) != 0) {
        cerr << "Warning: No solution possible due to GCD not dividing c!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Function to check for iterative overhead invariant
void check_iterative_overhead_invariant(int a, int b, int c) {
    if (a < c / 100 && b < c / 100) {
        cerr << "Warning: High number of iterations due to small a and b relative to c!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    int a, b, c;
    cin >> a >> b >> c;

    // Check performance invariants before starting heavy computation
    check_common_divisor_invariant(a, b, c);
    check_gcd_divisor_invariant(a, b, c);
    check_iterative_overhead_invariant(a, b, c);

    if (a == c || b == c) {
        cout << "YES" << endl;
        return 0;
    }
    if (a > c && b > c) {
        cout << "NO" << endl;
        return 0;
    }
    int cur = 0;
    int cur_b = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < 10010; i++) {
        for (int i = 0; i < 10010; i++) {
            if ((cur + cur_b) == c) {
                cout << "YES" << endl;
                return 0;
            }
            cur_b += b;
        }
        cur_b = 0;
        cur += a;
    }
    cout << "NO" << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of Integration:
- The invariant checks are placed immediately after reading the input to ensure they run before any potentially expensive operations.
- Each check is given a descriptive warning message to indicate which performance bottleneck condition was triggered.
- The `abort()` function is used to terminate the program if a check fails, which assists in debugging and prevents the program from running inefficiently.
