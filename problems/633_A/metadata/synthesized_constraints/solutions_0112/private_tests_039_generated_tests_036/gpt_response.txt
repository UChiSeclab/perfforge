=== Invariants Response ===
To analyze the provided C program and derive performance-characterizing invariants, follow the two-phase analysis as outlined:

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Compare Line-Level Hit Counts:**
   - **Slow Input:**
     - Line 8: `for (int(i) = (0); (i) <= (10000); (i)++)` - **10002 hits**
     - Line 9: `for (int(j) = (0); (j) <= (10000); (j)++)` - **100030002 hits**
     - Line 10: `if (a * i + b * j == c)` - **100020001 hits**
   - **Fast Input:**
     - Line 8: **2 hits**
     - Line 9: **10003 hits**
     - Line 10: **10002 hits**

2. **Pinpoint Inefficient Lines and Functions:**
   - The nested loops (lines 8 and 9) are responsible for the heavy computation, especially under the slow input scenario where each iteration of `i` results in a full traversal of `j`.

3. **Infer Interaction with Data Structures and Input Constraints:**
   - The loops iterate over all combinations of `i` and `j` such that `0 <= i, j <= 10000`, checking if `a*i + b*j == c`. This results in `10001 * 10001` iterations in the worst case.
   - When `a` and `b` are the same or nearly the same (as in the slow input), it's less likely to find an `i, j` combination quickly, causing the loops to run through more iterations.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **Conditions for Slow Path Entry:**
   - **Invariant 1:** "If both damage values `a` and `b` are equal or nearly equal and the required damage `c` is not a straightforward multiple of either, the algorithm may enter a slow path due to exhaustive search."
   - **Invariant 2:** "When `c` is a small number relative to `a` and `b`, and neither `a` nor `b` divides `c` exactly, the exhaustive search may cause a slowdown."
   - **Invariant 3:** "If no early termination condition is met (i.e., `a*i + b*j == c` is not satisfied early in the loops), the program might evaluate all possible combinations, leading to performance degradation."

2. **Thresholds and Correlations:**
   - The main performance issue arises when the loops iterate over a maximum possible range due to lack of early satisfaction of the condition `a*i + b*j == c`. This can be more pronounced when `a` and `b` are similar or when `c` does not lend itself to easy factorization by `a` and `b`.

3. **Broad Statements for Future Scenarios:**
   - **Invariant 4:** "The program's performance is contingent on the ability to quickly find a combination of shots that matches `c`. When this is unlikely due to the input values' relationships, performance suffers due to the full exploration of the problem space up to the maximum bounds."

These invariants abstract the conditions leading to the slowdown and can help guide future optimizations or debugging efforts by providing insights into how the input values interact with the algorithm structure.

=== Checker Response ===
### Phase 3: Implementing Checker Code in C++

Based on the previously derived natural language performance-characterizing invariants, here are the C++ code snippets to implement them as runtime checks:

1. **Invariant for Equal or Nearly Equal Damage Values:**
   ```cpp
   void check_equal_damage_invariant(int a, int b) {
       if (a == b) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered! Equal damage values." << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Invariant for Small `c` Relative to `a` and `b`:**
   ```cpp
   void check_small_c_invariant(int a, int b, int c) {
       if (c < a && c < b) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered! Small c relative to a and b." << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Invariant for Exhaustive Search:**
   ```cpp
   void check_exhaustive_search_invariant(int a, int b, int c) {
       if ((a <= 10 && b <= 10 && c >= 100) || (c % a != 0 && c % b != 0)) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered! Exhaustive search likely." << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Integrating Checker Code with the Original Program

Now, let's integrate these checker functions into the original C++ code. The checkers will be invoked after reading the input values to avoid adding overhead in the nested loops.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Checker for equal damage values
void check_equal_damage_invariant(int a, int b) {
    if (a == b) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered! Equal damage values." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Checker for small c relative to a and b
void check_small_c_invariant(int a, int b, int c) {
    if (c < a && c < b) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered! Small c relative to a and b." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Checker for situations likely to cause exhaustive search
void check_exhaustive_search_invariant(int a, int b, int c) {
    if ((a <= 10 && b <= 10 && c >= 100) || (c % a != 0 && c % b != 0)) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered! Exhaustive search likely." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    int a, b, c;
    scanf("%d%d%d", &a, &b, &c);

    // Run the performance checkers
    check_equal_damage_invariant(a, b);
    check_small_c_invariant(a, b, c);
    check_exhaustive_search_invariant(a, b, c);

    for (int i = 0; i <= 10000; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j <= 10000; j++) {
            if (a * i + b * j == c) {
                printf("Yes\n");
                return 0;
            }
        }
    }
    printf("No\n");
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation
- **Checkers are placed right after the input is read** to immediately act on conditions that might lead to slow execution.
- **Each checker targets a specific performance invariant**, helping to identify when the conditions for a slowdown are met.
- **`abort()` is used to halt execution if a bottleneck condition is triggered**, aiding in debugging and guiding test cases or fuzzing tools to uncover performance issues.
