system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

Dante is engaged in a fight with "The Savior". Before he can fight it with his sword, he needs to break its shields. He has two guns, Ebony and Ivory, each of them is able to perform any non-negative number of shots.

For every bullet that hits the shield, Ebony deals a units of damage while Ivory deals b units of damage. In order to break the shield Dante has to deal exactly c units of damage. Find out if this is possible.

Input

The first line of the input contains three integers a, b, c (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100, 1 ≤ c ≤ 10 000) — the number of units of damage dealt by Ebony gun and Ivory gun, and the total number of damage required to break the shield, respectively.

Output

Print "Yes" (without quotes) if Dante can deal exactly c damage to the shield and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

} /* line 17 slow_hit_count: 0, fast_hit_count: 0 */


assistant: To analyze the provided C program and derive performance-characterizing invariants, follow the two-phase analysis as outlined:

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Compare Line-Level Hit Counts:**
   - **Slow Input:**
     - Line 8: `for (int(i) = (0); (i) <= (10000); (i)++)` - **10002 hits**
     - Line 9: `for (int(j) = (0); (j) <= (10000); (j)++)` - **100030002 hits**
     - Line 10: `if (a * i + b * j == c)` - **100020001 hits**
   - **Fast Input:**
     - Line 8: **2 hits**
     - Line 9: **10003 hits**
     - Line 10: **10002 hits**

2. **Pinpoint Inefficient Lines and Functions:**
   - The nested loops (lines 8 and 9) are responsible for the heavy computation, especially under the slow input scenario where each iteration of `i` results in a full traversal of `j`.

3. **Infer Interaction with Data Structures and Input Constraints:**
   - The loops iterate over all combinations of `i` and `j` such that `0 <= i, j <= 10000`, checking if `a*i + b*j == c`. This results in `10001 * 10001` iterations in the worst case.
   - When `a` and `b` are the same or nearly the same (as in the slow input), it's less likely to find an `i, j` combination quickly, causing the loops to run through more iterations.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **Conditions for Slow Path Entry:**
   - **Invariant 1:** "If both damage values `a` and `b` are equal or nearly equal and the required damage `c` is not a straightforward multiple of either, the algorithm may enter a slow path due to exhaustive search."
   - **Invariant 2:** "When `c` is a small number relative to `a` and `b`, and neither `a` nor `b` divides `c` exactly, the exhaustive search may cause a slowdown."
   - **Invariant 3:** "If no early termination condition is met (i.e., `a*i + b*j == c` is not satisfied early in the loops), the program might evaluate all possible combinations, leading to performance degradation."

2. **Thresholds and Correlations:**
   - The main performance issue arises when the loops iterate over a maximum possible range due to lack of early satisfaction of the condition `a*i + b*j == c`. This can be more pronounced when `a` and `b` are similar or when `c` does not lend itself to easy factorization by `a` and `b`.

3. **Broad Statements for Future Scenarios:**
   - **Invariant 4:** "The program's performance is contingent on the ability to quickly find a combination of shots that matches `c`. When this is unlikely due to the input values' relationships, performance suffers due to the full exploration of the problem space up to the maximum bounds."

These invariants abstract the conditions leading to the slowdown and can help guide future optimizations or debugging efforts by providing insights into how the input values interact with the algorithm structure.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
Dante is engaged in a fight with "The Savior". Before he can fight it with his sword, he needs to break its shields. He has two guns, Ebony and Ivory, each of them is able to perform any non-negative number of shots.

For every bullet that hits the shield, Ebony deals a units of damage while Ivory deals b units of damage. In order to break the shield Dante has to deal exactly c units of damage. Find out if this is possible.

Input

The first line of the input contains three integers a, b, c (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100, 1 ≤ c ≤ 10 000) — the number of units of damage dealt by Ebony gun and Ivory gun, and the total number of damage required to break the shield, respectively.

Output

Print "Yes" (without quotes) if Dante can deal exactly c damage to the shield and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

Solution (C++ code):
{solution}


assistant: ### Phase 3: Implementing Checker Code in C++

Based on the previously derived natural language performance-characterizing invariants, here are the C++ code snippets to implement them as runtime checks:

1. **Invariant for Equal or Nearly Equal Damage Values:**
   ```cpp
   void check_equal_damage_invariant(int a, int b) {
       if (a == b) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered! Equal damage values." << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Invariant for Small `c` Relative to `a` and `b`:**
   ```cpp
   void check_small_c_invariant(int a, int b, int c) {
       if (c < a && c < b) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered! Small c relative to a and b." << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Invariant for Exhaustive Search:**
   ```cpp
   void check_exhaustive_search_invariant(int a, int b, int c) {
       if ((a <= 10 && b <= 10 && c >= 100) || (c % a != 0 && c % b != 0)) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered! Exhaustive search likely." << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Integrating Checker Code with the Original Program

Now, let's integrate these checker functions into the original C++ code. The checkers will be invoked after reading the input values to avoid adding overhead in the nested loops.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Checker for equal damage values
void check_equal_damage_invariant(int a, int b) {
    if (a == b) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered! Equal damage values." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Checker for small c relative to a and b
void check_small_c_invariant(int a, int b, int c) {
    if (c < a && c < b) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered! Small c relative to a and b." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Checker for situations likely to cause exhaustive search
void check_exhaustive_search_invariant(int a, int b, int c) {
    if ((a <= 10 && b <= 10 && c >= 100) || (c % a != 0 && c % b != 0)) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered! Exhaustive search likely." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    int a, b, c;
    scanf("%d%d%d", &a, &b, &c);

    // Run the performance checkers
    check_equal_damage_invariant(a, b);
    check_small_c_invariant(a, b, c);
    check_exhaustive_search_invariant(a, b, c);

    for (int i = 0; i <= 10000; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j <= 10000; j++) {
            if (a * i + b * j == c) {
                printf("Yes\n");
                return 0;
            }
        }
    }
    printf("No\n");
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation
- **Checkers are placed right after the input is read** to immediately act on conditions that might lead to slow execution.
- **Each checker targets a specific performance invariant**, helping to identify when the conditions for a slowdown are met.
- **`abort()` is used to halt execution if a bottleneck condition is triggered**, aiding in debugging and guiding test cases or fuzzing tools to uncover performance issues.
