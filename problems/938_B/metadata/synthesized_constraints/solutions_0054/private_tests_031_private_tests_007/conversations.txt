system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

You and your friend are participating in a TV show "Run For Your Prize".

At the start of the show n prizes are located on a straight line. i-th prize is located at position ai. Positions of all prizes are distinct. You start at position 1, your friend — at position 106 (and there is no prize in any of these two positions). You have to work as a team and collect all prizes in minimum possible time, in any order.

You know that it takes exactly 1 second to move from position x to position x + 1 or x - 1, both for you and your friend. You also have trained enough to instantly pick up any prize, if its position is equal to your current position (and the same is true for your friend). Carrying prizes does not affect your speed (or your friend's speed) at all.

Now you may discuss your strategy with your friend and decide who will pick up each prize. Remember that every prize must be picked up, either by you or by your friend.

What is the minimum number of seconds it will take to pick up all the prizes?

Input

The first line contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of prizes.

The second line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an (2 ≤ ai ≤ 106 - 1) — the positions of the prizes. No two prizes are located at the same position. Positions are given in ascending order.

Output

Print one integer — the minimum number of seconds it will take to collect all prizes.

Examples

Input

3
2 3 9


Output

8


Input

2
2 999995


Output

5

Note

In the first example you take all the prizes: take the first at 1, the second at 2 and the third at 8.

In the second example you take the first prize in 1 second and your friend takes the other in 5 seconds, you do this simultaneously, so the total time is 5.

assistant: To determine the performance bottlenecks in the provided C program, we need to analyze the program's behavior with both the fast and slow inputs, taking into account the hit counts for each line of code.

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Compare line-level hit counts:**
   - For the fast input, lines 14 to 20 are executed exactly once.
   - For the slow input, lines 14 to 20 are executed 499,998 times (for lines 14-17) and 499,997 times (for lines 18-20).

2. **Pinpoint lines that get significantly more hits under the slow input:**
   - The loop from lines 14 to 20 is executed an extraordinarily large number of times for the slow input compared to the fast input. This indicates that the program performs a high number of operations when the distance between prizes is large and they are spread far apart, as in positions 499,999 and 999,999 for the slow input.

3. **Infer interaction with data structures and loops:**
   - The loop is iterating over the entire range between `s1` and `e1`, incrementing `s1` and decrementing `e1` step by step, checking for prizes at each position. This direct and linear traversal becomes costly when prizes are far apart, as `s1` and `e1` must converge from positions 1 and 1,000,000, respectively.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **Generate natural language statements describing conditions for slow paths:**

   - **Invariant 1: Large Distance Between Prizes**
     - Natural Language: "When prizes are positioned such that they are widely spread across the line, specifically when the nearest and farthest prizes from the starting positions of both participants are far apart, the program may slow down significantly."
     - This is because the loop must traverse a large range to collect all prizes, resulting in a high iteration count.

   - **Invariant 2: Sparse Distribution of Prizes**
     - Natural Language: "If the distribution of prizes is sparse and concentrated near the middle segment of the path, the program may become slower, as both participants need to travel longer distances to collect them."
     - This results in a scenario where participants have to converge from their initial positions with little overlap, leading to longer execution times.

2. **Suggest threshold values aligned with problem constraints (e.g., n ≤ 100,000):**
   - Given the constraint where `n` can be as large as 100,000, a critical slowdown occurs when the total range that needs to be traversed approaches the maximum possible distance between the starting positions and the farthest prize position, which could be close to 1,000,000.

### Conclusion

The primary performance bottleneck in the program arises when prizes are distributed such that significant distances need to be traveled by the participants to collect them. The nested loop iteratively checks each position between `s1` and `e1`, which can be very inefficient for large gaps between prizes. Therefore, the invariants focus on the distribution and placement of prizes along the line, emphasizing the impact of large traversing distances on execution time.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
You and your friend are participating in a TV show "Run For Your Prize".

At the start of the show n prizes are located on a straight line. i-th prize is located at position ai. Positions of all prizes are distinct. You start at position 1, your friend — at position 106 (and there is no prize in any of these two positions). You have to work as a team and collect all prizes in minimum possible time, in any order.

You know that it takes exactly 1 second to move from position x to position x + 1 or x - 1, both for you and your friend. You also have trained enough to instantly pick up any prize, if its position is equal to your current position (and the same is true for your friend). Carrying prizes does not affect your speed (or your friend's speed) at all.

Now you may discuss your strategy with your friend and decide who will pick up each prize. Remember that every prize must be picked up, either by you or by your friend.

What is the minimum number of seconds it will take to pick up all the prizes?

Input

The first line contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of prizes.

The second line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an (2 ≤ ai ≤ 106 - 1) — the positions of the prizes. No two prizes are located at the same position. Positions are given in ascending order.

Output

Print one integer — the minimum number of seconds it will take to collect all prizes.

Examples

Input

3
2 3 9


Output

8


Input

2
2 999995


Output

Note

In the first example you take all the prizes: take the first at 1, the second at 2 and the third at 8.

In the second example you take the first prize in 1 second and your friend takes the other in 5 seconds, you do this simultaneously, so the total time is 5.

Solution (C++ code):
{solution}


assistant: ### Phase 3: Implementing Invariants as C++ Checkers

Based on the natural language invariants derived in Phase 2, here's how you can implement the checks in C++:

1. **Invariant 1: Large Distance Between Prizes**

   - **Natural Language:** "When prizes are positioned such that they are widely spread across the line, specifically when the nearest and farthest prizes from the starting positions of both participants are far apart, the program may slow down significantly."

   ```cpp
   void check_large_distance_invariant(long long first_prize, long long last_prize) {
       if ((last_prize - first_prize) > 500000) { // Assuming a large threshold for distance
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to large distance between prizes!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Invariant 2: Sparse Distribution of Prizes**

   - **Natural Language:** "If the distribution of prizes is sparse and concentrated near the middle segment of the path, the program may become slower, as both participants need to travel longer distances to collect them."

   ```cpp
   void check_sparse_distribution_invariant(long long first_prize, long long last_prize, long long n) {
       if (n < 10 && (last_prize - first_prize) > 500000) { // Assuming sparsity implies fewer than 10 prizes over a large distance
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to sparse prize distribution!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Integrating Checkers into the Original C++ Program

The following modified C++ code integrates these checkers into the original solution:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Check for large distance between the first and last prize
void check_large_distance_invariant(long long first_prize, long long last_prize) {
    if ((last_prize - first_prize) > 500000) { // Assuming a large threshold for distance
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to large distance between prizes!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Check for sparse distribution of prizes
void check_sparse_distribution_invariant(long long first_prize, long long last_prize, long long n) {
    if (n < 10 && (last_prize - first_prize) > 500000) { // Assuming sparsity implies fewer than 10 prizes over a large distance
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to sparse prize distribution!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    long long n;
    cin >> n;
    vector<long long> prizes(n);
    for (long long i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        cin >> prizes[i];
    }

    // Insert checks after reading input
    check_large_distance_invariant(prizes.front(), prizes.back());
    check_sparse_distribution_invariant(prizes.front(), prizes.back(), n);

    // Original program logic
    long long s1 = 1, e1 = 1000000, cnt = 0, ans = 0;
    while (1) {
        ans++;
        s1++;
        if (binary_search(prizes.begin(), prizes.end(), s1)) cnt++;
        if (cnt == n || s1 == e1 - 1) break;
        e1--;
        if (binary_search(prizes.begin(), prizes.end(), e1)) cnt++;
        if (cnt == n || s1 == e1 - 1) break;
    }
    cout << ans << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

- **Checker Functions:** 
  - `check_large_distance_invariant` checks if the prizes are distributed over a large distance, leading to potential slowdowns.
  - `check_sparse_distribution_invariant` checks if the prizes are sparsely distributed across a large range.

- **Integration Points:**
  - These checks are called immediately after reading the input, ensuring that any potential performance issues are caught before running the costly loop operations.

This instrumented version of the program includes runtime checks to help identify scenarios that might lead to performance bottlenecks, as inferred from the analysis in Phase 2.
