### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Comparing Line-Level Hit Counts**: 
   - The primary loop (lines 11-16) on the slow input runs 499,999 times, but only once on the fast input. This indicates a significant difference in execution and a potential performance bottleneck.
   
2. **Pinpointing Lines with More Hits**:
   - The loop that starts on line 11 is the main contributor to the slowdown. The high hit counts for lines 12, 13, 14, 15, and 16 indicate that these are executed repeatedly on the slow input.
   
3. **Interacting with Data Structures**:
   - The loop is iterating over a range significantly larger than needed, from 1 to 1,000,000, which is unnecessary given the constraint `n ≤ 100,000`. The variables `l` and `r` are tracing a path from positions 1 and 1,000,000, respectively, inward until they meet or pass each other. The comparison with `a[t]` and `a[w]` (i.e., the positions of the prizes) causes the loop to terminate. 

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **Natural Language Performance Invariants**:

   - **Invariant 1**: "The program may slow down significantly when the positions of the prizes are centrally located, causing both `l` and `r` to iterate through a large number of non-prize positions. This happens when the prizes are positioned such that `l` and `r` must increment and decrement for a large range before reaching a prize position."
   
   - **Invariant 2**: "If the prizes are positioned such that the closest prize to the start position 1 (`a[t]`) or the closest prize to the start position 106 (`a[w]`) causes the loop to run significantly longer than necessary, the program's execution time increases. This indicates inefficiencies in handling cases where the prize positions are not optimally placed near the starting points."

2. **Thresholds and Constraints**:
   - These invariants align with the input constraints `n ≤ 100,000` and the maximum range of positions between 2 and 1,000,005. The critical factor is not the number of prizes but their distribution along the line, particularly when they are in the middle regions, extending the loop's execution unnecessarily.

3. **Correlations to Input Patterns**:
   - The inefficiency is notably pronounced when the prizes are located far from the initial starting points (1 and 106) but are not uniformly spread, leading to a more extended interval for `l` and `r` to reach the conditions to increment `t` or decrement `w`.

### Phase 3: Implementing Performance-Characterizing Invariants in C++

Here, I will translate the previously derived natural language invariants into C++ code that can check for performance bottlenecks at runtime.

#### Invariant 1 Check
This invariant checks if the prizes are located such that the iteration from `l` or `r` involves a large range of non-prize positions.
```cpp
void check_large_range_invariant(int l, int r, int t, int w) {
    if ((r - l > 100000) && (t <= w)) {
        cerr << "Warning: Large range without prizes causing performance bottleneck!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

#### Invariant 2 Check
This invariant checks if the first or last prize position causes prolonged execution because they are far from the starting positions.
```cpp
void check_far_prize_invariant(int a[], int n) {
    if ((a[1] > 500000) || (a[n] < 500000)) {
        cerr << "Warning: Prize position far from start causing prolonged execution!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrating Checks into the Original C++ Program

Now, I'll integrate these checks into the original program. The checks will be placed strategically to avoid adding overhead to tight loops, like the `for` loop in the code.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int a[1000001], n, i, t, w, l, r;

// Function to check large range without prizes
void check_large_range_invariant(int l, int r, int t, int w) {
    if ((r - l > 100000) && (t <= w)) {
        cerr << "Warning: Large range without prizes causing performance bottleneck!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Function to check if prizes are far from starting positions
void check_far_prize_invariant(int a[], int n) {
    if ((a[1] > 500000) || (a[n] < 500000)) {
        cerr << "Warning: Prize position far from start causing prolonged execution!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    scanf("%d", &n);
    for (i = 1; i <= n; i++) scanf("%d", &a[i]);

    // Check once after reading the input to ensure no extreme conditions
    check_far_prize_invariant(a, n);

    t = 1;
    w = n;
    l = 1;
    r = 1000000;
    
    for (i = 1; i <= 1000000; i++) {
        l++;
        r--;
        
        // Check during the loop execution to catch performance issues
        check_large_range_invariant(l, r, t, w);

        if (a[t] == l) t++;
        if (a[w] == r) w--;
        if (t > w) break;
    }
    
    printf("%d\n", i);
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Invariant Checks**: The `check_large_range_invariant` is invoked inside the loop to actively monitor if `l` and `r` are iterating over a large range without encountering a prize, which could lead to performance degradation.

2. **Initial Check**: The `check_far_prize_invariant` is run once after reading the input to ensure that the starting positions of the prizes don't already indicate a potentially expensive computation path due to their distance from the starting positions.

3. **Placement**: The `check_large_range_invariant` is placed within the loop but before the condition checks (`if (a[t] == l) ...`) to monitor the loop's performance without affecting the critical path operations. This way, we gain insights into performance issues without introducing additional computation overhead in tight loops.
