system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

You and your friend are participating in a TV show "Run For Your Prize".

At the start of the show n prizes are located on a straight line. i-th prize is located at position ai. Positions of all prizes are distinct. You start at position 1, your friend — at position 106 (and there is no prize in any of these two positions). You have to work as a team and collect all prizes in minimum possible time, in any order.

You know that it takes exactly 1 second to move from position x to position x + 1 or x - 1, both for you and your friend. You also have trained enough to instantly pick up any prize, if its position is equal to your current position (and the same is true for your friend). Carrying prizes does not affect your speed (or your friend's speed) at all.

Now you may discuss your strategy with your friend and decide who will pick up each prize. Remember that every prize must be picked up, either by you or by your friend.

What is the minimum number of seconds it will take to pick up all the prizes?

Input

The first line contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of prizes.

The second line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an (2 ≤ ai ≤ 106 - 1) — the positions of the prizes. No two prizes are located at the same position. Positions are given in ascending order.

Output

Print one integer — the minimum number of seconds it will take to collect all prizes.

Examples

Input

3
2 3 9


Output

8


Input

2
2 999995


Output

5

Note

In the first example you take all the prizes: take the first at 1, the second at 2 and the third at 8.

In the second example you take the first prize in 1 second and your friend takes the other in 5 seconds, you do this simultaneously, so the total time is 5.

assistant: To diagnose the performance issue in the given C program, let's analyze the hit counts and how they correlate with the slow and fast inputs. We'll then derive performance-characterizing invariants from this analysis.

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Comparing Hit Counts:**
   - The line `for (i = 2, j = 1e6 - 1; i < j && l < n; i++, j--, r++)` (line 18) shows significantly higher hit counts for the slow input (500,000) compared to the fast input (2).
   - The lines `if (a[i] == 1) l++;` (line 19) and `if (a[j] == 1) l++;` (line 20) also exhibit much higher hit counts for the slow input (499,999 each) compared to the fast input (1 each).

2. **Pinpointing Inefficient Segments:**
   - The loop in line 18 is the primary source of inefficiency. It likely iterates through a large portion of the array, checking each position for a prize.
   - This inefficient behavior is triggered when the prizes are spread out such that neither you nor your friend can quickly reach them all without iterating through many positions.

3. **Interaction with Data Structures:**
   - The array `a` is used to mark positions containing prizes. The loop iterates over this large array, potentially checking many positions with no prizes.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on this analysis, we can generate natural language statements describing conditions under which the program's execution slows down:

1. **Invariant 1: Widely Spread Prizes**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "If the prizes are spread out such that they are located far from both starting positions, the program will take longer to find a solution. This is especially true when the distance between prizes causes a long traversal through empty positions."
   
2. **Invariant 2: Edge Distribution**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "If the prizes are concentrated towards the middle of the range (far from the starting positions at 1 and 106), it may require more iterations to decide who should pick them up, particularly if there is an even spread in the middle."

With these invariants, we focus on patterns in the input data that escalate the traversal time through the loop. The large hit counts are indicative of the program iterating excessively due to the positioning of the prizes relative to the starting points. These invariants capture the essence of what causes the slowdown without relying on specific numeric values from the slow input. They instead focus on scenarios where the traversal path through the array `a` becomes lengthy or inefficient, which is useful for future inputs or testing scenarios.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
You and your friend are participating in a TV show "Run For Your Prize".

At the start of the show n prizes are located on a straight line. i-th prize is located at position ai. Positions of all prizes are distinct. You start at position 1, your friend — at position 106 (and there is no prize in any of these two positions). You have to work as a team and collect all prizes in minimum possible time, in any order.

You know that it takes exactly 1 second to move from position x to position x + 1 or x - 1, both for you and your friend. You also have trained enough to instantly pick up any prize, if its position is equal to your current position (and the same is true for your friend). Carrying prizes does not affect your speed (or your friend's speed) at all.

Now you may discuss your strategy with your friend and decide who will pick up each prize. Remember that every prize must be picked up, either by you or by your friend.

What is the minimum number of seconds it will take to pick up all the prizes?

Input

The first line contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of prizes.

The second line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an (2 ≤ ai ≤ 106 - 1) — the positions of the prizes. No two prizes are located at the same position. Positions are given in ascending order.

Output

Print one integer — the minimum number of seconds it will take to collect all prizes.

Examples

Input

3
2 3 9


Output

8


Input

2
2 999995


Output

5

Note

In the first example you take all the prizes: take the first at 1, the second at 2 and the third at 8.

In the second example you take the first prize in 1 second and your friend takes the other in 5 seconds, you do this simultaneously, so the total time is 5.

Solution (C++ code):
{solution}


assistant: Let's proceed with Phase 3, where we translate the performance-characterizing invariants derived in natural language into C++ code snippets that check these conditions at runtime.

### Phase 3: Implement the Natural Language Invariants in C++

#### Invariant 1: Widely Spread Prizes
- **Natural Language Description:** "If the prizes are spread out such that they are located far from both starting positions, the program will take longer to find a solution. This is especially true when the distance between prizes causes a long traversal through empty positions."

**C++ Code:**
```cpp
void check_spread_invariant(int first_prize_pos, int last_prize_pos) {
    if (first_prize_pos > 106 || last_prize_pos < 1) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to widely spread prizes!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

#### Invariant 2: Edge Distribution
- **Natural Language Description:** "If the prizes are concentrated towards the middle of the range (far from the starting positions at 1 and 106), it may require more iterations to decide who should pick them up, especially if there is an even spread in the middle."

**C++ Code:**
```cpp
void check_edge_distribution_invariant(int first_prize_pos, int last_prize_pos) {
    int middle_range = (last_prize_pos - first_prize_pos) / 2;
    if (first_prize_pos + middle_range > 106 && last_prize_pos - middle_range < 1) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to edge distribution of prizes!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

These checkers are designed to trigger when the prize distribution requires excessive traversal or decision-making due to their positions relative to the starting points.

### Phase 4: Integrate Conditional Checks into the Program

Now, let's integrate these checks into the original C++ program. We'll place the checks appropriately to ensure they do not add unnecessary overhead in tight loops.

**Instrumented C++ Code:**

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
const int N = 1e6 + 5;
int a[N];

void check_spread_invariant(int first_prize_pos, int last_prize_pos) {
    if (first_prize_pos > 106 || last_prize_pos < 1) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to widely spread prizes!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_edge_distribution_invariant(int first_prize_pos, int last_prize_pos) {
    int middle_range = (last_prize_pos - first_prize_pos) / 2;
    if (first_prize_pos + middle_range > 106 && last_prize_pos - middle_range < 1) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to edge distribution of prizes!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int32_t main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
    cin.tie(0);
    cout.tie(0);
    int n;
    cin >> n;

    int first_prize_pos = INT_MAX;
    int last_prize_pos = INT_MIN;

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        int l;
        cin >> l;
        a[l] = 1;
        first_prize_pos = min(first_prize_pos, l);
        last_prize_pos = max(last_prize_pos, l);
    }

    // Check for performance bottlenecks based on prize distribution
    check_spread_invariant(first_prize_pos, last_prize_pos);
    check_edge_distribution_invariant(first_prize_pos, last_prize_pos);

    int l = 0, r = 0;
    if (a[1] == 1) l++;
    if (a[(int)1e6] == 1) l++;
    for (int i = 2, j = 1e6 - 1; i < j && l < n; i++, j--, r++) {
        if (a[i] == 1) l++;
        if (a[j] == 1) l++;
    }
    cout << r << "\n";
    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**
- The `check_spread_invariant` function ensures that prizes are not excessively far from both starting positions, triggering an alert if they are.
- The `check_edge_distribution_invariant` function checks if prizes are concentrated in a way that complicates the decision on who should pick them up.
- Both checks are placed after reading all inputs and before the main processing loop to avoid overhead during critical execution paths.
