=== Invariants Response ===
To analyze the given C program, let's go through the two phases to understand why the program runs slowly for the "slow" input and derive performance-characterizing invariants.

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Hit Count Analysis**:
   - **Function `power` (lines 4-8)** is executed 31031000 times for the slow input and only 62 times for the fast input. This suggests that this function may be a significant contributor to the slow execution.
   - **Function `modInverse` (lines 10-11)** is called 1001000 times for the slow input but only 2 times for the fast input. This function calls `power`, adding to its high execution frequency.
   - The nested loops (lines 34-39) are executed a large number of times for the slow input: the outer loop runs 1001 times and the inner loop runs 501500 times for the slow input. For the fast input, these loops run only a couple of times.

2. **Interaction with Data Structures**:
   - The code involves computing combinations using the `ncr` function, which internally uses `modInverse` and `power`. This computation is done within nested loops, making it potentially expensive when `n` is large.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the analysis, the program enters a slow path under certain conditions. Here are the performance-characterizing invariants in natural language:

1. **Nested Loop Execution**:
   - "The program experiences a slowdown when `n` is large, leading to high iteration counts in nested loops. This results in repeated computation of combinations (nCr) for a vast number of array pairs."

2. **Recursive Power Calculation**:
   - "When `n` is large, the frequent use of the `power` function in calculating modular inverses increases execution time, as this function is executed recursively with large exponents."

3. **Cumulative Combinatorial Calculations**:
   - "The performance degrades when computing combinations for numerous indices, especially when both `i` and `j` in the loops span large ranges near `n`, resulting in extensive calculation time for factorial and modular inverse operations."

These invariants highlight that the bottleneck is primarily due to the factorial and power operations executed repeatedly within nested loops for large values of `n`. To potentially optimize, one could look into memoization or iterative methods to reduce the computational overhead of these operations.

=== Checker Response ===
Let's proceed with the task by translating the performance-characterizing invariants into C++ code (Phase 3) and then integrating those checks into the original C++ program (Phase 4).

### Phase 3: Implement Performance-Characterizing Invariants in C++

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstdlib>  // For abort()

void check_nested_loop_invariant(int n) {
    if (n > 900) {  // Using 900 as a threshold to indicate large n values.
        std::cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered by large 'n' in nested loops!" << std::endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_power_function_calls(int powerCalls) {
    if (powerCalls > 1000000) {  // Indicating excessive calls to the power function.
        std::cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered by excessive power function calls!" << std::endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_combinatorial_calculations(int n, int m) {
    if (n > 900 && m == 1) {  // Large 'n' and specific 'm' indicating heavy combinatorial calculations.
        std::cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered by extensive combinatorial calculations!" << std::endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrate Invariants into the Original Program

Now, we'll integrate these checks into the provided C++ solution, ensuring they are placed at suitable points to avoid unnecessary overhead.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
const long long int maxN = 100005;

void check_nested_loop_invariant(int n) {
    if (n > 900) {  // Using 900 as a threshold to indicate large n values.
        std::cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered by large 'n' in nested loops!" << std::endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_power_function_calls(int powerCalls) {
    if (powerCalls > 1000000) {  // Indicating excessive calls to the power function.
        std::cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered by excessive power function calls!" << std::endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_combinatorial_calculations(int n, int m) {
    if (n > 900 && m == 1) {  // Large 'n' and specific 'm' indicating heavy combinatorial calculations.
        std::cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered by extensive combinatorial calculations!" << std::endl;
        abort();
    }
}

long long int power(long long int x, long long int y, long long int m) {
    static int powerCalls = 0;
    powerCalls++;
    check_power_function_calls(powerCalls);

    if (y == 0) return 1;
    long long int p = power(x, y / 2, m) % m;
    p = (p * p) % m;
    return (y % 2 == 0) ? p : (x * p) % m;
}

long long int modInverse(long long int a) {
    return power(a, 1000000007 - 2, 1000000007);
}

long long int factorials[maxN];
void fact(long long int n) {
    factorials[0] = 1;
    long long int i = 1;
    while (i <= n) {
        factorials[i] = (factorials[i - 1] * i) % 1000000007;
        i++;
    }
}

long long int ncr(long long int n, long long int r) {
    return factorials[n] *
           modInverse((factorials[r] * (factorials[n - r])) % 1000000007) %
           1000000007;
}

int main() {
    std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    long long int n, m;
    fact(10000);
    cin >> n >> m;

    // Check conditions before entering the nested loops
    check_nested_loop_invariant(n);
    check_combinatorial_calculations(n, m);

    long long int i, j, ans = 0, z = 0;
    for (i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        for (j = i; j <= n; j++) {
            ans += ((ncr(i + m - 2, max(z, m - 1)) % 1000000007) *
                    (ncr(n - j + m - 1, max(z, m - 1)) % 1000000007)) %
                   1000000007;
            ans = ans % 1000000007;
        }
    }
    cout << ans;
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:

- **`check_nested_loop_invariant(n)`**: This function checks the size of `n` before entering the nested loops, assuming that large values of `n` can indicate a potential slow execution path.
- **`check_power_function_calls(powerCalls)`**: This function monitors the number of times the `power` function is called, aborting if it exceeds a threshold indicating excessive computations.
- **`check_combinatorial_calculations(n, m)`**: This check ensures that the computation for large `n` and specific values of `m`, which indicate heavy calculations, is monitored for potential slowdowns.

These checks are inserted at strategic points to monitor performance without adding significant overhead during execution.
