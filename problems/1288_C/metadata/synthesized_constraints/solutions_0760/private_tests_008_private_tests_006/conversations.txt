system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

You are given two integers n and m. Calculate the number of pairs of arrays (a, b) such that:

  * the length of both arrays is equal to m; 
  * each element of each array is an integer between 1 and n (inclusive); 
  * a_i ≤ b_i for any index i from 1 to m; 
  * array a is sorted in non-descending order; 
  * array b is sorted in non-ascending order. 



As the result can be very large, you should print it modulo 10^9+7.

Input

The only line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10).

Output

Print one integer – the number of arrays a and b satisfying the conditions described above modulo 10^9+7.

assistant: To analyze the given C program, let's go through the two phases to understand why the program runs slowly for the "slow" input and derive performance-characterizing invariants.

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Hit Count Analysis**:
   - **Function `power` (lines 4-8)** is executed 31031000 times for the slow input and only 62 times for the fast input. This suggests that this function may be a significant contributor to the slow execution.
   - **Function `modInverse` (lines 10-11)** is called 1001000 times for the slow input but only 2 times for the fast input. This function calls `power`, adding to its high execution frequency.
   - The nested loops (lines 34-39) are executed a large number of times for the slow input: the outer loop runs 1001 times and the inner loop runs 501500 times for the slow input. For the fast input, these loops run only a couple of times.

2. **Interaction with Data Structures**:
   - The code involves computing combinations using the `ncr` function, which internally uses `modInverse` and `power`. This computation is done within nested loops, making it potentially expensive when `n` is large.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the analysis, the program enters a slow path under certain conditions. Here are the performance-characterizing invariants in natural language:

1. **Nested Loop Execution**:
   - "The program experiences a slowdown when `n` is large, leading to high iteration counts in nested loops. This results in repeated computation of combinations (nCr) for a vast number of array pairs."

2. **Recursive Power Calculation**:
   - "When `n` is large, the frequent use of the `power` function in calculating modular inverses increases execution time, as this function is executed recursively with large exponents."

3. **Cumulative Combinatorial Calculations**:
   - "The performance degrades when computing combinations for numerous indices, especially when both `i` and `j` in the loops span large ranges near `n`, resulting in extensive calculation time for factorial and modular inverse operations."

These invariants highlight that the bottleneck is primarily due to the factorial and power operations executed repeatedly within nested loops for large values of `n`. To potentially optimize, one could look into memoization or iterative methods to reduce the computational overhead of these operations.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
You are given two integers n and m. Calculate the number of pairs of arrays (a, b) such that:

  * the length of both arrays is equal to m; 
  * each element of each array is an integer between 1 and n (inclusive); 
  * a_i ≤ b_i for any index i from 1 to m; 
  * array a is sorted in non-descending order; 
  * array b is sorted in non-ascending order. 



As the result can be very large, you should print it modulo 10^9+7.

Input

The only line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10).

Output

Print one integer – the number of arrays a and b satisfying the conditions described above modulo 10^9+7.

Solution (C++ code):
{solution}


assistant: Let's proceed with the task by translating the performance-characterizing invariants into C++ code (Phase 3) and then integrating those checks into the original C++ program (Phase 4).

### Phase 3: Implement Performance-Characterizing Invariants in C++

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstdlib>  // For abort()

void check_nested_loop_invariant(int n) {
    if (n > 900) {  // Using 900 as a threshold to indicate large n values.
        std::cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered by large 'n' in nested loops!" << std::endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_power_function_calls(int powerCalls) {
    if (powerCalls > 1000000) {  // Indicating excessive calls to the power function.
        std::cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered by excessive power function calls!" << std::endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_combinatorial_calculations(int n, int m) {
    if (n > 900 && m == 1) {  // Large 'n' and specific 'm' indicating heavy combinatorial calculations.
        std::cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered by extensive combinatorial calculations!" << std::endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrate Invariants into the Original Program

Now, we'll integrate these checks into the provided C++ solution, ensuring they are placed at suitable points to avoid unnecessary overhead.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
const long long int maxN = 100005;

void check_nested_loop_invariant(int n) {
    if (n > 900) {  // Using 900 as a threshold to indicate large n values.
        std::cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered by large 'n' in nested loops!" << std::endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_power_function_calls(int powerCalls) {
    if (powerCalls > 1000000) {  // Indicating excessive calls to the power function.

### Explanation:

- **`check_nested_loop_invariant(n)`**: This function checks the size of `n` before entering the nested loops, assuming that large values of `n` can indicate a potential slow execution path.
- **`check_power_function_calls(powerCalls)`**: This function monitors the number of times the `power` function is called, aborting if it exceeds a threshold indicating excessive computations.
- **`check_combinatorial_calculations(n, m)`**: This check ensures that the computation for large `n` and specific values of `m`, which indicate heavy calculations, is monitored for potential slowdowns.

These checks are inserted at strategic points to monitor performance without adding significant overhead during execution.
