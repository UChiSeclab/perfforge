### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Line-level Hit Count Analysis**:
   - The function `power(long long n, long long r)` is called excessively during the slow run with a significant number of hits (62,062,000 vs. 124 hits in the fast run).
   - The nested loops in the `arrays(long long n, long long m)` function contribute to the high hit count. Specifically, line 27 (`for (long long i = 1; i <= n; i++)`) and line 28 (`for (long long j = i; j <= n; j++)`) have a high hit count in the slow run compared to the fast run.

2. **Function Calls and Operations**:
   - The combination function `comb(long long n, long long m)` and the factorial caching function `fact(long long n)` are both frequently called within nested loops, leading to a performance bottleneck when `n` is large.
   - Recursive calculations in the power and combination functions cause significant repetitive calculations, especially due to the properties of power function usage in modular arithmetic.

3. **Data Structure Interactions**:
   - The factorial results are cached in the array `a`, but caching does not alleviate the overhead caused by repeated calls to `power()` within `comb()`, especially in loops.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants (Natural Language)

1. **Invariant 1: Large Range of Values**
   - **Natural Language Description**: "The program may slow down significantly when input `n` is large. This is because the high value of `n` increases the number of iterations in nested loops, causing excessive recalculations of combinations."
   - **Explanation**: A large `n` leads to a quadratic increase in the number of operations, especially in nested loops, resulting in repeated calculations and increased computational overhead.

2. **Invariant 2: Nested Loop Complexity**
   - **Natural Language Description**: "Performance degradation occurs when both `n` and `m` are high, leading to deeply nested loops and expensive combination calculations."
   - **Explanation**: The program's complexity escalates with larger `m`, increasing the workload of nested loops and exacerbating the performance impact of combination computations.

3. **Invariant 3: Repeated Calculations in Critical Functions**
   - **Natural Language Description**: "When `n` leads to numerous hits in critical arithmetic functions like power and combination, the calculations become repetitive and costly."
   - **Explanation**: The modular arithmetic functions, particularly `power()`, are repeatedly invoked for each calculation of combinations, causing a significant performance hit when `n` is large.

4. **Invariant 4: Inefficient Caching**
   - **Natural Language Description**: "Inefficient caching strategies, such as the one used for factorial computation, do not adequately reduce the computational demand for large input sizes."
   - **Explanation**: The caching of factorials in an array does not sufficiently optimize for the repeated calculations of combinations since the power function recalculates exponentials frequently.

By understanding these conditions, it is possible to refine the solution, optimize the calculations, or adjust the approach to minimize the impact of these identified bottlenecks.

### Phase 3: Implement the Natural Language Invariants as C++ Checkers

Here, I'll translate the natural language performance-characterizing invariants we previously derived into C++ code snippets that can be used as runtime checks.

1. **Checker for Large Input Size**:
   - This check ensures that the input size `n` does not lead to excessive iterations in nested loops.

```cpp
void check_large_n(long long n) {
    if (n > 900) { // Assuming 900 as a threshold based on problem constraints to avoid excessive iterations
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to large value of n!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

2. **Checker for Nested Loop Complexity**:
   - This check ensures that both `n` and `m` together do not cause deeply nested loops leading to performance degradation.

```cpp
void check_nested_loops(long long n, long long m) {
    if (n > 900 && m > 5) { // Assuming 900 for n and 5 for m as thresholds to avoid complexity in loops
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to deeply nested loops!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

3. **Checker for Repeated Calculations**:
   - This check addresses the repeated calls in arithmetic operations which can be costly.

```cpp
void check_repeated_calculations(long long n, long long calls) {
    if (n > 900 && calls > 1000000) { // Assuming 1000000 as a call threshold
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to excessive repeated calculations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrate Checkers into the Original C++ Program

Now, I'll integrate these checkers into the original C++ program, ensuring they are placed optimally to catch performance issues without adding overhead in tight loops.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
const long long mod = 1e9 + 7;
long long a[2000];

void check_large_n(long long n) {
    if (n > 900) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to large value of n!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_nested_loops(long long n, long long m) {
    if (n > 900 && m > 5) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to deeply nested loops!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_repeated_calculations(long long n, long long calls) {
    if (n > 900 && calls > 1000000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to excessive repeated calculations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

long long power(long long n, long long r) {
    long long ans = 1;
    long long call_count = 0; // Counter for repeated calculations
    while (r > 0) {
        if (r & 1) ans = (ans * n) % mod;
        n = (n * n) % mod;
        r >>= 1;
        call_count++;
    }
    check_repeated_calculations(n, call_count); // Check for excessive calls
    return ans;
}

long long fact(long long n) {
    if (a[n] != 0) return a[n];
    long long ans = 1;
    for (long long i = 1; i <= n; i++) ans = (ans * i) % mod;
    return a[n] = ans;
}

long long comb(long long n, long long m) {
    return ((((fact(n) % mod) * (power(fact(m), mod - 2))) % mod) *
            (power(fact(n - m), mod - 2) % mod)) %
           mod;
}

long long arrays(long long n, long long m) {
    long long ans = 0;
    for (long long i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        for (long long j = i; j <= n; j++) {
            long long x = (((comb(i + m - 2, m - 1) % mod) *
                            (comb(n - j + m - 1, m - 1) % mod)) %
                           mod);
            ans = (ans + x) % mod;
        }
    }
    return ans;
}

int32_t main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);
    long long n, m;
    cin >> n >> m;

    // Checkers for input and loop complexity
    check_large_n(n);
    check_nested_loops(n, m);

    cout << arrays(n, m) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

- **Check Placement**: The checks for `n` and nested loop complexity are placed after reading the inputs to prevent the program from executing costly operations if these conditions are met.
- **Repetition Counter**: A counter is introduced within the `power` function to ensure that excessive calls are monitored. This helps catch performance bottlenecks due to repeated calculations.
