### Phase 1: Identification of Expensive Code Segments

1. **Hit Count Analysis:**
   - The `while` loop at line 11 (`while (rem >= m)`) has a significantly higher hit count for the slow input (1,000,000,000) compared to the fast input (1). This indicates that the loop executes many more times during the slow run.
   - Lines 12 and 13 within this loop (`rem -= m;` and `nmin++;`) also have high hit counts for the slow input, confirming that the loop's body is repeatedly executed.

2. **Function Call Analysis:**
   - The combination function `C(n, r)` is called multiple times, but its computational cost is dwarfed by the sheer number of iterations in the `while` loop.

3. **Interaction with Data Structures:**
   - There are no complex data structures aside from basic arithmetic operations and calls to the combination function. The issue is primarily the repetitive loop execution rather than data structure manipulation.

4. **Input Constraints Interaction:**
   - The problem constraints allow `n` and `m` to go up to 1 billion, making the loop execution a potential bottleneck when `m` is small relative to `n`, especially when `m = 1` as seen in the slow input.

### Phase 2: Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **Invariant 1: High Iteration Loop Trigger**
   - **Natural Language Description:**
     "If the number of remaining participants (n - m) is extremely large and almost all participants need to be divided into teams, then the loop to calculate `kmin` will execute an enormous number of times, which can significantly slow down the program."
   - **Threshold Consideration:**
     The loop's execution time becomes problematic when the difference between participants and teams is maximized, especially when `m` is close to 1 and `n` is large.

2. **Invariant 2: Small Team Size Effect**
   - **Natural Language Description:**
     "When the number of teams (m) is much smaller than the number of participants (n), and especially when m is equal to 1, the program may enter a slow path due to extensive loop iterations needed to distribute participants across teams."
   - **Threshold Consideration:**
     The smallest possible value for `m` is 1, which maximizes the loop iterations, causing the slowdown.

3. **Invariant 3: Arithmetic Operation Overhead**
   - **Natural Language Description:**
     "If the program must repeatedly adjust the number of remaining participants (`rem`) across a very large number of iterations, the cumulative effect of these arithmetic operations can degrade performance."
   - **Threshold Consideration:**
     Though each operation is individually inexpensive, their repetition becomes significant when `n - m` is large.

These invariants capture the primary conditions under which the program transitions into a slow path, focusing on the loop's behavior when dealing with large values of `n` and small values of `m`.

### Phase 3: Implement Performance-Characterizing Invariants in C++

For each performance-characterizing invariant identified earlier, we will write a C++ code snippet to check the condition at runtime.

1. **Invariant 1: High Iteration Loop Trigger**
   ```cpp
   void check_high_iteration_invariant(long long rem, long long m) {
       if (rem >= 100000000 && m == 1) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high iteration in loop." << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Invariant 2: Small Team Size Effect**
   ```cpp
   void check_small_team_invariant(long long n, long long m) {
       if (m == 1 && n > 100000000) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - small team size effect." << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Invariant 3: Arithmetic Operation Overhead**
   ```cpp
   void check_arithmetic_operation_invariant(long long rem, long long m) {
       if ((rem / m) > 100000000) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - arithmetic operation overhead." << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Integrate Conditional Checks into Original C++ Program

Now we integrate these checks into the original program at appropriate locations to detect when the program may enter a slow path.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

long long int C(long long int n, long long int r);

void check_high_iteration_invariant(long long rem, long long m) {
    if (rem >= 100000000 && m == 1) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high iteration in loop." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_small_team_invariant(long long n, long long m) {
    if (m == 1 && n > 100000000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - small team size effect." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_arithmetic_operation_invariant(long long rem, long long m) {
    if ((rem / m) > 100000000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - arithmetic operation overhead." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    long long int n, m;
    cin >> n >> m;

    // Check for invariants before entering critical computations
    check_small_team_invariant(n, m);

    long long int kmin = 0, kmax = 0;
    long long int rem = n - m;

    // Check for high iteration loop invariant
    check_high_iteration_invariant(rem, m);

    kmax = (m == n ? 0 : C(rem + 1, 2));

    long long int nmin = 1;
    while (rem >= m) {
        rem -= m;
        nmin++;
    }

    // Check for arithmetic operation overhead invariant
    check_arithmetic_operation_invariant(rem, m);

    kmin = (rem) * C(nmin + 1, 2) + (m - rem) * C(nmin, 2);

    cout << kmin << " " << kmax << '\n';
    return 0;
}

long long int C(long long int n, long long int r) {
    long long int num = 1, den = 1;
    while (r) {
        num *= n - r + 1;
        den *= r;
        r--;
    }
    return num / den;
}
```

### Explanation of Code Placement:
- **`check_small_team_invariant(n, m)`**: Placed immediately after reading inputs, to catch cases where `m = 1` and `n` is exceedingly large.
- **`check_high_iteration_invariant(rem, m)`**: Placed just before entering the potentially long-running `while` loop.
- **`check_arithmetic_operation_invariant(rem, m)`**: Placed after the loop to ensure that the arithmetic operations do not become excessive post-loop execution.

These checks will help identify and abort execution when the program enters a state that is known to cause performance issues, aiding in debugging and optimization efforts.
