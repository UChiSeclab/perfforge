system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

Fox Ciel has a robot on a 2D plane. Initially it is located in (0, 0). Fox Ciel code a command to it. The command was represented by string s. Each character of s is one move operation. There are four move operations at all:

  * 'U': go up, (x, y)  →  (x, y+1); 
  * 'D': go down, (x, y)  →  (x, y-1); 
  * 'L': go left, (x, y)  →  (x-1, y); 
  * 'R': go right, (x, y)  →  (x+1, y). 



The robot will do the operations in s from left to right, and repeat it infinite times. Help Fox Ciel to determine if after some steps the robot will located in (a, b).

Input

The first line contains two integers a and b, ( - 109 ≤ a, b ≤ 109). The second line contains a string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 100, s only contains characters 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R') — the command.

Output

Print "Yes" if the robot will be located at (a, b), and "No" otherwise.

Examples

Input

2 2
RU


Output

Yes


Input

1 2
RU


Output

No


Input

-1 1000000000
LRRLU


Output

Yes


Input

0 0
D


Output

Yes

Note

In the first and second test case, command string is "RU", so the robot will go right, then go up, then right, and then up and so on.

The locations of its moves are (0, 0)  →  (1, 0)  →  (1, 1)  →  (2, 1)  →  (2, 2)  →  ...

So it can reach (2, 2) but not (1, 2).

assistant: ### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Line-Level Hit Count Comparison:**
   - The function `get(char c)` (lines 10-14) is called significantly more often during the slow run compared to the fast run. Specifically, lines 10, 11, and 12 show a dramatic increase in hit counts with the slow input.
   - The `check(long long mul)` function (lines 15-32) also has a higher number of executions for the slow input, particularly lines 23-27, where the loop iterates over the string, performing position updates and checks.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - The main slowdown arises from the repetitive execution of `check()` driven by the outer loop in `main()` (lines 49 and 54), which iterates from `tmp - 5000` to `tmp + 5000`.
   - The nested loop inside `check()` iterates over the command string `s`, repeatedly calling `get()` to translate each character.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **Invariant #1: High Repetition of Command Execution**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "If the cumulative movement vector resulting from the command string is small or zero, and there is a large number of potential repetitions to test for the target coordinates, the program may slow significantly."
   - **Explanation:** The slow input causes many `check()` calls due to minimal cumulative movement by the command string, leading the loops to explore a large range of multipliers (`ha`), compounding the time spent in the nested loop for each `ha`.

2. **Invariant #2: High Multiplier Range**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "When the calculated range for possible multipliers is large, the program will repeatedly execute checks over a broad range, significantly increasing execution time."
   - **Explanation:** The range of `ha` values (`tmp - 5000` to `tmp + 5000`) is potentially large due to the command sequence's ineffective progression towards the target, causing many redundant checks.

3. **Invariant #3: Frequent Calls to Character Translation**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "Frequent and redundant character translation in iterations or recursive calls can lead to performance bottlenecks, especially when processing each character of a long command string."
   - **Explanation:** The `get()` function is frequently called for each character of `s`, and the high hit counts suggest a bottleneck when this occurs repeatedly across many `check()` calls.

### General Recommendations

- **Threshold Values:** The multipliers (`ha`) are iterated extensively when the command doesn't significantly accelerate the robot towards the target. This can be viewed as a performance concern when `|a / xx|` or `|b / yy|` is close to zero.
- **Avoid Hardcoding:** The constants in the loops could be replaced with more adaptive strategies that adjust based on the net movement or characteristics of the command string.
- **Fuzzer Utility:** The invariants should warn of potential slowdowns when the net movement (sum of `xx` and `yy`) is small, prompting a large range of `ha` values. This guides a fuzzer to test such scenarios.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
Fox Ciel has a robot on a 2D plane. Initially it is located in (0, 0). Fox Ciel code a command to it. The command was represented by string s. Each character of s is one move operation. There are four move operations at all:

  * 'U': go up, (x, y)  →  (x, y+1); 
  * 'D': go down, (x, y)  →  (x, y-1); 
  * 'L': go left, (x, y)  →  (x-1, y); 
  * 'R': go right, (x, y)  →  (x+1, y). 



The robot will do the operations in s from left to right, and repeat it infinite times. Help Fox Ciel to determine if after some steps the robot will located in (a, b).

Input

The first line contains two integers a and b, ( - 109 ≤ a, b ≤ 109). The second line contains a string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 100, s only contains characters 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R') — the command.

Output

Print "Yes" if the robot will be located at (a, b), and "No" otherwise.

So it can reach (2, 2) but not (1, 2).

Solution (C++ code):
{solution}


assistant: ### Phase 3: Implement the Natural Language Invariants in C++

Below are the checker functions derived from the performance-characterizing invariants:

```cpp
void check_zero_movement_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - zero cumulative movement vector!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_large_multiplier_range_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large multiplier range!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_frequent_translation_calls_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - frequent get() calls!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrate Checker Functions into the Program

Here is the instrumented C++ code with the integrated performance checks:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

long long a, b;
int n;
long long xx = 0, yy = 0;
char s[1024];
char cc[7] = "RULD";
int dx[4] = {1, 0, -1, 0};
int dy[4] = {0, 1, 0, -1};

int get(char c) {
    for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
        if (cc[i] == c) return i;
    }
    return -1; // To ensure function returns something
}

void check_zero_movement_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - zero cumulative movement vector!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_large_multiplier_range_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large multiplier range!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_frequent_translation_calls_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - frequent get() calls!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check(long long mul) {
    int i;
    long long x = xx * mul;
    long long y = yy * mul;
    if (x == a && y == b) {
        puts("Yes");
        exit(0);
    }
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        int id = get(s[i]);
        x += dx[id];
        y += dy[id];
        if (x == a && y == b) {
            puts("Yes");
            exit(0);
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    int i, j, k;
    cin >> a >> b;
    scanf("%s", s);
    n = strlen(s);

    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        int id = get(s[i]);
        xx += dx[id];
        yy += dy[id];
    }

    // Check for zero movement vector invariant
    check_zero_movement_invariant(xx == 0 && yy == 0);

    if (xx == 0 && yy == 0) {
        check(0);
    } else {
        long long tmp;
        if (xx) {
            tmp = a / xx;
            // Check for large multiplier range invariant
            check_large_multiplier_range_invariant(tmp > 5000 || tmp < -5000);
            for (long long ha = max(0ll, tmp - 5000); ha <= tmp + 5000; ha++)
                check(ha);
        }
        if (yy) {
            tmp = b / yy;
            // Check for large multiplier range invariant
            check_large_multiplier_range_invariant(tmp > 5000 || tmp < -5000);
            for (long long ha = max(0ll, tmp - 5000); ha <= tmp + 5000; ha++)
                check(ha);
        }
    }

    // Check for frequent get() calls invariant
    check_frequent_translation_calls_invariant(n > 50); // Arbitrary threshold for illustration

    puts("No");
    return 0;
}
```

### Comments on Instrumentation

1. **`check_zero_movement_invariant`:** Triggered if both `xx` and `yy` are zero after processing the command string, meaning the robot won't advance toward the target, potentially resulting in futile attempts.
   
2. **`check_large_multiplier_range_invariant`:** Evaluates if the calculated multiplier `tmp` suggests a large range, which can lead to excessive `check()` calls.

3. **`check_frequent_translation_calls_invariant`:** Assumes excessive calls to `get()` may occur when the command string is long. A threshold is arbitrarily set at 50 to illustrate where this might be checked.

By placing these checks strategically in the control flow, we ensure they are evaluated before entering heavy computational loops, thus helping a fuzzer or analyst identify potential slow paths effectively.
