system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

At first, let's define function f(x) as follows: $$$ \begin{matrix} f(x) & = & \left\{ \begin{matrix} x/2 & \mbox{if } x  is even \\\ x - 1 & \mbox{otherwise } \end{matrix} \right. \end{matrix} $$$

We can see that if we choose some value v and will apply function f to it, then apply f to f(v), and so on, we'll eventually get 1. Let's write down all values we get in this process in a list and denote this list as path(v). For example, path(1) = [1], path(15) = [15, 14, 7, 6, 3, 2, 1], path(32) = [32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1].

Let's write all lists path(x) for every x from 1 to n. The question is next: what is the maximum value y such that y is contained in at least k different lists path(x)?

Formally speaking, you need to find maximum y such that \left| \{ x ~|~ 1 ≤ x ≤ n, y ∈ path(x) \} \right| ≥ k.

Input

The first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^{18}).

Output

Print the only integer — the maximum value that is contained in at least k paths.

Note

In the first example, the answer is 5, since 5 occurs in path(5), path(10) and path(11).

In the second example, the answer is 4, since 4 occurs in path(4), path(5), path(8), path(9), path(10) and path(11).

In the third example n = k, so the answer is 1, since 1 is the only number occuring in all paths for integers from 1 to 20.

assistant: ### Phase 1: Identifying Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

Based on the hit count comparison between the slow and fast runs, we observe:

1. **Function `check`**:
   - The `check` function is a major hot spot during the slow run, invoked 118 times, while it is never invoked in the fast run. This suggests that this function might be contributing to the slowdown.
   
2. **Line-Level Analysis within `check`**:
   - The lines performing repeated operations on strings (`N` and `X`) see a lot of activity:
     - Line 7: Binary conversion of `n` is hit 7198 times.
     - Line 9: Binary conversion of `x` is hit 7196 times.
   - The nested loop in lines 22-26 is significantly hit, especially:
     - Line 23: The outer loop, hit 14040 times.
     - Line 24: Within the inner loop, hit 14040 times.

3. **Explanation of Observed Behavior**:
   - Converting integers to their binary representation repeatedly is expensive, especially for large numbers, as evidenced by the multiple hits on lines involving these conversions.
   - The presence of a nested loop structure operating over these representations increases computational effort as it scales with the size of the binary strings.

4. **Binary Search in `main`**:
   - The binary search loops (lines 39-44 and 49-54) iterate multiple times, and each iteration involves calling the `check` function, compounding the performance hit from within `check`.

### Phase 2: Deriving Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the above analysis, we can summarize the performance-triggering conditions as follows:

1. **Binary Representation Conversions**:
   - **Invariant**: "If the function `check` is called with large values of `n`, requiring frequent binary conversions of these values, the program may experience performance degradation due to repeated time-consuming operations."
   - **Threshold**: The operations scale with the bit-length of the numbers, implying that for very large `n` close to the maximum constraint (10^18), these conversions become costly.

2. **Nested Loop over Binary Strings**:
   - **Invariant**: "When binary representations of numbers have significantly different lengths, and nested loops operate over these binary strings, the computation may become inefficient due to the number of iterations."
   - **Threshold**: The difference in binary string lengths drives the loop depth, suggesting inefficiency when `n` is large, causing a greater depth of binary comparisons.

3. **Binary Search Invocation**:
   - **Invariant**: "If the binary search in `main` must evaluate the `check` function many times due to a high number of potential candidates (`n` large), performance may degrade as each step involves recomputation."
   - **Threshold**: The bounds of the search (0 to n/2) suggest potential inefficiency as they increase with `n`, especially when `k` is low, increasing the search space.

These invariants suggest that the slow case is characterized by high values of `n`, which result in costly binary conversions and extensive nested loops traversals. Optimization could focus on reducing string operations or optimizing the nested loop structure.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
At first, let's define function f(x) as follows: $$$ \begin{matrix} f(x) & = & \left\{ \begin{matrix} x/2 & \mbox{if } x  is even \\\ x - 1 & \mbox{otherwise } \end{matrix} \right. \end{matrix} $$$

We can see that if we choose some value v and will apply function f to it, then apply f to f(v), and so on, we'll eventually get 1. Let's write down all values we get in this process in a list and denote this list as path(v). For example, path(1) = [1], path(15) = [15, 14, 7, 6, 3, 2, 1], path(32) = [32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1].

Let's write all lists path(x) for every x from 1 to n. The question is next: what is the maximum value y such that y is contained in at least k different lists path(x)?

Formally speaking, you need to find maximum y such that \left| \{ x ~|~ 1 ≤ x ≤ n, y ∈ path(x) \} \right| ≥ k.

Input

The first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^{18}).

Output

Print the only integer — the maximum value that is contained in at least k paths.

Note

In the first example, the answer is 5, since 5 occurs in path(5), path(10) and path(11).

In the second example, the answer is 4, since 4 occurs in path(4), path(5), path(8), path(9), path(10) and path(11).

In the third example n = k, so the answer is 1, since 1 is the only number occuring in all paths for integers from 1 to 20.

assistant: ### Phase 3: Implementing Performance-Characterizing Invariants in C++

Below are the C++ implementations of the identified performance-characterizing invariants. These checks help identify potential performance bottlenecks by using runtime conditions based on the earlier analysis.

```cpp
void check_binary_conversion_invariant(unsigned long long n) {
    // This checks if the binary conversion of n is large,
    // which can lead to performance degradation.
    if (n > (1ULL << 60)) { // Considering a large bit length for n
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to large binary conversion of n!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_nested_loop_invariant(size_t N_size, size_t X_size) {
    // This checks if the nested loop will iterate significantly due to different lengths of N and X.
    if ((N_size - X_size) > 30) { // Threshold set for length difference
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to extensive nested loop iterations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_binary_search_invariant(unsigned long long n, unsigned long long k) {
    // This checks if the binary search may lead to inefficiency with a large search space
    if (n > (1ULL << 55) && k < n / 2) { // Large n and small k causing large search space
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to large search space in binary search!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrating Performance Checks into the Original Program

Now, we will integrate these checks into the original C++ program at appropriate locations to ensure we catch potential slowdowns without adding unnecessary overhead.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

unsigned long long pw[64];

bool check(unsigned long long x, unsigned long long n, unsigned long long k) {
    if (!x) return 1;
    string N;
    while (n) N = char(n % 2 + '0') + N, n /= 2;
    string X;
    while (x) X = char(x % 2 + '0') + X, x /= 2;

    // Check for nested loop inefficiency due to binary string length differences
    check_nested_loop_invariant(N.size(), X.size());

    unsigned long long ans = 0;
    if (X.size() < N.size()) {
        for (int i = X.size(); i < (int)N.size(); ++i)
            ans += pw[i - (int)X.size() + (X.back() == '0')];
    }
    int xsiz = X.size();
    while (X.size() < N.size()) X += '0';
    if (X <= N) {
        vector<unsigned long long> dp[2];
        dp[0].resize(N.size() + 1);
        dp[1].resize(N.size() + 1);
        dp[0][0] = 1;
        for (int i = 0; i < N.size(); ++i) {
            for (int f = 0; f < 2; ++f) {
                dp[f | (X[i] < N[i])][i + 1] += dp[f][i];
                if (i >= xsiz - 1 && X[i] == '0' && (f || X[i] < N[i]))
                    dp[f][i + 1] += dp[f][i];
            }
        }
        ans += dp[0][N.size()] + dp[1][N.size()];
    }
    return ans >= k;
}

int main() {
    pw[0] = 1;
    for (int i = 1; i < 64; ++i) pw[i] = pw[i - 1] * 2;

    unsigned long long n, k;
    scanf("%llu %llu", &n, &k);

    // Check for binary conversion performance bottleneck
    check_binary_conversion_invariant(n);

    unsigned long long lb = 0, rb = n / 2;
    while (lb < rb) {
        unsigned long long md = (lb + rb + 1) >> 1;
        if (check(md * 2, n, k))
            lb = md;
        else
            rb = md - 1;
    }
    unsigned long long ans = lb * 2;

    lb = 0;
    rb = (n - 1) / 2;
    while (lb < rb) {
        unsigned long long md = (lb + rb + 1) >> 1;
        if (check(md * 2 + 1, n, k))
            lb = md;
        else
            rb = md - 1;
    }

    // Check for binary search inefficiency
    check_binary_search_invariant(n, k);

    ans = max(ans, lb * 2 + 1);
    printf("%llu\n", ans);
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

- **Binary Conversion Check**: Inserted at the start of `main` to ensure the input value for `n` does not lead to extensive binary operations.
- **Nested Loop Check**: Placed at the start of the `check` function to avoid excessive iterations based on binary string differences.
- **Binary Search Check**: Before the final assignment to `ans`, ensuring the binary search does not become inefficient with large inputs. 

These checks help detect performance bottlenecks early in execution, preventing operations known to degrade performance.
