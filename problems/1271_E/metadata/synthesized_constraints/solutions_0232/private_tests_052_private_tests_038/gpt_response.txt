### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

Upon analyzing the provided code and the hit counts, we can pinpoint certain areas that contribute to the slowdown in the slow input case:

1. **Function Calls to `check`:**
   - The function `check` is invoked multiple times, with hit counts indicating 1890 calls for the slow input compared to just 2 for the fast input. This is a clear indicator of inefficiency. 

2. **Loops inside `check`:**
   - The loop on lines 9-10 and 15-16 are executed numerous times, especially the loop starting at line 9 with 35,991 iterations for the slow input, while it is not entered during the fast input. This suggests a dependency on input size and structure.

3. **Double Loop in `main`:**
   - The loop beginning at line 63 is executed 61 times for the slow input, which is notably more than the 2 times for the fast input. Each iteration calls the `check` function multiple times, resulting in a compounded effect on performance.
   
4. **Binary String Manipulation:**
   - On line 65, the string `tmp` is extended in a nested manner, possibly leading to additional overhead during construction and checking.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the behavior observed, here are some performance-characterizing invariants:

1. **Invariant on Number of Calls to `check`:**
   - **Natural Language:** "If the main loop iterates over a length proportional to the number of binary digits of \( n \), and each iteration calls the function `check` multiple times, it can lead to a significant slowdown."
   - **Justification:** This is because each call to `check` involves complex logic that performs loop operations based on the binary representation of the numbers involved.

2. **Invariant on Growth of Binary String:**
   - **Natural Language:** "When the loop constructs binary strings whose length approaches the number of bits in the largest input number, the overhead from binary string manipulation can increase significantly."
   - **Justification:** The operations on binary strings and their comparisons become more frequent and expensive as the size of the input grows.

3. **Invariant on Nested Loop Iterations:**
   - **Natural Language:** "If the nested loops inside the `check` function execute more frequently due to the structure of the loop conditions, the performance may degrade."
   - **Justification:** The inner loops in `check` have conditions that depend on the length of the binary string, causing more iterations and adding computational cost.

4. **Invariant on Binary Representation Length:**
   - **Natural Language:** "When the length of the binary representation of \( n \) increases, each iteration of the outer loop results in a cumulative increase in computational effort due to repeated evaluations inside `check`."
   - **Justification:** As the number of bits in \( n \) increases, the function's complexity grows exponentially with operations dependent on the binary length.

These invariants reflect realistic triggers for performance issues given the constraints and should help identify similar bottlenecks in future scenarios without relying on specific input values.

### Phase 3: Implementing the Natural Language Invariants in C++

Let's implement the checkers for the performance-characterizing invariants that were derived earlier:

1. **Invariant on Number of Calls to `check`:**
   - We will check if the length of the binary representation of `n` implies a large number of calls to `check`.

```cpp
void check_number_of_calls_invariant(int numCalls) {
    if (numCalls > 1000) { // Arbitrary threshold for demonstration
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck triggered - excessive calls to check function!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

2. **Invariant on Growth of Binary String:**
   - This check will monitor the length of the binary strings used inside the loop.

```cpp
void check_binary_length_invariant(int len, int maxLen) {
    if (len > maxLen) { // Arbitrary threshold based on practical expectations
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck triggered - binary string length too large!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

3. **Invariant on Nested Loop Iterations:**
   - We will check if nested loop iterations are exceeding a reasonable count.

```cpp
void check_nested_loop_invariant(int loopIterations) {
    if (loopIterations > 10000) { // Arbitrary threshold
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck triggered - excessive nested loop iterations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

4. **Invariant on Binary Representation Length:**
   - This check ensures that the length of the binary representation does not lead to excessive operations.

```cpp
void check_binary_representation_invariant(int binaryLength) {
    if (binaryLength > 60) { // Assuming 60 is a practical limit in this context
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck triggered - binary representation length too long!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrating Checkers with the Original Program

Now, we'll integrate these checks into the original C++ program strategically to catch performance bottlenecks.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
long long n, k, m, dp[100][2];
string s, ans1;

long long check(string s, string lim) {
    int len = s.length();
    long long ans = 0;
    if (s[len - 1] == '0') {
        for (int i = len; i < m; i++) {
            ans += 2 * (1LL << (i - len));
        }
        s = s.substr(0, len - 1);
        len--;
    } else {
        for (int i = len; i < m; i++) {
            ans += (1LL << (i - len));
        }
    }
    int kt = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
        if (s[i] != lim[i]) {
            if (s[i] < lim[i]) {
                kt = 1;
            } else {
                kt = 2;
            }
            break;
        }
    }
    if (kt == 0) {
        memset(dp, 0, sizeof dp);
        dp[len][1] = 1;
        for (int i = len + 1; i <= m; i++) {
            for (int cs = 0; cs <= 1; cs++) {
                if (cs == lim[i - 1] - 48) {
                    dp[i][1] += dp[i - 1][1];
                }
                if (cs < lim[i - 1] - 48) {
                    dp[i][0] += dp[i - 1][1];
                }
                dp[i][0] += dp[i - 1][0];
            }
        }
        ans += dp[m][0] + dp[m][1];
    } else {
        if (kt == 1) {
            ans += (1LL << (m - len));
        }
    }
    return ans;
}

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
    cin.tie(0);
    cout.tie(0);
    cin >> n >> k;

    long long tmp1 = n, ans = 0;
    int binaryLength = 0;
    while (tmp1 > 0) {
        s = (char)(tmp1 % 2 + 48) + s;
        tmp1 /= 2;
        binaryLength++;
    }

    m = s.length();

    // Check for binary representation length
    check_binary_representation_invariant(binaryLength);

    int numberOfCallsToCheck = 0;
    for (int len = 1; len <= m; len++) {
        string tmp;
        while (tmp.length() < len) tmp += "0";

        // Check for binary string length within the loop
        check_binary_length_invariant(len, 60);

        for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
            tmp[i] = '1';
            if (check(tmp, s) < k) {
                tmp[i] = '0';
            }
            numberOfCallsToCheck++;
        }

        if (check(tmp, s) >= k) {
            long long tmp1 = 0;
            for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
                tmp1 = 2 * tmp1 + tmp[i] - 48;
            }
            ans = max(ans, tmp1);
        }
    }

    // Check number of calls made to check function
    check_number_of_calls_invariant(numberOfCallsToCheck);

    cout << ans;
}
```

### Explanation:
- **check_number_of_calls_invariant:** Integrated after the loop to monitor the number of times `check` is invoked.
- **check_binary_length_invariant:** Added inside the loop to monitor binary string lengths dynamically.
- **check_binary_representation_invariant:** Checked after determining the binary length of `n`.
- These checks are placed to ensure they don't add unnecessary overhead by being inside tight loops but before costly operations.
