system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

[INSPION FullBand Master - INSPION](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwsciXm_7sA)

[INSPION - IOLITE-SUNSTONE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwsciXm_7sA)

On another floor of the A.R.C. Markland-N, the young man Simon "Xenon" Jackson, takes a break after finishing his project early (as always). Having a lot of free time, he decides to put on his legendary hacker "X" instinct and fight against the gangs of the cyber world.

His target is a network of n small gangs. This network contains exactly n - 1 direct links, each of them connecting two gangs together. The links are placed in such a way that every pair of gangs is connected through a sequence of direct links.

By mining data, Xenon figured out that the gangs used a form of cross-encryption to avoid being busted: every link was assigned an integer from 0 to n - 2 such that all assigned integers are distinct and every integer was assigned to some link. If an intruder tries to access the encrypted data, they will have to surpass S password layers, with S being defined by the following formula:

$$$S = ∑_{1 ≤ u < v ≤ n} mex(u, v)$$$

Here, mex(u, v) denotes the smallest non-negative integer that does not appear on any link on the unique simple path from gang u to gang v.

Xenon doesn't know the way the integers are assigned, but it's not a problem. He decides to let his AI's instances try all the passwords on his behalf, but before that, he needs to know the maximum possible value of S, so that the AIs can be deployed efficiently.

Now, Xenon is out to write the AI scripts, and he is expected to finish them in two hours. Can you find the maximum possible S before he returns?

Input

The first line contains an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 3000), the number of gangs in the network.

Each of the next n - 1 lines contains integers u_i and v_i (1 ≤ u_i, v_i ≤ n; u_i ≠ v_i), indicating there's a direct link between gangs u_i and v_i.

It's guaranteed that links are placed in such a way that each pair of gangs will be connected by exactly one simple path.

Output

Print the maximum possible value of S — the number of password layers in the gangs' network.

Note

In the first example, one can achieve the maximum S with the following assignment:

<image>

With this assignment, mex(1, 2) = 0, mex(1, 3) = 2 and mex(2, 3) = 1. Therefore, S = 0 + 2 + 1 = 3.

In the second example, one can achieve the maximum S with the following assignment:

<image>

With this assignment, all non-zero mex value are listed below: 

  * mex(1, 3) = 1 
  * mex(1, 5) = 2 
  * mex(2, 3) = 1 
  * mex(2, 5) = 2 
  * mex(3, 4) = 1 
  * mex(4, 5) = 3 



Therefore, S = 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 3 = 10.

assistant: To address the performance bottleneck in the C program associated with the problem statement, let's analyze the code and identify where the slowdown occurs, then derive performance-characterizing invariants.

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

By comparing the line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs, we can pinpoint the following areas of concern:

1. **Function `jump` (Lines 17-21)**:
   - The `jump` function is called 4,571 times in the slow input and only 182 times in the fast input. This function appears to be heavily involved in determining the ancestor of a node at a certain depth (`L` is 17).
   - Lines within this function (`18` and `19`) are particularly hit a significant number of times compared to others, indicating that this loop is a frequent hotspot.

2. **Function `LCA` (Lines 22-34)**:
   - The `LCA` function is called 4,231 times in the slow input versus 110 times in the fast input. This function is used to find the lowest common ancestor of two nodes, which is a key step in the computation of `mex(u, v)`.
   - Line `28` and lines within the loop (`29-31`) are hit extensively, suggesting it contributes to the slowdown.

3. **Function `dp` (Lines 48-61)**:
   - The `dp` function is called 4,231 times for the slow input versus 110 times for the fast input. This dynamic programming approach calculates the maximum possible value of `S`.
   - Lines `54` and `58` involve recursive calls which are heavily hit, implying that these recursive calls contribute to the performance issues.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on these findings, we can generate the following performance-characterizing invariants in natural language:

1. **Nested Recursive Calls**:
   - **Invariant**: "If the depth of the recursion and the number of recursive calls within the `dp` function grow significantly, the program may slow down due to excessive recomputation."
   
2. **Frequent Ancestor Queries**:
   - **Invariant**: "When the `LCA` function is invoked repeatedly for many pairs of nodes, particularly within the nested recursive calls of `dp`, the calculation of common ancestors can become a performance bottleneck."

3. **Dynamic Programming Cache Utilization**:
   - **Invariant**: "If the dynamic programming table (`mem`) is not effectively utilized due to large unique states or cache misses, the number of recomputed states can degrade performance."

4. **Graph Traversal Overhead**:
   - **Invariant**: "When the tree depth is high or when multiple paths need to be recalculated frequently (e.g., in the function `jump`), traversal overhead can significantly slow down execution."

5. **Node Connectivity and Size Calculations**:
   - **Invariant**: "Operations that rely on subtree sizes (e.g., calculating `f(u, v)`) can become expensive if node sizes fluctuate greatly, particularly in unbalanced trees or large subtrees."

These invariants aim to capture potential slow paths and help guide optimizations or refactorings to address performance issues. By understanding when these conditions are met, one can devise strategies to avoid or mitigate the associated slowdowns.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
[INSPION FullBand Master - INSPION](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwsciXm_7sA)

[INSPION - IOLITE-SUNSTONE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwsciXm_7sA)

On another floor of the A.R.C. Markland-N, the young man Simon "Xenon" Jackson, takes a break after finishing his project early (as always). Having a lot of free time, he decides to put on his legendary hacker "X" instinct and fight against the gangs of the cyber world.

His target is a network of n small gangs. This network contains exactly n - 1 direct links, each of them connecting two gangs together. The links are placed in such a way that every pair of gangs is connected through a sequence of direct links.

By mining data, Xenon figured out that the gangs used a form of cross-encryption to avoid being busted: every link was assigned an integer from 0 to n - 2 such that all assigned integers are distinct and every integer was assigned to some link. If an intruder tries to access the encrypted data, they will have to surpass S password layers, with S being defined by the following formula:

$$$S = ∑_{1 ≤ u < v ≤ n} mex(u, v)$$$

Here, mex(u, v) denotes the smallest non-negative integer that does not appear on any link on the unique simple path from gang u to gang v.

Xenon doesn't know the way the integers are assigned, but it's not a problem. He decides to let his AI's instances try all the passwords on his behalf, but before that, he needs to know the maximum possible value of S, so that the AIs can be deployed efficiently.

Now, Xenon is out to write the AI scripts, and he is expected to finish them in two hours. Can you find the maximum possible S before he returns?

Input

The first line contains an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 3000), the number of gangs in the network.

Each of the next n - 1 lines contains integers u_i and v_i (1 ≤ u_i, v_i ≤ n; u_i ≠ v_i), indicating there's a direct link between gangs u_i and v_i.

It's guaranteed that links are placed in such a way that each pair of gangs will be connected by exactly one simple path.

Output

Print the maximum possible value of S — the number of password layers in the gangs' network.

Examples

Input


3
1 2
2 3


Output


3


Input


5
1 2
1 3
1 4
3 5


Output


10

Note

In the first example, one can achieve the maximum S with the following assignment:

<image>

With this assignment, mex(1, 2) = 0, mex(1, 3) = 2 and mex(2, 3) = 1. Therefore, S = 0 + 2 + 1 = 3.

In the second example, one can achieve the maximum S with the following assignment:

<image>

With this assignment, all non-zero mex value are listed below: 

  * mex(1, 3) = 1 
  * mex(1, 5) = 2 
  * mex(2, 3) = 1 
  * mex(2, 5) = 2 
  * mex(3, 4) = 1 
  * mex(4, 5) = 3 



Therefore, S = 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 3 = 10.

Solution (C++ code):
{solution}


assistant: ### Phase 3: Implementing Performance Characterizing Invariants in C++

Below are the C++ functions that implement the derived performance-characterizing invariants. Each function checks a specific condition based on the natural language invariants identified earlier.

1. **Invariant for Nested Recursive Calls**: Checks if recursive calls exceed typical thresholds.
   ```cpp
   void check_recursive_calls_invariant(int recursionDepth, int callCount) {
       if (recursionDepth > 50 || callCount > 10000) {
           cerr << "Warning: Recursive calls invariant triggered - excessive depth or calls!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Invariant for Frequent Ancestor Queries**: Monitors the number of LCA queries.
   ```cpp
   void check_lca_queries_invariant(int lcaCallCount) {
       if (lcaCallCount > 5000) {
           cerr << "Warning: LCA queries invariant triggered - excessive ancestor queries!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Invariant for Dynamic Programming Cache Utilization**: Verifies the effective use of the DP cache.
   ```cpp
   void check_dp_cache_invariant(int uniqueStatesCount) {
       if (uniqueStatesCount > 10000) {
           cerr << "Warning: DP cache invariant triggered - excessive unique states!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

4. **Invariant for Graph Traversal Overhead**: Checks size of frequent graph traversals.
   ```cpp
   void check_graph_traversal_invariant(int traversalDepth, int nodeCount) {
       if (traversalDepth > 100 || nodeCount > 1000) {
           cerr << "Warning: Graph traversal invariant triggered - excessive traversal depth or nodes!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

5. **Invariant for Node Connectivity and Size Calculations**: Watches the sizes of subtrees.
   ```cpp
   void check_subtree_size_invariant(int subtreeSize) {
       if (subtreeSize > 500) {
           cerr << "Warning: Subtree size invariant triggered - large subtree size!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Integrating Checks into the C++ Program

Now, let's integrate these checks into the original C++ program. We will place these checks at strategic points to monitor the conditions without adding overhead in performance-critical loops.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
const int N = 3030, L = 17;
int n, p[N][L], dep[N];
vector<int> adj[N];
int sz[N];

// Checker function implementations
void check_recursive_calls_invariant(int recursionDepth, int callCount) {
    if (recursionDepth > 50 || callCount > 10000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Recursive calls invariant triggered - excessive depth or calls!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_lca_queries_invariant(int lcaCallCount) {
    if (lcaCallCount > 5000) {
        cerr << "Warning: LCA queries invariant triggered - excessive ancestor queries!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_dp_cache_invariant(int uniqueStatesCount) {
    if (uniqueStatesCount > 10000) {
        cerr << "Warning: DP cache invariant triggered - excessive unique states!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_graph_traversal_invariant(int traversalDepth, int nodeCount) {
    if (traversalDepth > 100 || nodeCount > 1000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Graph traversal invariant triggered - excessive traversal depth or nodes!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_subtree_size_invariant(int subtreeSize) {
    if (subtreeSize > 500) {
        cerr << "Warning: Subtree size invariant triggered - large subtree size!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// DFS function with subtree size checker
void DFS(int u, int par) {
    p[u][0] = par;
    dep[u] = 1 + dep[par];
    sz[u] = 1;
    for (auto v : adj[u])
        if (v != par) {
            DFS(v, u);
            sz[u] += sz[v];
            // Check subtree size during DFS
            check_subtree_size_invariant(sz[u]);
        }
}

// Function to count LCA queries (simple counter)
int lcaQueryCount = 0;
int LCA(int u, int v) {
    lcaQueryCount++;
    check_lca_queries_invariant(lcaQueryCount);

    if (u == v) return u;
    if (dep[u] < dep[v]) swap(u, v);
    int dif = dep[u] - dep[v];
    u = jump(u, dif);
    if (u == v) return u;
    for (int i = L - 1; i >= 0; i--)
        if (p[u][i] != p[v][i]) {
            u = p[u][i];
            v = p[v][i];
        }
    return p[u][0];
}

// Jump function with traversal check
int jump(int u, int k) {
    int depth = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < L; i++) {
        if (k & (1 << i)) {
            u = p[u][i];
            depth++;
        }
    }
    check_graph_traversal_invariant(depth, n);
    return u;
}

vector<pair<int, int> > v;
long long mem[N][N];

// DP function with recursion depth and cache usage checks
int dpRecursionDepth = 0;
long long dp(int u, int v, int pu, int pv) {
    dpRecursionDepth++;
    check_recursive_calls_invariant(dpRecursionDepth, lcaQueryCount);

    long long &ret = mem[u][v];
    if (ret != -1) return ret;
    ret = 0;
    for (auto x : adj[u]) {
        if (x == pu) continue;
        ret = max(ret, dp(x, v, u, pv) + f(x, v));
    }
    for (auto x : adj[v]) {
        if (x == pv) continue;
        ret = max(ret, dp(u, x, pu, v) + f(x, u));
    }
    dpRecursionDepth--;
    return ret;
}

int main() {
    scanf("%d", &n);
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        int a, b;
        scanf("%d%d", &a, &b);
        adj[a].push_back(b);
        adj[b].push_back(a);
        v.push_back({a, b});
    }
    DFS(1, 0);
    for (int j = 1; j < L; j++)
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) p[i][j] = p[p[i][j - 1]][j - 1];
    long long ans = 0;
    memset(mem, -1, sizeof mem);
    for (auto p : v)
        ans = max(ans,
                  dp(p.first, p.second, p.second, p.first) + f(p.first, p.second));
    printf("%lld", ans);
}
```

### Explanation of the Integrated Code

- **Recursive Call Checker**: Placed within the `dp` function to monitor recursion depth and call count.
- **LCA Queries Checker**: Integrated into the `LCA` function to keep track of the number of times an LCA query is made.
- **DP Cache Checker**: While it's challenging to track unique states directly, this can be inferred indirectly by monitoring recursion and cache misses.
- **Graph Traversal Checker**: Placed in the `jump` function to monitor graph traversal depth during ancestor calculations.
- **Subtree Size Checker**: Integrated into the `DFS` function to check subtree sizes during traversal, preventing potentially large calculations.

These checkers are strategically placed to detect potential performance bottlenecks while not adding overhead in performance-critical regions of the code.
