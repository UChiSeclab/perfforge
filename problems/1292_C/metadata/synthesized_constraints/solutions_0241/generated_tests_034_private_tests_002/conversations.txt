system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

[INSPION FullBand Master - INSPION](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwsciXm_7sA)

[INSPION - IOLITE-SUNSTONE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwsciXm_7sA)

On another floor of the A.R.C. Markland-N, the young man Simon "Xenon" Jackson, takes a break after finishing his project early (as always). Having a lot of free time, he decides to put on his legendary hacker "X" instinct and fight against the gangs of the cyber world.

His target is a network of n small gangs. This network contains exactly n - 1 direct links, each of them connecting two gangs together. The links are placed in such a way that every pair of gangs is connected through a sequence of direct links.

By mining data, Xenon figured out that the gangs used a form of cross-encryption to avoid being busted: every link was assigned an integer from 0 to n - 2 such that all assigned integers are distinct and every integer was assigned to some link. If an intruder tries to access the encrypted data, they will have to surpass S password layers, with S being defined by the following formula:

$$$S = ∑_{1 ≤ u < v ≤ n} mex(u, v)$$$

Here, mex(u, v) denotes the smallest non-negative integer that does not appear on any link on the unique simple path from gang u to gang v.

Xenon doesn't know the way the integers are assigned, but it's not a problem. He decides to let his AI's instances try all the passwords on his behalf, but before that, he needs to know the maximum possible value of S, so that the AIs can be deployed efficiently.

Now, Xenon is out to write the AI scripts, and he is expected to finish them in two hours. Can you find the maximum possible S before he returns?

Input

The first line contains an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 3000), the number of gangs in the network.

Each of the next n - 1 lines contains integers u_i and v_i (1 ≤ u_i, v_i ≤ n; u_i ≠ v_i), indicating there's a direct link between gangs u_i and v_i.

It's guaranteed that links are placed in such a way that each pair of gangs will be connected by exactly one simple path.

Output

Print the maximum possible value of S — the number of password layers in the gangs' network.

Note

In the first example, one can achieve the maximum S with the following assignment:

<image>

With this assignment, mex(1, 2) = 0, mex(1, 3) = 2 and mex(2, 3) = 1. Therefore, S = 0 + 2 + 1 = 3.

In the second example, one can achieve the maximum S with the following assignment:

<image>

With this assignment, all non-zero mex value are listed below: 

  * mex(1, 3) = 1 
  * mex(1, 5) = 2 
  * mex(2, 3) = 1 
  * mex(2, 5) = 2 
  * mex(3, 4) = 1 
  * mex(4, 5) = 3 



Therefore, S = 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 3 = 10.

assistant: ## Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

Based on the provided hit counts for the slow and fast inputs, we can identify which parts of the code are significantly more computationally expensive for the slow input. Here's the analysis:

1. **DFS Traversal (`dfs` function):**
   - The function call to `dfs` has a high hit count (2500 for slow input vs. 100 for fast input). This suggests that the depth-first search traversal explores a significantly larger number of paths or nodes in the slow input due to the structure of the input graph.

2. **Dynamic Programming (`dp` function):**
   - The `dp` function has multiple lines with significantly higher hit counts (e.g., lines 31-34 with 7252 vs. 252 hits). This implies that there are many more recursive or dynamic programming calls being made during the execution with the slow input, which might be due to complex branching or more nodes being involved in calculations.

3. **Loops Over Pairs (`for` loop in `main`):**
   - The nested loop on line 66 (2550 vs. 110 hits) processes pairs of nodes, indicating a quadratic complexity. The high computational cost on larger inputs suggests this is a significant contributor to the slowdown, particularly as `dp(i, j)` is computed for all `i` and `j`.

## Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

### Invariant 1: High Connectivity and Large Depth in DFS

**Natural Language Description:**
"If the graph connectivity results in deep recursion during DFS traversal, the computation may become very expensive. This typically occurs when the structure results in a high branching factor or when the recursion explores a large portion of the graph."

### Invariant 2: Extensive Dynamic Programming Recursion

**Natural Language Description:**
"When many pairs of nodes require dynamic programming computations due to complex interconnections, the execution may slow down significantly. This often happens when the graph structure contains multiple long paths, leading to repeated and costly calculations."

### Invariant 3: Quadratic Pairwise Computations

**Natural Language Description:**
"If there is a quadratic number of node pairs to process in nested loops, and each pair requires expensive computations, execution time may grow rapidly. This is particularly true for large graphs where many unique paths must be evaluated."

These invariants indicate that the main performance bottlenecks are related to the graph's structural complexity and the dynamic programming recursion and traversal exacerbated by the high number of node pairs processed. By focusing on these conditions, a fuzzer or performance tester can more effectively isolate slow inputs that trigger these expensive computations.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
[INSPION FullBand Master - INSPION](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwsciXm_7sA)

[INSPION - IOLITE-SUNSTONE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwsciXm_7sA)

On another floor of the A.R.C. Markland-N, the young man Simon "Xenon" Jackson, takes a break after finishing his project early (as always). Having a lot of free time, he decides to put on his legendary hacker "X" instinct and fight against the gangs of the cyber world.

His target is a network of n small gangs. This network contains exactly n - 1 direct links, each of them connecting two gangs together. The links are placed in such a way that every pair of gangs is connected through a sequence of direct links.

By mining data, Xenon figured out that the gangs used a form of cross-encryption to avoid being busted: every link was assigned an integer from 0 to n - 2 such that all assigned integers are distinct and every integer was assigned to some link. If an intruder tries to access the encrypted data, they will have to surpass S password layers, with S being defined by the following formula:

$$$S = ∑_{1 ≤ u < v ≤ n} mex(u, v)$$$

Here, mex(u, v) denotes the smallest non-negative integer that does not appear on any link on the unique simple path from gang u to gang v.

Xenon doesn't know the way the integers are assigned, but it's not a problem. He decides to let his AI's instances try all the passwords on his behalf, but before that, he needs to know the maximum possible value of S, so that the AIs can be deployed efficiently.

Now, Xenon is out to write the AI scripts, and he is expected to finish them in two hours. Can you find the maximum possible S before he returns?

Input

The first line contains an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 3000), the number of gangs in the network.

Each of the next n - 1 lines contains integers u_i and v_i (1 ≤ u_i, v_i ≤ n; u_i ≠ v_i), indicating there's a direct link between gangs u_i and v_i.

It's guaranteed that links are placed in such a way that each pair of gangs will be connected by exactly one simple path.

Output

Print the maximum possible value of S — the number of password layers in the gangs' network.

Examples

Input


3
1 2
2 3


Output


3


Input


5
1 2
1 3
1 4
3 5


Output


10

Note

In the first example, one can achieve the maximum S with the following assignment:

<image>

With this assignment, mex(1, 2) = 0, mex(1, 3) = 2 and mex(2, 3) = 1. Therefore, S = 0 + 2 + 1 = 3.

In the second example, one can achieve the maximum S with the following assignment:

<image>

With this assignment, all non-zero mex value are listed below: 

  * mex(1, 3) = 1 
  * mex(1, 5) = 2 
  * mex(2, 3) = 1 
  * mex(2, 5) = 2 
  * mex(3, 4) = 1 
  * mex(4, 5) = 3 



Therefore, S = 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 3 = 10.

Solution (C++ code):

assistant: ## Phase 3: Implement Invariants as Checker Code in C++

Based on the performance-characterizing invariants derived, here's the C++ code to implement runtime checks:

### Invariant 1: High Connectivity and Large Depth in DFS

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(int depth, int branchingFactor) {
    if (depth > 50 && branchingFactor > 10) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Invariant 2: Extensive Dynamic Programming Recursion

```cpp
void check_dp_invariant(int calculationCount) {
    if (calculationCount > 100000) {
        cerr << "Warning: dp_invariant triggered - extensive DP recursion" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Invariant 3: Quadratic Pairwise Computations

```cpp
void check_pair_computation_invariant(int n) {
    if (n * n > 1000000) {
        cerr << "Warning: pair_computation_invariant triggered - excessive pairwise processing" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

## Phase 4: Integrate Checker Code into Original C++ Program

Below is the original C++ code with the integrated runtime checks for the identified invariants:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
const int N = 3e3 + 5;
int _w;
int dis[N][N], n, head[N], siz[N], fa[N], eidx;
long long f[N][N], ans;
struct Edge {
  int nxt, to;
} edge[N << 1];

void addedge(int u, int v) {
  edge[++eidx] = (Edge){head[u], v};
  head[u] = eidx;
  edge[++eidx] = (Edge){head[v], u};
  head[v] = eidx;
}

void check_dfs_invariant(int depth, int branchingFactor) {
    if (depth > 50 && branchingFactor > 10) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void dfs(int u, int* dis) {
  siz[u] = 1;
  int branchingFactor = 0;
  for (int i = head[u]; i; i = edge[i].nxt) {
    branchingFactor++;
    if (edge[i].to != fa[u]) {
      fa[edge[i].to] = u;
      dis[edge[i].to] = dis[u] + 1;
      check_dfs_invariant(dis[edge[i].to], branchingFactor); // Check for high depth and branching
      dfs(edge[i].to, dis);
      siz[u] += siz[edge[i].to];
    }
  }
}

void check_dp_invariant(int calculationCount) {
    if (calculationCount > 100000) {
        cerr << "Warning: dp_invariant triggered - extensive DP recursion" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

long long dp(int x, int y) {
  if (~f[x][y]) return f[x][y];
  long long& res = f[x][y];
  res = 0;
  int d = dis[x][y];
  int calculations = 0;
  for (int i = head[x]; i; i = edge[i].nxt) {
    if (dis[edge[i].to][y] < d) {
      res = max(res, dp(edge[i].to, y));
      calculations++;
    }
  }
  for (int i = head[y]; i; i = edge[i].nxt) {
    if (dis[edge[i].to][x] < d) {
      res = max(res, dp(x, edge[i].to));
      calculations++;
    }
  }
  check_dp_invariant(calculations); // Check for extensive DP recursion

  int fx = fa[x], fy = fa[y], a = 0, b = 0;
  if (dis[fx][y] < d)
    a = siz[x];
  else {
    for (int i = head[x]; i; i = edge[i].nxt)
      if (dis[edge[i].to][y] < d && edge[i].to != fx) a = n - siz[edge[i].to];
  }
  if (dis[fy][x] < d)
    b = siz[y];
  else {
    for (int i = head[y]; i; i = edge[i].nxt)
      if (dis[edge[i].to][x] < d && edge[i].to != fy) b = n - siz[edge[i].to];
  }
  res += a * b;
  return res;
}

void check_pair_computation_invariant(int n) {
    if (n * n > 1000000) {
        cerr << "Warning: pair_computation_invariant triggered - excessive pairwise processing" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main(void) {
  _w = scanf("%d", &n);
  for (int i = 1, u, v; i < n; ++i) {
    _w = scanf("%d%d", &u, &v);
    addedge(u, v);
  }
  memset(f, -1, sizeof f);
  memset(dis, 0x3f, sizeof dis);
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
    f[i][i] = 0;
    fa[i] = 0;
    dis[i][i] = 0;
    dfs(i, dis[i]);
  }
  
  check_pair_computation_invariant(n); // Check pairwise computations before heavy loop
  
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i)
    for (int j = 1; j <= n; ++j) ans = max(ans, dp(i, j));
  
  cout << ans;
  return 0;
}
```

### Explanation
- **DFS Invariant Check:** The `check_dfs_invariant` function is called within the `dfs` function to monitor the recursion depth and branching factor.
- **DP Invariant Check:** The `check_dp_invariant` function is added in the `dp` function to track the number of recursive calculations.
- **Pair Computation Check:** The `check_pair_computation_invariant` function is added in the `main` function to ensure the program does not excessively compute pairs. 

By integrating these checks into the C++ code, the program can now detect performance bottlenecks related to these specific invariants.
