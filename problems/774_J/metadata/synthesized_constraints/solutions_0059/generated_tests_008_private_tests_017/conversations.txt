system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

Well, the series which Stepan watched for a very long time, ended. In total, the series had n episodes. For each of them, Stepan remembers either that he definitely has watched it, or that he definitely hasn't watched it, or he is unsure, has he watched this episode or not. 

Stepan's dissatisfaction is the maximum number of consecutive series that Stepan did not watch.

Your task is to determine according to Stepan's memories if his dissatisfaction could be exactly equal to k.

Input

The first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 0 ≤ k ≤ n) — the number of episodes in the series and the dissatisfaction which should be checked. 

The second line contains the sequence which consists of n symbols "Y", "N" and "?". If the i-th symbol equals "Y", Stepan remembers that he has watched the episode number i. If the i-th symbol equals "N", Stepan remembers that he hasn't watched the epizode number i. If the i-th symbol equals "?", Stepan doesn't exactly remember if he has watched the episode number i or not.

Output

If Stepan's dissatisfaction can be exactly equal to k, then print "YES" (without qoutes). Otherwise print "NO" (without qoutes).

Examples

Input

5 2
NYNNY


Output

YES


Input

6 1
????NN


Output

NO

Note

In the first test Stepan remembers about all the episodes whether he has watched them or not. His dissatisfaction is 2, because he hasn't watch two episodes in a row — the episode number 3 and the episode number 4. The answer is "YES", because k = 2.

In the second test k = 1, Stepan's dissatisfaction is greater than or equal to 2 (because he remembers that he hasn't watch at least two episodes in a row — number 5 and number 6), even if he has watched the episodes from the first to the fourth, inclusive.

(F) Program Solving the Problem Statement

assistant: To address the problem of performance bottlenecks in the provided C program, we need to analyze the line-level hit counts associated with both the slow and fast inputs, and then derive performance-characterizing invariants that explain when and why the code slows down.

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Comparison of Hit Counts**: 
   - The loop starting at line 8 is hit 91 times for the slow input but only once for the fast input. This suggests that the outer loop is iterating significantly more times for the slow input.
   - Inside this loop, the nested loop on line 10 is executed 8190 times for the slow input compared to only twice for the fast input, indicating that this is a major contributor to the slowdown.
   - The condition checks and operations within these loops (lines 11-22) show similar inflated counts for the slow input.

2. **Pinpointing Key Lines**:
   - The most significant lines are 10 (the nested loop) and 16 (another nested loop), both contributing heavily to the increased execution time due to their high hit counts.
   - Line 11's condition and line 12's operation are also critical as they are executed 8100 times for the slow input, reflecting how often '?' characters are processed and potentially converted to 'N'.

3. **Interaction with Data Structures**:
   - The main data structure of concern is the string `s`, which is copied multiple times (line 9) and processed extensively within the loops.
   - The key inefficiency lies in how many '?' characters are processed for different values of `i` and `k`, leading to repeated operations where the loop checks and modifies the string unnecessarily.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

From the analysis, we can derive the following performance invariants:

1. **Invariant 1: High Number of '?' Characters with Low `k`**:
   - **Natural Language Description**: "If the number of '?' characters is high relative to the length of the series and `k` is low, the program may slow down due to excessive iterations over possible configurations."
   - **Explanation**: The program's efficiency decreases when it must consider many possible configurations for converting '?' to 'N', especially when `k` is small, leading to many unnecessary checks.

2. **Invariant 2: Multiple '?' and Small Segments of 'N's**:
   - **Natural Language Description**: "When there are several '?' characters interspersed among segments of 'N's, and `k` is small, the program may enter a slow path due to repeated attempts to forcefully create consecutive 'N' sequences."
   - **Explanation**: The hit counts suggest that excessive processing occurs when there are frequent transitions between '?' and 'N', causing the nested loops to execute repeatedly as the program tries to satisfy the condition `ans == k`.

3. **Invariant 3: Redundant Copy Operations**:
   - **Natural Language Description**: "The program will slow down significantly if there is frequent copying of the string `s` when iterating over its positions, especially when there are many uncertain episodes ('?')."
   - **Explanation**: Each iteration involves copying `s` to `t` (line 9), leading to increased memory operations that contribute to the overall slowdown.

These invariants suggest focusing on reducing unnecessary iterations and copies when '?' is prevalent and `k` is low, thereby optimizing performance for scenarios falling into these categories.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
Well, the series which Stepan watched for a very long time, ended. In total, the series had n episodes. For each of them, Stepan remembers either that he definitely has watched it, or that he definitely hasn't watched it, or he is unsure, has he watched this episode or not. 

Stepan's dissatisfaction is the maximum number of consecutive series that Stepan did not watch.

Your task is to determine according to Stepan's memories if his dissatisfaction could be exactly equal to k.

Input

The first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 0 ≤ k ≤ n) — the number of episodes in the series and the dissatisfaction which should be checked. 

The second line contains the sequence which consists of n symbols "Y", "N" and "?". If the i-th symbol equals "Y", Stepan remembers that he has watched the episode number i. If the i-th symbol equals "N", Stepan remembers that he hasn't watched the epizode number i. If the i-th symbol equals "?", Stepan doesn't exactly remember if he has watched the episode number i or not.

Output

If Stepan's dissatisfaction can be exactly equal to k, then print "YES" (without qoutes). Otherwise print "NO" (without qoutes).

Examples

Input

5 2
NYNNY


Output

YES


Input

6 1
????NN


Output

NO

Note

In the first test Stepan remembers about all the episodes whether he has watched them or not. His dissatisfaction is 2, because he hasn't watch two episodes in a row — the episode number 3 and the episode number 4. The answer is "YES", because k = 2.

In the second test k = 1, Stepan's dissatisfaction is greater than or equal to 2 (because he remembers that he hasn't watch at least two episodes in a row — number 5 and number 6), even if he has watched the episodes from the first to the fourth, inclusive.

Solution (C++ code):
{solution}


assistant: ### Phase 3: Implement the Natural Language Invariants in C++

Based on the performance-characterizing invariants derived earlier, here are the corresponding C++ checker code snippets:

1. **Invariant 1: High Number of '?' Characters with Low `k`**:
   ```cpp
   void check_question_marks_low_k(int questionMarkCount, long long k) {
       if (questionMarkCount > 10 && k <= 1) { // Example threshold for '?'
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high '?' count with low k!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Invariant 2: Multiple '?' and Small Segments of 'N's**:
   ```cpp
   void check_interspersed_question_marks(string &s, long long k) {
       int questionMarkStreak = 0;
       bool interspersedFlag = false;
       for (char c : s) {
           if (c == '?') {
               questionMarkStreak++;
           } else if (c == 'N' && questionMarkStreak > 0) {
               interspersedFlag = true;
               break;
           } else {
               questionMarkStreak = 0;
           }
       }
       if (interspersedFlag && k <= 1) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - '?' interspersed with 'N'!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Invariant 3: Redundant Copy Operations**:
   ```cpp
   void check_redundant_copy_operations(string &s) {
       int questionMarkCount = count(s.begin(), s.end(), '?');
       if (questionMarkCount > 20) { // Example threshold for redundant copy concern
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - potential redundant string copies!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Integrate the Checkers into the Program

Here is the instrumented C++ code with the integrated performance checkers:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Checker function for high '?' count with low k
void check_question_marks_low_k(int questionMarkCount, long long k) {
    if (questionMarkCount > 10 && k <= 1) { // Example threshold
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high '?' count with low k!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Checker function for interspersed '?' and 'N's
void check_interspersed_question_marks(string &s, long long k) {
    int questionMarkStreak = 0;
    bool interspersedFlag = false;
    for (char c : s) {
        if (c == '?') {
            questionMarkStreak++;
        } else if (c == 'N' && questionMarkStreak > 0) {
            interspersedFlag = true;
            break;
        } else {
            questionMarkStreak = 0;
        }
    }
    if (interspersedFlag && k <= 1) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - '?' interspersed with 'N'!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Checker function for redundant copy operations
void check_redundant_copy_operations(string &s) {
    int questionMarkCount = count(s.begin(), s.end(), '?');
    if (questionMarkCount > 20) { // Example threshold
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - potential redundant string copies!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    long long n, k;
    cin >> n >> k;
    string s;

### Explanation of Checker Placement
- **After Input Reading**: The checkers are placed immediately after reading the input to catch any potential slow scenarios before entering the expensive loops.
- **Avoiding Tight Loops**: The checkers are implemented outside of tight loops to prevent introducing additional overhead to the execution time.
- **Threshold Values**: The thresholds used in the checker functions are based on the performance analysis and are generalized to detect similar slow scenarios.
