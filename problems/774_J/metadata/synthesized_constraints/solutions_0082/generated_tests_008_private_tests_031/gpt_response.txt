### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Compare Line-Level Hit Counts:**
   - Line 9: The loop `for (int i = 0; i + k - 1 < n; ++i)` has 92 hits for the slow input and only 1 hit for the fast input.
   - Lines 12 and 15: These loops iterate over `n` and have hit counts of 8372 on the slow input compared to 3 on the fast input.
   - The nested loop structure is causing a significant increase in operations for the slow input.
   - Lines 29-31: The `while (i < n && cur[i] == 'N')` loop executes 6554 times for the slow input versus only 1 time for the fast input.

2. **Pinpoint Lines or Functions with More Hits:**
   - The nested loop structure and the repeated copying and modification of arrays (lines 12-22) are inefficient.
   - The `while` loop on line 29 iterating over `cur` when it's filled with 'N's is particularly expensive.

3. **Infer Interactions with Data Structures and Input Constraints:**
   - The expensive operations correlate with the number of unknown episodes ('?') in the sequence. This results in many iterations within nested loops.
   - The structure of the `for` loop (lines 12-22) that reprocesses the entire array `cur` results in many redundant operations, especially when '?' is present.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **Natural Language Performance Invariants:**

   - **Invariant 1: Excessive Iterations Over Large Segments**
     - "If the sequence contains a large number of consecutive episodes marked as unknown ('?'), the program may enter a slow path due to excessive iterations over possible combinations of watched and not watched episodes."

   - **Invariant 2: Redundant Array Processing**
     - "If there are many unknown episodes, leading to frequent recomputation of possible watched sequences across the array, the performance may degrade significantly."

   - **Invariant 3: Intensive Examination of Long Unwatched Streaks**
     - "A sequence with a long segment of consecutive 'N's, especially when interspersed with '?', can lead to an increased number of operations as each potential streak is examined thoroughly."

2. **Thresholds and Patterns:**
   - **Thresholds for Inefficiency:**
     - The inefficiency is particularly pronounced when the sequence length approaches the maximum constraint (`n = 100`) and contains a significant number of '?' characters.
   - **Pattern Recognition:**
     - Sequences with clusters of '?' combined with long stretches of 'N' can lead to redundant operations due to the nested loops and while loops re-evaluating similar conditions multiple times.

3. **Generalization for Future Inputs:**
   - These conditions highlight that future inputs resulting in a high concentration of '?' characters can guide the program down inefficient paths. Specifically, inputs where '?' is prominent in conjunction with 'N' sequences can be challenging for performance.

By recognizing the patterns above, we can improve the performance of the code by focusing on minimizing redundant operations, especially when dealing with unknown episodes. This approach provides insight into the conditions that lead to inefficient execution, helping to optimize the program for a wider range of inputs.

### Phase 3: Implementing the Natural Language Invariants in C++

Below, each invariant is translated into a C++ checker function that can be used to detect performance bottlenecks at runtime:

1. **Invariant 1: Excessive Iterations Over Large Segments**
   ```cpp
   void check_excessive_iterations(const std::string &str) {
       int questionCount = std::count(str.begin(), str.end(), '?');
       if (questionCount > 30) { // Arbitrarily chosen threshold for demonstration
           std::cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to excessive '?' characters in sequence." << std::endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Invariant 2: Redundant Array Processing**
   ```cpp
   void check_redundant_processing(const std::string &str) {
       if (str.size() > 80 && std::count(str.begin(), str.end(), '?') > 20) { // Arbitrary thresholds
           std::cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to redundant processing of '?' in long sequences." << std::endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Invariant 3: Intensive Examination of Long Unwatched Streaks**
   ```cpp
   void check_long_unwatched_streaks(const std::string &str) {
       int maxConsecutiveN = 0, currentN = 0;
       for (char c : str) {
           if (c == 'N') {
               currentN++;
               if (currentN > maxConsecutiveN) maxConsecutiveN = currentN;
           } else {
               currentN = 0;
           }
       }
       if (maxConsecutiveN > 20) { // Arbitrary threshold
           std::cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to long streaks of 'N'." << std::endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Integrating the Checkers into the Original Program

Integrate these checker functions into the given C++ program by placing them strategically to avoid additional overhead in tight loops.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>

void check_excessive_iterations(const std::string &str) {
    int questionCount = std::count(str.begin(), str.end(), '?');
    if (questionCount > 30) { // Arbitrarily chosen threshold for demonstration
        std::cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to excessive '?' characters in sequence." << std::endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_redundant_processing(const std::string &str) {
    if (str.size() > 80 && std::count(str.begin(), str.end(), '?') > 20) { // Arbitrary thresholds
        std::cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to redundant processing of '?' in long sequences." << std::endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_long_unwatched_streaks(const std::string &str) {
    int maxConsecutiveN = 0, currentN = 0;
    for (char c : str) {
        if (c == 'N') {
            currentN++;
            if (currentN > maxConsecutiveN) maxConsecutiveN = currentN;
        } else {
            currentN = 0;
        }
    }
    if (maxConsecutiveN > 20) { // Arbitrary threshold
        std::cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to long streaks of 'N'." << std::endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    int n, k;
    scanf("%d", &n);
    scanf("%d", &k);
    char str[101];
    scanf("%s", str);
    
    std::string series(str);

    // Apply the performance checks after input
    check_excessive_iterations(series);
    check_redundant_processing(series);
    check_long_unwatched_streaks(series);

    char cur[101];
    for (int i = 0; i + k - 1 < n; ++i) {
        int j = i + k - 1;
        for (int l = 0; l < n; ++l) {
            cur[l] = str[l];
        }
        for (int l = 0; l < n; ++l) {
            if (i <= l && l <= j) {
                if (str[l] == '?') {
                    cur[l] = 'N';
                }
            } else {
                if (str[l] == '?') {
                    cur[l] = 'Y';
                }
            }
        }
        int mx = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            int cnt = 0;
            while (i < n && cur[i] == 'N') {
                ++cnt;
                ++i;
            }
            if (cnt > 0) {
                --i;
                if (cnt > mx) {
                    mx = cnt;
                }
            }
        }
        if (mx == k) {
            printf("YES");
            return 0;
        }
    }
    printf("NO");
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

- **Placement of Checks:** The checks are placed right after input reading to ensure they execute before any expensive calculations or iterations.
- **Thresholds:** Arbitrary thresholds are set based on the problem constraints and expected input patterns to detect performance bottlenecks.
- **Abort on Bottlenecks:** If a bottleneck condition is detected, the program prints a warning and aborts, aiding in identifying performance issues during testing.
