### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

Based on the hit count information provided:

1. **Function Entry and Exit:**
   - The `func` function is called 29,361 times for the slow input and only 3 times for the fast input (lines 6 and 7). This indicates a recursive call structure that's much deeper or more extensive in the slow input case.

2. **Recursion End Condition:**
   - The condition `if (here == n)` (line 7) is hit 29,361 times in the slow input and only 3 times in the fast input. This suggests that the recursion depth or breadth in processing the input is a critical factor for the slow input.

3. **Character Check and Recursion:**
   - The check `if (a[here] == 'N')` (line 16) and subsequent recursion (line 17) occur 15,934 times in the slow input, while for 'Y', it occurs 15,589 times (line 18). The 'else' block (line 21) is also significantly hit for the slow input. These results highlight that the recursive function calls based on characters 'N', 'Y', and '?' significantly affect performance.

4. **Maximum Function Call in Unknown Scenario:**
   - The line `ret = max(func(...), func(...));` (line 21) is executed 13,426 times for the slow input, indicating a high number of decision branches when the character is '?', leading to a combinatorial explosion in function calls.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the observations from the hit counts, we can derive the following performance-characterizing invariants:

1. **High Recursion Depth with Uncertain Episodes:**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "If the sequence contains a large number of uncertain ('?') episodes interspersed with definite episodes ('N' or 'Y'), the recursion depth increases significantly, leading to slower execution. The combinatorial paths due to uncertainty can result in an exponential number of recursive calls."
   - **Threshold Suggestion:** When the number of '?' characters approaches n in sequences where n is large (close to 100), it results in numerous recursive explorations.

2. **Excessive Recursion Due to Consecutive Unknowns:**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "If there are long runs of consecutive unknown ('?') episodes, the recursive function might explore multiple configurations for each, significantly increasing the number of recursive calls."
   - **Threshold Suggestion:** When consecutive '?' characters exceed a third of the sequence length, the potential branching can cause a significant slowdown.

3. **Recursive Path Explosion with Mixed Characters:**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "If the sequence is composed of a mix of 'N', 'Y', and '?' with more '?' than 'N' or 'Y', the recursive exploration of possible dissatisfaction paths might become exhaustive."
   - **Threshold Suggestion:** When '?' characters form more than half of non-'Y' episodes, recursion paths multiply, impacting performance.

These invariants target the conditions under which the program's recursive nature may lead to slow performance, focusing on the interaction between 'N', 'Y', and '?' characters and their impact on recursive call paths.

### Phase 3: Implement the Natural Language Invariants as C++ Checkers

Below, I've translated the previously derived natural language invariants into C++ code snippets that can be used as runtime checks.

1. **High Recursion Depth with Uncertain Episodes:**

```cpp
void check_uncertain_invariant(int numUncertain, int n) {
    if (numUncertain > n / 2) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - too many uncertain episodes!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

2. **Excessive Recursion Due to Consecutive Unknowns:**

```cpp
void check_consecutive_unknowns_invariant(int maxConsecutiveUncertain, int n) {
    if (maxConsecutiveUncertain > n / 3) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - too many consecutive uncertain episodes!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

3. **Recursive Path Explosion with Mixed Characters:**

```cpp
void check_mixed_invariant(int numUncertain, int numY, int n) {
    if (numUncertain > (n - numY) / 2) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high mix of uncertain episodes!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrate the Checkers into the Original Program

Now, let's integrate these checkers into the original C++ code to detect potential performance bottlenecks.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int dp[110][110][110];
int n, m;
char a[110];

void check_uncertain_invariant(int numUncertain, int n) {
    if (numUncertain > n / 2) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - too many uncertain episodes!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_consecutive_unknowns_invariant(int maxConsecutiveUncertain, int n) {
    if (maxConsecutiveUncertain > n / 3) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - too many consecutive uncertain episodes!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_mixed_invariant(int numUncertain, int numY, int n) {
    if (numUncertain > (n - numY) / 2) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high mix of uncertain episodes!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int func(int here, int ch, int ch1) {
    if (here == n) {
        if (ch1 == m)
            return 1;
        else
            return 0;
    }
    int &ret = dp[here][ch][ch1];
    if (ret != -1) return ret;
    ret = 0;
    if (a[here] == 'N')
        ret = func(here + 1, ch + 1, max(ch + 1, ch1));
    else if (a[here] == 'Y')
        ret = func(here + 1, 0, ch1);
    else {
        ret = max(func(here + 1, ch + 1, max(ch + 1, ch1)), func(here + 1, 0, ch1));
    }
    return ret;
}

int main() {
    memset(dp, -1, sizeof(dp));
    scanf("%d %d", &n, &m);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) scanf(" %1c", &a[i]);
    
    // Pre-calculate conditions for the invariants
    int numUncertain = 0, maxConsecutiveUncertain = 0, currentConsecutiveUncertain = 0, numY = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (a[i] == '?') {
            numUncertain++;
            currentConsecutiveUncertain++;
        } else {
            maxConsecutiveUncertain = max(maxConsecutiveUncertain, currentConsecutiveUncertain);
            currentConsecutiveUncertain = 0;
        }
        if (a[i] == 'Y') {
            numY++;
        }
    }
    maxConsecutiveUncertain = max(maxConsecutiveUncertain, currentConsecutiveUncertain);

    // Insert performance-checking conditions
    check_uncertain_invariant(numUncertain, n);
    check_consecutive_unknowns_invariant(maxConsecutiveUncertain, n);
    check_mixed_invariant(numUncertain, numY, n);

    if (func(0, 0, 0))
        puts("YES");
    else
        puts("NO");
}
```

### Explanation

- **Checker Integration:** Each of the previously defined checkers is integrated into the `main` function just after reading and processing the input.
- **Pre-calculation:** Before invoking the checkers, the necessary conditions are pre-calculated, such as `numUncertain`, `maxConsecutiveUncertain`, and `numY`, so as to avoid additional computation within the checker functions.
- **Placement:** The checkers are placed outside tight loops or recursive functions to avoid increasing the computational overhead significantly.
