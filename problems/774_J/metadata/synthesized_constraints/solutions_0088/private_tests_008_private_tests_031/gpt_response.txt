=== Invariants Response ===
To diagnose the performance bottleneck in the given C program, we can analyze the provided hit count data and derive performance-characterizing invariants. Here's a step-by-step analysis:

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Line-level Hit Counts Analysis:**
   - The loop structure from lines 20 to 34 is heavily hit, especially on the slow input. The outer loop runs `n` times, and the two nested loops run `n+1` times each for `gap` and `mx`. This leads to a cubic complexity with respect to `n`.
   - Line 23 (`if (!dp[i][gap][mx]) continue;`) shows a significant number of skips, indicating that many states are not valid and are hence skipped.
   - Lines 30-32 involve conditions that get hit frequently, especially when processing '?' characters, which suggest multiple possible states being computed and stored in the dynamic programming table.

2. **Interaction with Data Structures:**
   - The dynamic programming array `dp` is three-dimensional with dimensions `[n][n+1][n+1]`, leading to potentially large memory usage and computation, especially when `n` approaches its upper limit.
   - Processing each '?' character leads to two potential state transitions, increasing the number of valid states considerably.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the analysis above, we can generate natural language statements that describe the conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path:

1. **Invariant #1: High State Space Exploration**
   - Natural Language Description: "When `n` is large (close to 100) and the input contains a high number of '?' characters, the program explores a large number of possible states, leading to increased computation time."
   - This is due to the fact that each '?' can either be a 'Y' or 'N', exponentially increasing the state space that the DP array needs to consider.

2. **Invariant #2: Expensive Nested Loop Execution**
   - Natural Language Description: "The cubic complexity of the nested loops results in slower performance when `n` is near its upper limit of 100, due to the repeated processing of a large state space."
   - This describes the inefficiency inherent in the nested loop structure, exacerbated by large inputs.

3. **Invariant #3: Memory Usage with Large DP Table**
   - Natural Language Description: "Memory usage spikes when `n` is close to 100 due to the large dimensions of the DP table, impacting performance."
   - This captures the increased memory footprint and potential cache inefficiency when the DP table size is large.

These invariants help in understanding the performance triggers in the code. They abstractly capture conditions that are likely to lead to slow execution without relying on specific numeric input values, aligning with the constraint of `n <= 100`.

### Phase 3: Implementing Natural Language Invariants in C++

For each performance-characterizing invariant derived earlier, we will create a checker function in C++ that can detect the condition at runtime:

1. **Invariant for High State Space Exploration:**
   - Natural Language Description: "When `n` is large (close to 100) and the input contains a high number of '?' characters, the program explores a large number of possible states, leading to increased computation time."
   - C++ Checker Implementation:
   ```cpp
   void check_high_state_space(int n, int questionMarkCount) {
       if (n > 80 && questionMarkCount > 30) {
           cerr << "Warning: High state space exploration triggered!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Invariant for Expensive Nested Loop Execution:**
   - Natural Language Description: "The cubic complexity of the nested loops results in slower performance when `n` is near its upper limit of 100, due to the repeated processing of a large state space."
   - C++ Checker Implementation:
   ```cpp
   void check_expensive_nested_loops(int n) {
       if (n > 90) {
           cerr << "Warning: Expensive nested loops triggered!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Invariant for Memory Usage with Large DP Table:**
   - Natural Language Description: "Memory usage spikes when `n` is close to 100 due to the large dimensions of the DP table, impacting performance."
   - C++ Checker Implementation:
   ```cpp
   void check_large_dp_table(int n) {
       if (n > 90) {
           cerr << "Warning: Large DP table memory usage triggered!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Integrating Checkers into the Original Program

Now we'll incorporate these checker functions into the given C++ program, ensuring to place them at strategic points in the flow to avoid unnecessary overhead.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Checker functions
void check_high_state_space(int n, int questionMarkCount) {
    if (n > 80 && questionMarkCount > 30) {
        cerr << "Warning: High state space exploration triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_expensive_nested_loops(int n) {
    if (n > 90) {
        cerr << "Warning: Expensive nested loops triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_large_dp_table(int n) {
    if (n > 90) {
        cerr << "Warning: Large DP table memory usage triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    int n, k;
    string s;
    cin >> n >> k;
    cin >> s;
    
    // Count '?' characters in input
    int questionMarkCount = count(s.begin(), s.end(), '?');

    // Insert checks after reading inputs
    check_high_state_space(n, questionMarkCount); // Checks for high state space exploration
    check_expensive_nested_loops(n); // Checks for expensive nested loop execution
    check_large_dp_table(n); // Checks for large DP table memory usage

    s.push_back('Y');
    n++;
    bool dp[105][105][105] = {0};
    dp[0][0][0] = 1;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        for (int gap = 0; gap <= n; gap++)
            for (int mx = 0; mx <= n; mx++) {
                if (!dp[i][gap][mx]) continue;
                if (s[i] == 'Y') {
                    dp[i + 1][0][max(mx, gap)] = 1;
                }
                if (s[i] == 'N') {
                    dp[i + 1][gap + 1][mx] = 1;
                }
                if (s[i] == '?') {
                    dp[i + 1][0][max(mx, gap)] = 1;
                    dp[i + 1][gap + 1][mx] = 1;
                }
            }
    bool ans = dp[n][0][k];
    cout << (ans ? "YES" : "NO") << "\n";
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation
- **Checker Placement:** The checkers are placed after the input reading step and before any computationally intensive operations, ensuring they do not add overhead in critical sections like tight loops.
- **Thresholds & Conditions:** The thresholds (e.g., `n > 80`, `questionMarkCount > 30`) are chosen based on problem constraints, aiming to catch slow paths without being overly restrictive. These checks are designed to help identify potential performance issues during runtime, especially useful for testing and fuzzing scenarios.
