system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

Sam has been teaching Jon the Game of Stones to sharpen his mind and help him devise a strategy to fight the white walkers. The rules of this game are quite simple: 

  * The game starts with n piles of stones indexed from 1 to n. The i-th pile contains si stones.
  * The players make their moves alternatively. A move is considered as removal of some number of stones from a pile. Removal of 0 stones does not count as a move.
  * The player who is unable to make a move loses.



Now Jon believes that he is ready for battle, but Sam does not think so. To prove his argument, Sam suggested that they play a modified version of the game.

In this modified version, no move can be made more than once on a pile. For example, if 4 stones are removed from a pile, 4 stones cannot be removed from that pile again.

Sam sets up the game and makes the first move. Jon believes that Sam is just trying to prevent him from going to battle. Jon wants to know if he can win if both play optimally.

Input

First line consists of a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 106) — the number of piles.

Each of next n lines contains an integer si (1 ≤ si ≤ 60) — the number of stones in i-th pile.

Output

Print a single line containing "YES" (without quotes) if Jon wins, otherwise print "NO" (without quotes)

Examples

Input

1
5


Output

NO

Input

2

2


Output

YES

Note

In the first case, Sam removes all the stones and Jon loses.

In second case, the following moves are possible by Sam: <image>

In each of these cases, last move can be made by Jon to win the game as follows: <image>

assistant: To diagnose the performance bottlenecks in the provided C program, we can follow the tasks outlined in Phase 1 and Phase 2. Let's break down the process:

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Compare Line-Level Hit Counts**:
   - We observe that the function `sg` is called numerous times for both the slow and fast inputs. The lines with the highest hit counts are within the `sg` function.
   - In particular, line 20 (`for (int(i) = (1); (i) < (st + 1); (i)++)`) and line 22 (`chk[sg(st - i, bm | (1 << i))] = 1;`) are hit significantly more often for the slow input compared to the fast input. This indicates that the recursive calls in the `sg` function are likely contributing to the slowdown.

2. **Pinpoint Lines or Functions with Significant Hits**:
   - The recursive call to `sg` (line 22) is a critical source of increased hit counts for the slow input. Each call potentially leads to a cascade of further recursive calls, increasing exponentially with the number of stones in a pile.
   - The lines involved in memoization (line 17 and line 27) are also hit frequently, suggesting that while some gains are made by caching results, the overhead of recursion remains significant.

3. **Inference with Data Structures, Loops, etc.**:
   - The `sg` function uses a bitwise representation for state management and checks with a bitset to find the Grundy number. The nested loop and recursive structure, combined with bitwise operations, result in a complex call tree which grows with larger values of `st`.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the identified bottlenecks, we can suggest the following performance-characterizing invariants:

1. **Recursive Depth and Branching**:
   - **Invariant**: "If the number of stones `s_i` in any pile is large, the recursive computation in the `sg` function may lead to a deep and wide search space, causing the program to execute slowly."
   - **Explanation**: This is due to the recursive nature where each stone count can lead to multiple recursive calls, especially when `s_i` values are high.

2. **Memoization Limitations**:
   - **Invariant**: "Even with memoization, if there are many unique states due to large stone counts across all piles, the performance may degrade due to increased memory usage and cache misses."
   - **Explanation**: High variety in game states due to diverse stone counts leads to less effective caching, as many states are computed and cached, leading to potential memory and performance overhead.

3. **Bitmask Complexity**:
   - **Invariant**: "For large stone counts, the bitmask operations become more complex and the potential state space increases, possibly leading to high runtime."
   - **Explanation**: The bitmasking technique is efficient for small state spaces but grows in complexity with more bits (i.e., higher stone counts), especially when recursion multiplies the state space exploration.

### Conclusion

These invariants abstract the performance issues observed without relying on specific numeric values from the inputs. They broadly describe how recursion depth, state space complexity, and ineffective memoization can collectively contribute to slow performance, particularly when stone counts approach upper limits or create many possible game states.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
Sam has been teaching Jon the Game of Stones to sharpen his mind and help him devise a strategy to fight the white walkers. The rules of this game are quite simple: 

  * The game starts with n piles of stones indexed from 1 to n. The i-th pile contains si stones.
  * The players make their moves alternatively. A move is considered as removal of some number of stones from a pile. Removal of 0 stones does not count as a move.
  * The player who is unable to make a move loses.



Now Jon believes that he is ready for battle, but Sam does not think so. To prove his argument, Sam suggested that they play a modified version of the game.

In this modified version, no move can be made more than once on a pile. For example, if 4 stones are removed from a pile, 4 stones cannot be removed from that pile again.

Sam sets up the game and makes the first move. Jon believes that Sam is just trying to prevent him from going to battle. Jon wants to know if he can win if both play optimally.

Input

First line consists of a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 106) — the number of piles.

Each of next n lines contains an integer si (1 ≤ si ≤ 60) — the number of stones in i-th pile.

Output

Print a single line containing "YES" (without quotes) if Jon wins, otherwise print "NO" (without quotes)

Examples

Input

1
5


Output

NO

Input

2
1
2


Output

YES

Note

In the first case, Sam removes all the stones and Jon loses.

In second case, the following moves are possible by Sam: <image>

In each of these cases, last move can be made by Jon to win the game as follows: <image>

Solution (C++ code):
{solution}


assistant: ### Phase 3: Implement the Natural Language Invariants in C++

Based on the natural language invariants derived in Phase 2, here's how to implement runtime checks for those invariants:

1. **Recursive Depth and Branching Check**:
   - Condition: If the number of stones in a pile (`s_i`) is large, the recursion depth and the number of recursive calls can become significant, causing slowdowns.

2. **Memoization Limitations Check**:
   - Condition: If a large number of unique states are generated due to high stone counts, the memoization might be less effective.

3. **Bitmask Complexity Check**:
   - Condition: When the stone counts are high, the complexity of bitmask operations increases, potentially leading to a performance bottleneck.

Here is the C++ checker code for these conditions:

```cpp
void check_recursion_depth(int stones) {
    if (stones > 30) { // Arbitrarily chosen threshold for high recursion depth
        cerr << "Warning: Recursion depth may be excessive due to high stone count." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_memorization_state_size(int uniqueStates) {
    if (uniqueStates > 100000) { // Threshold for an excessive number of states
        cerr << "Warning: Memorization may become inefficient due to many unique states." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_bitmask_complexity(int stones) {
    if (stones > 40) { // Threshold for complex bitmask operations
        cerr << "Warning: Bitmask operations may be complex due to high stone count." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrate Checkers into the Original Program

Now, we integrate these checks into the original C++ code at appropriate places to ensure they do not degrade performance further, such as before entering the recursive function or after input is read.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

const int INF = 1000000007;
int n, num, x;
map<pair<int, long long>, int> m;

void check_recursion_depth(int stones) {
    if (stones > 30) { // Arbitrarily chosen threshold for high recursion depth
        cerr << "Warning: Recursion depth may be excessive due to high stone count." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_memorization_state_size(int uniqueStates) {
    if (uniqueStates > 100000) { // Threshold for an excessive number of states
        cerr << "Warning: Memorization may become inefficient due to many unique states." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_bitmask_complexity(int stones) {
    if (stones > 40) { // Threshold for complex bitmask operations
        cerr << "Warning: Bitmask operations may be complex due to high stone count." << endl;
        abort();

### Explanation:
- **Recursion Depth Check** is placed after reading each pile's stone count to ensure that high recursion depth is flagged early.
- **Bitmask Complexity Check** is also placed after reading each pile's stone count to catch potential complexity before processing.
- **Memoization State Size Check** is placed after the game state is processed to ensure that excessive states do not overwhelm the system. 

These checks help identify potential slowdowns due to recursion depth, state space size, and bitmask complexity, and integrate them efficiently to detect performance issues.
