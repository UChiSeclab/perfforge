=== Invariants Response ===
Considering the provided context, code, and hit count information, let's go through the phases to analyze the performance bottleneck and derive performance-characterizing invariants.

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments
1. **Hit Count Analysis:**
   - **Line 18:** `while (used.find(curr) == used.end() && curr <= n / 2)` shows significantly more hits for the slow input (5029 hits compared to 70 for the fast input). This suggests the `while` loop runs many more iterations for larger `n`.
   - **Lines 19-25:** These lines also show significantly higher hit counts for the slow input, indicating the body of the loop runs many more times. This includes division operations (`n / curr` and `n / aux`), which are generally expensive.

2. **Data Structure Interaction:**
   - The loop maintains sets `ans` and `used` which are continuously inserted into. Inserting into sets can be costly due to the need to maintain order and uniqueness.
   - The condition `curr <= n / 2` increases the loop's potential iterations, especially for larger `n`.

3. **Problem Specific Constraints:**
   - The problem states `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9`, which means `n` could be very large, leading to many iterations in the while loop, exacerbating performance issues.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants
Based on the above analysis, here are some performance-characterizing invariants in natural language:

1. **Invariant 1: Large `n` and Division Operations**
   - **Description:** When `n` is large, the program performs many division operations within a loop, causing a performance bottleneck. The condition `curr <= n / 2` allows the loop to execute many times, especially for larger values of `n`.
   - **Threshold:** If `n` is near the upper constraint (`n ≈ 10^9`), the loop's division operations become the performance bottleneck.

2. **Invariant 2: Set Insert Operations**
   - **Description:** If the loop frequently inserts into the `used` and `ans` sets, it can degrade performance. The operations are relatively costly due to maintaining order and uniqueness.
   - **Threshold:** When `n` allows `curr` to reach values close to `n/2`, the program potentially makes excessive insert operations, slowing down the execution.

3. **Invariant 3: Loop Execution Count**
   - **Description:** As `curr` iterates over values that cover a significant range from `2` to `n/2`, the loop executes many times. The computational load increases with the number of loop iterations.
   - **Threshold:** When `curr` iterates over a large range, the number of iterations and associated operations can lead to performance degradation.

These invariants help identify conditions under which the program may slow down, particularly due to the computational cost of frequent division and insert operations in a loop that can iterate many times for large `n`. By monitoring these conditions, one can preemptively identify potential performance issues with similar input patterns in the future.

=== Checker Response ===
### Phase 3: Implementing Natural Language Invariants as C++ Checkers

Let's translate the performance-characterizing invariants from Phase 2 into C++ checker functions. We'll use the template provided to formulate these checks.

1. **Invariant 1: Large `n` and Division Operations**

   ```cpp
   void check_large_n_divisions(long long n, long long curr) {
       if (n >= 1e9 && curr > n / 1000) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to large n causing too many division operations!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Invariant 2: Set Insert Operations**

   ```cpp
   void check_frequent_set_insertions(long long n, long long curr, const set<long long>& used) {
       if (used.size() > 100000 && curr > n / 1000) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to frequent set insertions!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Invariant 3: Loop Execution Count**

   ```cpp
   void check_loop_execution_count(long long n, long long curr) {
       if (curr > n / 1000) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to excessive loop iterations!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Integrating Checkers with the Original Program

Now, we will integrate these checks into the given C++ code to monitor for these performance bottlenecks.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Checker for large n and excessive division operations
void check_large_n_divisions(long long n, long long curr) {
    if (n >= 1e9 && curr > n / 1000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to large n causing too many division operations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Checker for frequent set insertions
void check_frequent_set_insertions(long long n, long long curr, const set<long long>& used) {
    if (used.size() > 100000 && curr > n / 1000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to frequent set insertions!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Checker for excessive loop iterations
void check_loop_execution_count(long long n, long long curr) {
    if (curr > n / 1000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to excessive loop iterations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
    cin.tie(0);
    cout.tie(0);
    
    int t;
    cin >> t;
    while (t--) {
        long long n;
        cin >> n;
        set<long long> ans;
        set<long long> used;
        ans.insert(0);
        ans.insert(1);
        ans.insert(n);
        long long curr = 2;

        // Place checks before the loop to catch initial conditions
        check_large_n_divisions(n, curr);
        check_frequent_set_insertions(n, curr, used);
        
        while (used.find(curr) == used.end() && curr <= n / 2) {
            long long aux = n / curr;
            long long aux2 = n / aux;
            ans.insert(aux);
            ans.insert(aux2);
            used.insert(curr);
            used.insert(aux);
            
            // Check within the loop to catch dynamic conditions
            check_loop_execution_count(n, curr);
            
            curr++;
        }
        
        cout << ans.size() << "\n";
        for (auto e : ans) {
            cout << e << " ";
        }
        cout << "\n";
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

- **Placement of Checks:**
  - The checks are placed strategically before and during the loop execution to catch performance issues without introducing significant overhead.
  - The `check_large_n_divisions`, `check_frequent_set_insertions`, and `check_loop_execution_count` functions are designed to abort execution if a bottleneck condition is detected.
- **Thresholds:**
  - The thresholds in the checks are chosen to reflect the constraints of the problem and typical performance issues when dealing with large data sizes. They serve to highlight problems early on, especially with large inputs.
