system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

On the well-known testing system MathForces, a draw of n rating units is arranged. The rating will be distributed according to the following algorithm: if k participants take part in this event, then the n rating is evenly distributed between them and rounded to the nearest lower integer, At the end of the drawing, an unused rating may remain — it is not given to any of the participants.

For example, if n = 5 and k = 3, then each participant will recieve an 1 rating unit, and also 2 rating units will remain unused. If n = 5, and k = 6, then none of the participants will increase their rating.

Vasya participates in this rating draw but does not have information on the total number of participants in this event. Therefore, he wants to know what different values of the rating increment are possible to get as a result of this draw and asks you for help.

For example, if n=5, then the answer is equal to the sequence 0, 1, 2, 5. Each of the sequence values (and only them) can be obtained as ⌊ n/k ⌋ for some positive integer k (where ⌊ x ⌋ is the value of x rounded down): 0 = ⌊ 5/7 ⌋, 1 = ⌊ 5/5 ⌋, 2 = ⌊ 5/2 ⌋, 5 = ⌊ 5/1 ⌋.

Write a program that, for a given n, finds a sequence of all possible rating increments.

Input

The first line contains integer number t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10) — the number of test cases in the input. Then t test cases follow.

Each line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) — the total number of the rating units being drawn.

Output

Output the answers for each of t test cases. Each answer should be contained in two lines.

In the first line print a single integer m — the number of different rating increment values that Vasya can get.

In the following line print m integers in ascending order — the values of possible rating increments.

assistant: Considering the provided context, code, and hit count information, let's go through the phases to analyze the performance bottleneck and derive performance-characterizing invariants.

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments
1. **Hit Count Analysis:**
   - **Line 18:** `while (used.find(curr) == used.end() && curr <= n / 2)` shows significantly more hits for the slow input (5029 hits compared to 70 for the fast input). This suggests the `while` loop runs many more iterations for larger `n`.
   - **Lines 19-25:** These lines also show significantly higher hit counts for the slow input, indicating the body of the loop runs many more times. This includes division operations (`n / curr` and `n / aux`), which are generally expensive.

2. **Data Structure Interaction:**
   - The loop maintains sets `ans` and `used` which are continuously inserted into. Inserting into sets can be costly due to the need to maintain order and uniqueness.
   - The condition `curr <= n / 2` increases the loop's potential iterations, especially for larger `n`.

3. **Problem Specific Constraints:**
   - The problem states `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9`, which means `n` could be very large, leading to many iterations in the while loop, exacerbating performance issues.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants
Based on the above analysis, here are some performance-characterizing invariants in natural language:

1. **Invariant 1: Large `n` and Division Operations**
   - **Description:** When `n` is large, the program performs many division operations within a loop, causing a performance bottleneck. The condition `curr <= n / 2` allows the loop to execute many times, especially for larger values of `n`.
   - **Threshold:** If `n` is near the upper constraint (`n ≈ 10^9`), the loop's division operations become the performance bottleneck.

2. **Invariant 2: Set Insert Operations**
   - **Description:** If the loop frequently inserts into the `used` and `ans` sets, it can degrade performance. The operations are relatively costly due to maintaining order and uniqueness.
   - **Threshold:** When `n` allows `curr` to reach values close to `n/2`, the program potentially makes excessive insert operations, slowing down the execution.

3. **Invariant 3: Loop Execution Count**
   - **Description:** As `curr` iterates over values that cover a significant range from `2` to `n/2`, the loop executes many times. The computational load increases with the number of loop iterations.
   - **Threshold:** When `curr` iterates over a large range, the number of iterations and associated operations can lead to performance degradation.

These invariants help identify conditions under which the program may slow down, particularly due to the computational cost of frequent division and insert operations in a loop that can iterate many times for large `n`. By monitoring these conditions, one can preemptively identify potential performance issues with similar input patterns in the future.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
On the well-known testing system MathForces, a draw of n rating units is arranged. The rating will be distributed according to the following algorithm: if k participants take part in this event, then the n rating is evenly distributed between them and rounded to the nearest lower integer, At the end of the drawing, an unused rating may remain — it is not given to any of the participants.

For example, if n = 5 and k = 3, then each participant will recieve an 1 rating unit, and also 2 rating units will remain unused. If n = 5, and k = 6, then none of the participants will increase their rating.

Vasya participates in this rating draw but does not have information on the total number of participants in this event. Therefore, he wants to know what different values of the rating increment are possible to get as a result of this draw and asks you for help.

For example, if n=5, then the answer is equal to the sequence 0, 1, 2, 5. Each of the sequence values (and only them) can be obtained as ⌊ n/k ⌋ for some positive integer k (where ⌊ x ⌋ is the value of x rounded down): 0 = ⌊ 5/7 ⌋, 1 = ⌊ 5/5 ⌋, 2 = ⌊ 5/2 ⌋, 5 = ⌊ 5/1 ⌋.

Write a program that, for a given n, finds a sequence of all possible rating increments.

Input

The first line contains integer number t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10) — the number of test cases in the input. Then t test cases follow.

Each line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) — the total number of the rating units being drawn.

Output

Output the answers for each of t test cases. Each answer should be contained in two lines.

In the first line print a single integer m — the number of different rating increment values that Vasya can get.

In the following line print m integers in ascending order — the values of possible rating increments.

assistant: ### Phase 3: Implementing Natural Language Invariants as C++ Checkers

Let's translate the performance-characterizing invariants from Phase 2 into C++ checker functions. We'll use the template provided to formulate these checks.

1. **Invariant 1: Large `n` and Division Operations**

   ```cpp
   void check_large_n_divisions(long long n, long long curr) {
       if (n >= 1e9 && curr > n / 1000) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to large n causing too many division operations!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Invariant 2: Set Insert Operations**

   ```cpp
   void check_frequent_set_insertions(long long n, long long curr, const set<long long>& used) {
       if (used.size() > 100000 && curr > n / 1000) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to frequent set insertions!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Invariant 3: Loop Execution Count**

   ```cpp
   void check_loop_execution_count(long long n, long long curr) {
       if (curr > n / 1000) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to excessive loop iterations!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Integrating Checkers with the Original Program

Now, we will integrate these checks into the given C++ code to monitor for these performance bottlenecks.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Checker for large n and excessive division operations
void check_large_n_divisions(long long n, long long curr) {
    if (n >= 1e9 && curr > n / 1000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to large n causing too many division operations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Checker for frequent set insertions
void check_frequent_set_insertions(long long n, long long curr, const set<long long>& used) {
    if (used.size() > 100000 && curr > n / 1000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to frequent set insertions!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Checker for excessive loop iterations
void check_loop_execution_count(long long n, long long curr) {
    if (curr > n / 1000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to excessive loop iterations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
    cin.tie(0);
    cout.tie(0);
    
    int t;
    cin >> t;
    while (t--) {
        long long n;
        cin >> n;
        set<long long> ans;
        set<long long> used;
        ans.insert(0);
        ans.insert(1);
        ans.insert(n);

### Explanation

- **Placement of Checks:**
  - The checks are placed strategically before and during the loop execution to catch performance issues without introducing significant overhead.
  - The `check_large_n_divisions`, `check_frequent_set_insertions`, and `check_loop_execution_count` functions are designed to abort execution if a bottleneck condition is detected.
- **Thresholds:**
  - The thresholds in the checks are chosen to reflect the constraints of the problem and typical performance issues when dealing with large data sizes. They serve to highlight problems early on, especially with large inputs.
