### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

Upon comparing the line-level hit counts between the fast and slow inputs, the following observations can be made:

1. **Line 16** (`for (i = 1; i <= sqrt(n) + 1; i++)`):
   - The hit count is significantly higher for the slow input (5035 vs. 75). This suggests that the loop executes many more iterations for larger values of `n`.

2. **Line 17** (`if (s.find(n / i) == s.end())`):
   - There are many more evaluations under the slow input, indicating frequent checks for divisors, which is directly related to the number of iterations in the loop.

3. **Line 18 and Line 19** (`s.insert(i)` and `s.insert(n / i)`):
   - These lines are closely related to line 17 and get hit considerably more in the slow input. The performance of the `set` operations likely degrades due to a large number of unique elements being inserted.

4. **Line 24** (`for (it = s.begin(); it != s.end(); it++) cout << *it << " ";`):
   - This line shows a large difference in hit count (10064 vs. 142), indicating that printing the results is more frequent and the set `s` holds more elements for the slow input.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the analysis, here are the performance-characterizing invariants for the program:

1. **Square Root Loop Iterations**:
   - **Invariant**: "If `n` is large, the loop that iterates up to `sqrt(n)` runs many times. Since the complexity is proportional to `sqrt(n)`, larger values of `n` significantly increase the time complexity."
   - **Condition**: Large `n` leads to a slowdown due to increased loop iterations proportional to `sqrt(n)`.

2. **Frequent Insertions into Set**:
   - **Invariant**: "If `n` is large, the number of divisors and corresponding `set` insertions increases, which results in higher computational overhead for maintaining the set of unique values."
   - **Condition**: For larger `n`, the maintenance of unique elements in a set (due to frequent insertions) becomes costly.

3. **Increased Output Lines**:
   - **Invariant**: "With an increased `n`, the number of possible rating increments grows, resulting in a larger output and more extensive iteration over the set."
   - **Condition**: An increase in the number of elements in `s` leads to prolonged output operations.

These invariants help identify when the program might enter a slow path, focusing on the size of `n` and its effect on loop iterations, set operations, and output formatting. These conditions align with the problem constraints and provide insight into potential future slow scenarios without relying on specific input values.

### Phase 3: Implementing Checkers for Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the natural language invariants derived in Phase 2, here are the C++ code snippets to check the conditions at runtime:

1. **Square Root Loop Iterations Checker**:
   - **Invariant**: "If `n` is large, the loop that iterates up to `sqrt(n)` runs many times."
   - **Checker Implementation**:
   ```cpp
   void check_sqrt_loop_invariant(int n) {
       if (n > 1000000) {  // Arbitrary large threshold for demonstration
           cerr << "Warning: sqrt_loop_invariant triggered - too many iterations due to large n" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Frequent Insertions into Set Checker**:
   - **Invariant**: "If `n` is large, the number of divisors and corresponding `set` insertions increases."
   - **Checker Implementation**:
   ```cpp
   void check_set_insertion_invariant(int n) {
       if (n > 1000000) {  // Arbitrary large threshold for demonstration
           cerr << "Warning: set_insertion_invariant triggered - excessive unique elements in set" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Increased Output Lines Checker**:
   - **Invariant**: "With an increased `n`, the number of possible rating increments grows."
   - **Checker Implementation**:
   ```cpp
   void check_output_size_invariant(int size) {
       if (size > 10000) {  // Arbitrary threshold for demonstration
           cerr << "Warning: output_size_invariant triggered - excessive output size" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Integrating Checkers into the Original C++ Program

Now, we will integrate these checkers into the existing program at appropriate locations to help detect the performance bottlenecks.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Function to check the sqrt loop invariant
void check_sqrt_loop_invariant(int n) {
    if (n > 1000000) {  // Arbitrary large threshold for demonstration
        cerr << "Warning: sqrt_loop_invariant triggered - too many iterations due to large n" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Function to check the set insertion invariant
void check_set_insertion_invariant(int n) {
    if (n > 1000000) {  // Arbitrary large threshold for demonstration
        cerr << "Warning: set_insertion_invariant triggered - excessive unique elements in set" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Function to check the output size invariant
void check_output_size_invariant(int size) {
    if (size > 10000) {  // Arbitrary threshold for demonstration
        cerr << "Warning: output_size_invariant triggered - excessive output size" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    int t;
    cin >> t;
    while (t--) {
        int n, i;
        cin >> n;
        
        // Checking invariants after input
        check_sqrt_loop_invariant(n);
        check_set_insertion_invariant(n);
        
        if (n == 1) {
            cout << 2 << endl;
            cout << 0 << " " << 1 << endl;
            continue;
        }
        set<int> s;
        set<int>::iterator it;
        for (i = 1; i <= sqrt(n) + 1; i++) {
            if (s.find(n / i) == s.end()) {
                s.insert(i);
                if (i != n / i) s.insert(n / i);
            }
        }
        s.insert(0);

        // Checking output size before printing
        check_output_size_invariant(s.size());

        cout << s.size() << endl;
        for (it = s.begin(); it != s.end(); it++) cout << *it << " ";
        cout << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### Comments:
- The checkers are placed right after input reading to detect conditions leading to performance bottlenecks before proceeding with the computation.
- The output size checker is placed before printing the results to ensure control when exceeding expected limits.
- Thresholds are arbitrary and can be adjusted based on specific testing needs or more detailed analysis.
