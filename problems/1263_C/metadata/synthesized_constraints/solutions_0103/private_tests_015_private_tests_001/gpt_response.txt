### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

Upon analyzing the hit counts, the following lines show significant differences between the slow and fast inputs:

- **Line 16:** `for (i = 1; i * i <= n; i++)` has a hit count of 5032 for slow input and 72 for fast input.
- **Line 17:** `if (ma[n / i])` also shows a high number of hits, 5029 for slow input compared to 69 for fast input.
- **Line 20 & 21:** `ans[++cnt] = i; ma[n / i] = 1;` are executed 5029 times for the slow input and 69 times for the fast input.
- **Line 25:** `for (i = 1; i <= cnt; i++) ma[ans[i]] = 1;` shows a hit count of 5035 for slow input versus 75 for fast input.
- **Line 27 to 30:** The loop `for (i = 2; i <= tmp; i++)` and associated operations are also heavily hit in the slow input, with counts of 5032, 5029, 5029, and 5029 respectively, compared to 72, 69, 67, and 67 for fast input.
- **Line 35 & 36:** Printing the result `for (i = 1; i <= cnt; i++) cout << ans[i] << " ";` is significantly higher for slow input with 10064 and 10061 hits, versus 142 and 139 for fast input.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

From the analysis, the following performance-characterizing invariants can be derived:

1. **Square Root Loop Iterations:**
   - **Natural Language Invariant:** "The program may slow down significantly when the value of n is large, causing the loop with `i * i <= n` to iterate many times. This is because the loop iterations grow with the square root of n, leading to numerous operations on each divisor."
   - **Explanation:** The loop iterates over potential divisors, and as n increases, the range of divisors grows, leading to increased check and insert operations.

2. **Map Lookups and Insertions:**
   - **Natural Language Invariant:** "The code could perform inefficiently if numerous lookups and insertions occur in the map for each divisor, particularly when n has many divisors, causing frequent checks and updates."
   - **Explanation:** Each divisor check could potentially involve a map operation, which becomes costly when many divisors are present due to their computational overhead.

3. **Result List Population:**
   - **Natural Language Invariant:** "If n has many divisors, the resultant list of possible ratings can grow large, leading to extensive sorting and printing operations, thereby increasing runtime."
   - **Explanation:** The number of potential ratings increases with each divisor found, causing the list to grow significantly, affecting subsequent sorting and output operations.

4. **Nested Operations with Large n:**
   - **Natural Language Invariant:** "Performance degradation may occur when n is large and nested loops or operations are performed based on the square root of n and its divisors."
   - **Explanation:** Nested operations dependent on divisor calculations can lead to exponential increases in the number of operations, depending on n's size.

These invariants provide insight into conditions that lead to slow execution paths and can guide optimization efforts or input validations.

### Phase 3: Implementing Performance-Characterizing Invariants in C++

Below are the checker functions corresponding to the performance-characterizing invariants derived previously:

```cpp
void check_sqrt_loop_invariant(int n, int iterationCount) {
    // Check if the number of iterations in the loop is much larger than expected
    if (iterationCount > 1000) {  // Threshold based on typical sqrt(n) values
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to high iteration count in sqrt loop!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_map_operations_invariant(int mapSize, int n) {
    // Check if there are too many operations on the map
    if (mapSize > 1000) {  // Threshold for map operations, based on divisor count
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to excessive map operations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_result_list_size_invariant(int listSize) {
    // Check if the result list size is excessively large
    if (listSize > 1000) {  // Arbitrary threshold for large lists
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to large result list size!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrating Checks into the Original Program

Below is the original program with the integrated checks:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int t;
int cnt, ans[100010];
map<int, bool> ma;

int main() {
    int i, j, k;
    scanf("%d", &t);
    while (t--) {
        int n;
        ma.clear();
        cnt = 0;
        scanf("%d", &n);
        ans[++cnt] = 0;

        int iterationCount = 0;

        for (i = 1; i * i <= n; i++) {
            iterationCount++;

            // Check for the square root loop invariant
            check_sqrt_loop_invariant(n, iterationCount);

            if (ma[n / i])
                ans[cnt] = i;
            else {
                ans[++cnt] = i;
                ma[n / i] = true;
            }
        }

        // Check for map operations invariant
        check_map_operations_invariant(ma.size(), n);

        ma.clear();
        for (i = 1; i <= cnt; i++) ma[ans[i]] = true;

        int tmp = cnt;
        for (i = 2; i <= tmp; i++) {
            if (!ma[n / ans[i]]) {
                ans[++cnt] = n / ans[i];
                ma[n / ans[i]] = true;
            }
        }

        sort(ans + 1, ans + cnt + 1);

        // Check for result list size invariant
        check_result_list_size_invariant(cnt);

        cout << cnt << endl;
        for (i = 1; i <= cnt; i++) {
            cout << ans[i] << " ";
        }
        cout << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Square Root Loop Check:** The `check_sqrt_loop_invariant` function is called within the loop that iterates over potential divisors, ensuring it doesn't iterate excessively more than expected.
- **Map Operations Check:** The `check_map_operations_invariant` function is used after the map operations, ensuring the map size doesn't become excessively large.
- **Result List Size Check:** The `check_result_list_size_invariant` function is invoked before outputting the results, ensuring the list size is within reasonable limits.

These integrated checks help detect potential performance bottlenecks during runtime, alerting the user and aborting execution if any invariant is triggered.
