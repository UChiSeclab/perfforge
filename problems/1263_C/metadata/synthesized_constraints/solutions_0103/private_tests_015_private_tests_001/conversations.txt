system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

On the well-known testing system MathForces, a draw of n rating units is arranged. The rating will be distributed according to the following algorithm: if k participants take part in this event, then the n rating is evenly distributed between them and rounded to the nearest lower integer, At the end of the drawing, an unused rating may remain — it is not given to any of the participants.

For example, if n = 5 and k = 3, then each participant will recieve an 1 rating unit, and also 2 rating units will remain unused. If n = 5, and k = 6, then none of the participants will increase their rating.

Vasya participates in this rating draw but does not have information on the total number of participants in this event. Therefore, he wants to know what different values of the rating increment are possible to get as a result of this draw and asks you for help.

For example, if n=5, then the answer is equal to the sequence 0, 1, 2, 5. Each of the sequence values (and only them) can be obtained as ⌊ n/k ⌋ for some positive integer k (where ⌊ x ⌋ is the value of x rounded down): 0 = ⌊ 5/7 ⌋, 1 = ⌊ 5/5 ⌋, 2 = ⌊ 5/2 ⌋, 5 = ⌊ 5/1 ⌋.

Write a program that, for a given n, finds a sequence of all possible rating increments.

Input

The first line contains integer number t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10) — the number of test cases in the input. Then t test cases follow.

Each line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) — the total number of the rating units being drawn.

Output

Output the answers for each of t test cases. Each answer should be contained in two lines.

In the first line print a single integer m — the number of different rating increment values that Vasya can get.

In the following line print m integers in ascending order — the values of possible rating increments.

assistant: ### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

Upon analyzing the hit counts, the following lines show significant differences between the slow and fast inputs:

- **Line 16:** `for (i = 1; i * i <= n; i++)` has a hit count of 5032 for slow input and 72 for fast input.
- **Line 17:** `if (ma[n / i])` also shows a high number of hits, 5029 for slow input compared to 69 for fast input.
- **Line 20 & 21:** `ans[++cnt] = i; ma[n / i] = 1;` are executed 5029 times for the slow input and 69 times for the fast input.
- **Line 25:** `for (i = 1; i <= cnt; i++) ma[ans[i]] = 1;` shows a hit count of 5035 for slow input versus 75 for fast input.
- **Line 27 to 30:** The loop `for (i = 2; i <= tmp; i++)` and associated operations are also heavily hit in the slow input, with counts of 5032, 5029, 5029, and 5029 respectively, compared to 72, 69, 67, and 67 for fast input.
- **Line 35 & 36:** Printing the result `for (i = 1; i <= cnt; i++) cout << ans[i] << " ";` is significantly higher for slow input with 10064 and 10061 hits, versus 142 and 139 for fast input.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

From the analysis, the following performance-characterizing invariants can be derived:

1. **Square Root Loop Iterations:**
   - **Natural Language Invariant:** "The program may slow down significantly when the value of n is large, causing the loop with `i * i <= n` to iterate many times. This is because the loop iterations grow with the square root of n, leading to numerous operations on each divisor."
   - **Explanation:** The loop iterates over potential divisors, and as n increases, the range of divisors grows, leading to increased check and insert operations.

2. **Map Lookups and Insertions:**
   - **Natural Language Invariant:** "The code could perform inefficiently if numerous lookups and insertions occur in the map for each divisor, particularly when n has many divisors, causing frequent checks and updates."
   - **Explanation:** Each divisor check could potentially involve a map operation, which becomes costly when many divisors are present due to their computational overhead.

3. **Result List Population:**
   - **Natural Language Invariant:** "If n has many divisors, the resultant list of possible ratings can grow large, leading to extensive sorting and printing operations, thereby increasing runtime."
   - **Explanation:** The number of potential ratings increases with each divisor found, causing the list to grow significantly, affecting subsequent sorting and output operations.

4. **Nested Operations with Large n:**
   - **Natural Language Invariant:** "Performance degradation may occur when n is large and nested loops or operations are performed based on the square root of n and its divisors."
   - **Explanation:** Nested operations dependent on divisor calculations can lead to exponential increases in the number of operations, depending on n's size.

These invariants provide insight into conditions that lead to slow execution paths and can guide optimization efforts or input validations.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
On the well-known testing system MathForces, a draw of n rating units is arranged. The rating will be distributed according to the following algorithm: if k participants take part in this event, then the n rating is evenly distributed between them and rounded to the nearest lower integer, At the end of the drawing, an unused rating may remain — it is not given to any of the participants.

For example, if n = 5 and k = 3, then each participant will recieve an 1 rating unit, and also 2 rating units will remain unused. If n = 5, and k = 6, then none of the participants will increase their rating.

Vasya participates in this rating draw but does not have information on the total number of participants in this event. Therefore, he wants to know what different values of the rating increment are possible to get as a result of this draw and asks you for help.

For example, if n=5, then the answer is equal to the sequence 0, 1, 2, 5. Each of the sequence values (and only them) can be obtained as ⌊ n/k ⌋ for some positive integer k (where ⌊ x ⌋ is the value of x rounded down): 0 = ⌊ 5/7 ⌋, 1 = ⌊ 5/5 ⌋, 2 = ⌊ 5/2 ⌋, 5 = ⌊ 5/1 ⌋.

Write a program that, for a given n, finds a sequence of all possible rating increments.

Input

The first line contains integer number t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10) — the number of test cases in the input. Then t test cases follow.

Each line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) — the total number of the rating units being drawn.

Output

Output the answers for each of t test cases. Each answer should be contained in two lines.

In the first line print a single integer m — the number of different rating increment values that Vasya can get.

In the following line print m integers in ascending order — the values of possible rating increments.

assistant: ### Phase 3: Implementing Performance-Characterizing Invariants in C++

Below are the checker functions corresponding to the performance-characterizing invariants derived previously:

```cpp
void check_sqrt_loop_invariant(int n, int iterationCount) {
    // Check if the number of iterations in the loop is much larger than expected
    if (iterationCount > 1000) {  // Threshold based on typical sqrt(n) values
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to high iteration count in sqrt loop!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_map_operations_invariant(int mapSize, int n) {
    // Check if there are too many operations on the map
    if (mapSize > 1000) {  // Threshold for map operations, based on divisor count
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to excessive map operations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_result_list_size_invariant(int listSize) {
    // Check if the result list size is excessively large
    if (listSize > 1000) {  // Arbitrary threshold for large lists
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to large result list size!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrating Checks into the Original Program

Below is the original program with the integrated checks:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int t;
int cnt, ans[100010];
map<int, bool> ma;

int main() {
    int i, j, k;
    scanf("%d", &t);
    while (t--) {
        int n;

### Explanation:
- **Square Root Loop Check:** The `check_sqrt_loop_invariant` function is called within the loop that iterates over potential divisors, ensuring it doesn't iterate excessively more than expected.
- **Map Operations Check:** The `check_map_operations_invariant` function is used after the map operations, ensuring the map size doesn't become excessively large.
- **Result List Size Check:** The `check_result_list_size_invariant` function is invoked before outputting the results, ensuring the list size is within reasonable limits.

These integrated checks help detect potential performance bottlenecks during runtime, alerting the user and aborting execution if any invariant is triggered.
