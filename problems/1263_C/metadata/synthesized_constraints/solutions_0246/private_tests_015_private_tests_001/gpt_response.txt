### Performance Analysis

#### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Line-level Hit Count Analysis**:
   - Line 15: `for (int i = 1; i * i <= n; ++i)` has significantly more hits for the slow input (5032 vs. 72). This loop iterates through all possible divisors up to the square root of `n`.
   - Lines 16-17: Calculations for `a = n / i` and `b = n / a` are also hit frequently, suggesting these operations are performed for every iteration of the loop.
   - Lines 18-24: The use of a map `ma` to check and store unique values indicates that the condition checks (`if (!ma[a])`, `if (!ma[b])`) and subsequent assignments are being executed many times, matching the loop's iterations.

2. **Data Structure Interaction**:
   - The map `ma` is used to store unique values of divisors, which is crucial for ensuring each potential rating increment is only counted once.
   - The array `ans` stores the results of unique rating increments, which are later sorted.

3. **Loop and Input Constraints**:
   - The loop iterates up to √n times. Given that n can be as large as 1 billion, the maximum loop count can be around 31,622, which is substantial and can lead to performance issues if n is large.

#### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the analysis and constraints, the following natural language invariants capture conditions leading to slow execution:

1. **Invariant: Large n Values**
   - **Natural Language Description**: "When `n` is large, the loop iterating through up to the square root of `n` results in a high hit count, leading to performance degradation."
   - **Explanation**: As `n` increases, the loop's maximum iteration count (up to √n) grows substantially, leading to increased computation time, especially for values close to the constraint (n <= 10^9).

2. **Invariant: Dense Divisor Distribution**
   - **Natural Language Description**: "If `n` has a dense distribution of divisors, the map used to track unique increments can become a performance bottleneck due to frequent insertions and lookups."
   - **Explanation**: A large number of divisors results in more unique entries being checked and stored, causing increased computational overhead.

3. **Invariant: Loop and Map Interaction**
   - **Natural Language Description**: "When the loop iterates a large number of times due to a high value of `n` and the map frequently processes new entries, the combined effect slows down execution significantly."
   - **Explanation**: The interaction between the loop's high iteration count and the map's capacity to store unique increments can lead to slower execution, particularly for large `n`.

### Conclusion

The primary performance bottleneck arises from the loop iterating over a large number of potential divisors and the frequent use of a map to ensure unique values. These operations cause the program to slow down significantly as `n` approaches its upper constraint, particularly when `n` has many divisors. The invariants provide a framework for understanding and diagnosing potential slow paths in similar contexts.

### Phase 3: Implementing Checker Code for Invariants

Based on the performance-characterizing invariants derived earlier, here is how you can write C++ code to implement these checks:

1. **Invariant Check for Large `n` Values**:
   - **Description**: Check if the input `n` is significantly large, which may lead to a high number of iterations in the loop.
   
   ```cpp
   void check_large_n_invariant(long long n) {
       if (n >= 1e9) { // Threshold chosen based on problem constraints
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large n value!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Invariant Check for Dense Divisor Distribution**:
   - **Description**: Check if the number of unique divisors approaches the upper limit of anticipated unique entries in the map, which may lead to performance issues.
   
   ```cpp
   void check_dense_divisor_invariant(long long tot) {
       if (tot > 1000) { // Arbitrary threshold for too many unique divisors
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - too many unique divisors!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Invariant Check for Loop and Map Interaction**:
   - **Description**: Check if the loop runs a large number of iterations which could imply the map is being stressed with frequent checks.
   
   ```cpp
   void check_loop_map_interaction(int loopIterations, long long max_map_size) {
       if (loopIterations > 30000 || max_map_size > 1000) { // Threshold for iterations and map size
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive loop or map usage!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Integrate Checks into the Original C++ Code

Now we integrate the above checks into the original program. Place checks at effective points to detect potential slow paths.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

const long long mod = 1e9 + 7;
long long ans[100010];
long long t, n, tot;
map<long long, bool> ma;

// Invariant check functions
void check_large_n_invariant(long long n) {
    if (n >= 1e9) { // Threshold chosen based on problem constraints
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large n value!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_dense_divisor_invariant(long long tot) {
    if (tot > 1000) { // Arbitrary threshold for too many unique divisors
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - too many unique divisors!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_loop_map_interaction(int loopIterations, long long max_map_size) {
    if (loopIterations > 30000 || max_map_size > 1000) { // Threshold for iterations and map size
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive loop or map usage!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin >> t;
    while (t--) {
        ma.clear();
        tot = 0;
        cin >> n;

        // Check for large n
        check_large_n_invariant(n);

        ans[++tot] = 0;
        int loopIterations = 0;
        long long max_map_size = 0;
        
        for (int i = 1; i * i <= n; ++i) {
            long long a = n / i;
            long long b = n / a;
            loopIterations++;
            if (!ma[a]) {
                ma[a] = 1;
                ans[++tot] = a;
            }
            if (!ma[b]) {
                ma[b] = 1;
                ans[++tot] = b;
            }
            max_map_size = ma.size();
        }
        
        // Check for loop and map interaction
        check_loop_map_interaction(loopIterations, max_map_size);

        sort(ans + 1, ans + 1 + tot);

        // Check for too many unique divisors
        check_dense_divisor_invariant(tot);

        cout << tot << "\n";
        for (int i = 1; i <= tot; ++i) cout << ans[i] << " ";
        cout << "\n";
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

- **Check Placement**: Each checker is strategically placed to evaluate the critical conditions:
  - The large `n` invariant is checked immediately after reading `n`.
  - The loop-map interaction check is placed after the loop to count iterations and map size.
  - The dense divisor check is placed after collecting all unique divisors.

This code should help identify slow paths by triggering warnings under conditions that could lead to performance bottlenecks.
