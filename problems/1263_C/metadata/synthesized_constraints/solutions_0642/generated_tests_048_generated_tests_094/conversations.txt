system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

On the well-known testing system MathForces, a draw of n rating units is arranged. The rating will be distributed according to the following algorithm: if k participants take part in this event, then the n rating is evenly distributed between them and rounded to the nearest lower integer, At the end of the drawing, an unused rating may remain — it is not given to any of the participants.

For example, if n = 5 and k = 3, then each participant will recieve an 1 rating unit, and also 2 rating units will remain unused. If n = 5, and k = 6, then none of the participants will increase their rating.

Vasya participates in this rating draw but does not have information on the total number of participants in this event. Therefore, he wants to know what different values of the rating increment are possible to get as a result of this draw and asks you for help.

For example, if n=5, then the answer is equal to the sequence 0, 1, 2, 5. Each of the sequence values (and only them) can be obtained as ⌊ n/k ⌋ for some positive integer k (where ⌊ x ⌋ is the value of x rounded down): 0 = ⌊ 5/7 ⌋, 1 = ⌊ 5/5 ⌋, 2 = ⌊ 5/2 ⌋, 5 = ⌊ 5/1 ⌋.

Write a program that, for a given n, finds a sequence of all possible rating increments.

Input

The first line contains integer number t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10) — the number of test cases in the input. Then t test cases follow.

Each line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) — the total number of the rating units being drawn.

Output

Output the answers for each of t test cases. Each answer should be contained in two lines.

In the first line print a single integer m — the number of different rating increment values that Vasya can get.

In the following line print m integers in ascending order — the values of possible rating increments.

assistant: To analyze the C program's performance based on the provided information, we need to identify potential performance bottlenecks and derive performance-characterizing invariants. The goal is to determine why the slow input behaves differently than the fast input and what conditions might trigger such slowdowns.

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Line-Level Hit Count Comparison:**
   - The line `for (long long i = 1; i < n1 + 1; i++)` (line 18) has significantly more hits for the slow input (85,664) compared to the fast input (64,332).
   - The line `s.insert(n / i);` (line 19) is also hit more often under the slow input (85,660) than the fast input (64,328).

2. **Inference on Interaction with Data Structures:**
   - The loop iterates from `1` to `n1`, where `n1` is equal to `n` unless `n` exceeds 1,000,000.
   - For large values of `n`, this loop performs a substantial number of divisions and insertions into the set `s`.
   - The complexity is heavily dependent on how many distinct values are generated by `n / i` for the range `1` to `n`.

3. **Input Constraints Interaction:**
   - Since `n` can be up to \(10^9\), if the divisor `i` is not significantly reducing the number of iterations by yielding many unique values early, the loop can become costly.
   - The set `s` will accumulate these values, leading to potentially repetitive and expensive operations due to the nature of the insert operation.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **Invariant on Loop Iteration and Unique Values:**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "If the number of unique values generated by `n / i` is significantly low compared to `n`, particularly when `n` is large, the program may slow down due to redundant calculations and insertions."
   - **Threshold:** Although `n1` is often `n`, if the density of unique divisions (`n / i`) is low, this condition can trigger. This is exacerbated as `n` approaches its upper limit.

2. **Invariant on Set Operations:**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "If the set accumulates a large number of elements rapidly without enough unique incremental steps, the overhead of maintaining uniqueness in the set can degrade performance."
   - **Threshold:** This is more likely when `n` is large, and the divisors `i` do not contribute to many new unique entries, causing repeated calculations and insertions.

3. **Invariant on Large Divisions:**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "If the loop iterating over `n1` performs divisions that frequently result in repeated values, there will be performance degradation due to inefficient use of computation without yielding uniquely useful results."
   - **Threshold:** As `n` approaches \(10^9\), and if divisors are not sufficiently varied, this repetitive behavior is more pronounced.

### Summary

The slow input appears to trigger a scenario where the loop and division operations generate many redundant values, leading to inefficient set operations. By identifying conditions under which `n / i` yields comparable results across many iterations, and when the set grows without sufficient new information, we can understand the performance bottleneck. These natural language invariants help capture these subtle yet impactful conditions and can guide optimizations or checks to avoid slow performance paths in future executions.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
On the well-known testing system MathForces, a draw of n rating units is arranged. The rating will be distributed according to the following algorithm: if k participants take part in this event, then the n rating is evenly distributed between them and rounded to the nearest lower integer, At the end of the drawing, an unused rating may remain — it is not given to any of the participants.

For example, if n = 5 and k = 3, then each participant will recieve an 1 rating unit, and also 2 rating units will remain unused. If n = 5, and k = 6, then none of the participants will increase their rating.

Vasya participates in this rating draw but does not have information on the total number of participants in this event. Therefore, he wants to know what different values of the rating increment are possible to get as a result of this draw and asks you for help.

For example, if n=5, then the answer is equal to the sequence 0, 1, 2, 5. Each of the sequence values (and only them) can be obtained as ⌊ n/k ⌋ for some positive integer k (where ⌊ x ⌋ is the value of x rounded down): 0 = ⌊ 5/7 ⌋, 1 = ⌊ 5/5 ⌋, 2 = ⌊ 5/2 ⌋, 5 = ⌊ 5/1 ⌋.

Write a program that, for a given n, finds a sequence of all possible rating increments.

Input

The first line contains integer number t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10) — the number of test cases in the input. Then t test cases follow.

Each line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) — the total number of the rating units being drawn.

Output

Output the answers for each of t test cases. Each answer should be contained in two lines.

In the first line print a single integer m — the number of different rating increment values that Vasya can get.

In the following line print m integers in ascending order — the values of possible rating increments.

assistant: Let's start with Phase 3, where I'll implement the natural language invariants derived in Phase 2 as C++ runtime checks.

### Phase 3: Implementing Performance-Characterizing Invariants in C++

We'll provide C++ code snippets to check the conditions described by the invariants:

1. **Invariant on Loop Iteration and Unique Values:**

   ```cpp
   void check_unique_density_invariant(long long n, const std::set<long long>& s) {
       long long uniqueCount = s.size();
       long long threshold = std::sqrt(n); // Example threshold based on a heuristic
       if (uniqueCount < threshold) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered by low unique value density!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Invariant on Set Operations:**

   ```cpp
   void check_set_growth_invariant(long long n, const std::set<long long>& s) {
       long long setSize = s.size();
       if (setSize > std::log2(n) * 10) { // Example threshold using logarithmic growth
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered by rapid set growth!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Invariant on Large Divisions:**

   ```cpp
   void check_redundant_calculation_invariant(long long n, long long divisorRange) {
       if (divisorRange > std::log2(n) * 100) { // Example threshold using divisor range
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered by redundant calculations!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Integrate Checkers into the Original Program

Now we will integrate these checkers into the C++ program at effective points in the control flow to avoid adding overhead in tight loops.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Checkers based on derived invariants
void check_unique_density_invariant(long long n, const std::set<long long>& s) {
    long long uniqueCount = s.size();
    long long threshold = std::sqrt(n); // Example threshold based on a heuristic
    if (uniqueCount < threshold) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered by low unique value density!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_set_growth_invariant(long long n, const std::set<long long>& s) {
    long long setSize = s.size();
    if (setSize > std::log2(n) * 10) { // Example threshold using logarithmic growth
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered by rapid set growth!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_redundant_calculation_invariant(long long n, long long divisorRange) {
    if (divisorRange > std::log2(n) * 100) { // Example threshold using divisor range
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered by redundant calculations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

signed main() {
    ios::sync_with_stdio(0);
    cin.tie(0);
    long long t;
    cin >> t;
    while (t--) {
        long long n, n1, a;
        cin >> n;
        set<long long> s;
        n1 = n;
        if (n > 1000000) {
            n1 = 1000000;
            a = n / pow(10, 6);
            for (long long i = 1; i < a + 1; i++) s.insert(i);
        }

### Explanation of Integration

- **Check Placement:** The checks are placed after the set `s` is populated to analyze its characteristics without interfering with the loop's tight performance.
- **Thresholds:** The thresholds used in the checks are based on heuristics (e.g., logarithmic and square root functions) to capture potential slowdowns without relying on specific numeric values from the slow inputs.
- **Abort on Trigger:** Each check will output a warning and abort the program if a performance bottleneck condition is detected, aiding in identifying slow paths during testing.
