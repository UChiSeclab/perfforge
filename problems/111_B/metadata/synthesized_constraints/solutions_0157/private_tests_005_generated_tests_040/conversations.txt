system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

Little Petya loves looking for numbers' divisors. One day Petya came across the following problem:

You are given n queries in the form "xi yi". For each query Petya should count how many divisors of number xi divide none of the numbers xi - yi, xi - yi + 1, ..., xi - 1. Help him.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105). Each of the following n lines contain two space-separated integers xi and yi (1 ≤ xi ≤ 105, 0 ≤ yi ≤ i - 1, where i is the query's ordinal number; the numeration starts with 1). 

If yi = 0 for the query, then the answer to the query will be the number of divisors of the number xi. In this case you do not need to take the previous numbers x into consideration.

Output

For each query print the answer on a single line: the number of positive integers k such that <image>

Examples

Input

6
4 0
3 1
5 2
6 2
18 4
10000 3


Output

1) 1, 2, 4 

2) 3

3) 5

4) 2, 6

5) 9, 18

assistant: ### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Line-Level Hit Count Analysis:**
   - **Line 24:** The loop `for (int j = b; j <= mx; j += b)` has a significantly higher hit count for the slow input (323,076 vs. 227,515 for the fast input). This suggests that this loop executes many more times in the slow scenario.
   - **Line 25:** The check `if (last[j] >= k - y[k])` is responsible for the triggering of the loop's main logic. The high hit count indicates this condition is being checked excessively.
   - **Line 12, 13, 14:** These lines are responsible for finding divisors. The hit counts are slightly higher for the slow input, indicating more divisors are being processed.
   - **Line 18:** The loop `for (int i = 1; i <= pn; i++)` iterates over the divisors of `a`. The hit count difference (198 vs. 172) suggests that the process of marking divisors is more intensive for the slow input.

2. **Interaction with Data Structures:**
   - The array `last` is being accessed frequently inside nested loops, resulting in repeated checks and potential updates.
   - The variable `mx` is updated with the maximum value of `x[k]`, impacting the range and number of iterations of the innermost loop.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **Invariant #1: High Number of Divisors**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "If a number has a high number of divisors, the program spends more time processing these divisors, leading to slow performance. This is particularly significant when `x[i]` is large, causing extensive divisor calculations."
   - **Threshold Suggestion:** Consider the divisor count of numbers close to 100,000, as they may have a more significant impact on performance.

2. **Invariant #2: Large Range for Validation Check**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "When the maximum value `mx` is significantly larger, the nested loop that checks each divisor against previous states (`last[j]` array) executes more times, slowing the process."
   - **Threshold Suggestion:** The program may slow down when `mx` is close to its upper bound (100,000), causing the inner loop to iterate over a large range.

3. **Invariant #3: Frequent Re-Validation of Divisors**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "Repeatedly validating large numbers of divisors against prior queries (`last` array checks) can slow down the program, especially when `y[i]` values are non-zero, requiring additional conditions to be checked."
   - **Threshold Suggestion:** Increased complexity when `y[i]` approaches `i`, necessitating additional re-validation of divisors.

4. **Invariant #4: High Iteration Loop Over Divisors**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "The program might slow down when the divisor range (`pn`) is large, causing multiple iterations over divisors for each query."
   - **Threshold Suggestion:** Consider when divisor counts (`pn`) exceed typical values expected for smaller `x[i]`, especially close to maximum input constraints.

These invariants aim to characterize potential performance bottlenecks without relying on specific input values, focusing instead on input patterns and structural conditions leading to slow execution paths.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
Little Petya loves looking for numbers' divisors. One day Petya came across the following problem:

You are given n queries in the form "xi yi". For each query Petya should count how many divisors of number xi divide none of the numbers xi - yi, xi - yi + 1, ..., xi - 1. Help him.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105). Each of the following n lines contain two space-separated integers xi and yi (1 ≤ xi ≤ 105, 0 ≤ yi ≤ i - 1, where i is the query's ordinal number; the numeration starts with 1). 

If yi = 0 for the query, then the answer to the query will be the number of divisors of the number xi. In this case you do not need to take the previous numbers x into consideration.

Output

For each query print the answer on a single line: the number of positive integers k such that <image>

Examples

Input

3 1
5 2
6 2
18 4
10000 3


Output

Note

Let's write out the divisors that give answers for the first 5 queries:

1) 1, 2, 4 

2) 3

3) 5

4) 2, 6

5) 9, 18

Solution (C++ code):
{solution}


assistant: ### Phase 3: Implementing Natural Language Invariants in C++ Checkers

Based on the invariants derived earlier, here are the C++ checkers for each:

1. **High Number of Divisors:**
   ```cpp
   void check_divisor_count_invariant(int divisorCount) {
       if (divisorCount > 500) {  // Assuming 500 as a reasonable threshold for high divisor count.
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high number of divisors!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Large Range for Validation Check:**
   ```cpp
   void check_large_range_invariant(int mx) {
       if (mx > 95000) {  // Assuming 95000 as a threshold close to maximum input range.
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large range for validation!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Frequent Re-Validation of Divisors:**
   ```cpp
   void check_frequent_revalidation_invariant(int y, int k) {
       if (y == k - 1) {  // Frequent re-validation when y is close to k-1.
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - frequent re-validation of divisors!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

4. **High Iteration Loop Over Divisors:**
   ```cpp
   void check_high_iteration_invariant(int pn) {
       if (pn > 100) {  // Assuming 100 as a threshold for high iteration over divisors.
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high iteration over divisors!" << endl;
           abort();
       }

### Phase 4: Integrating Checkers into the Original Program

Below is the instrumented C++ program with integrated checks:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
const int N = 1e5 + 2, M = 1e5;
int n, x[N], y[N], fac[N], vis[N], last[N];

// Checkers based on derived invariants
void check_divisor_count_invariant(int divisorCount) {
    if (divisorCount > 500) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high number of divisors!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_large_range_invariant(int mx) {
    if (mx > 95000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large range for validation!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_frequent_revalidation_invariant(int y, int k) {
    if (y == k - 1) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - frequent re-validation of divisors!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_high_iteration_invariant(int pn) {
    if (pn > 100) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high iteration over divisors!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    int n, mx = 0;
    scanf("%d", &n);
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) scanf("%d%d", &x[i], &y[i]);
    check_large_range_invariant(mx);  // Check for large range validation before processing

    for (int k = 1; k <= n; k++) {
        int a = x[k], pn = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i * i <= a; i++) {
            if (a % i == 0) {
                fac[++pn] = i;
                if (i * i != a) fac[++pn] = a / i;
            }
        }
        // Check high divisor count
        check_divisor_count_invariant(pn);

        for (int i = 1; i <= pn; i++) vis[i] = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= pn; i++) {
            if (i == 1) {
                if (y[k]) vis[i] = 1;
                continue;
            }
            int b = fac[i];
            for (int j = b; j <= mx; j += b) {
                if (last[j] >= k - y[k]) {
                    vis[i] = 1;
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
        int ans = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= pn; i++) {
            if (!vis[i]) ans++;
            last[fac[i]] = k;
        }
        printf("%d\n", ans);
        last[a] = k, mx = max(mx, a);

        // Check frequently re-validating divisors
        check_frequent_revalidation_invariant(y[k], k);

        // Check high iteration over divisors
        check_high_iteration_invariant(pn);
    }
    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**
- **Checker Functions:** Each function corresponds to one of the identified bottlenecks. They are inserted at logical points to monitor and abort the program when a potential slowdown condition is triggered.
- **Placement:** The checks are placed outside the innermost loops to minimize performance overhead and only execute before or after potentially expensive operations.
