### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Line-Level Hit Count Analysis:**
   - **Line 24:** The loop `for (int j = b; j <= mx; j += b)` has a significantly higher hit count for the slow input (323,076 vs. 227,515 for the fast input). This suggests that this loop executes many more times in the slow scenario.
   - **Line 25:** The check `if (last[j] >= k - y[k])` is responsible for the triggering of the loop's main logic. The high hit count indicates this condition is being checked excessively.
   - **Line 12, 13, 14:** These lines are responsible for finding divisors. The hit counts are slightly higher for the slow input, indicating more divisors are being processed.
   - **Line 18:** The loop `for (int i = 1; i <= pn; i++)` iterates over the divisors of `a`. The hit count difference (198 vs. 172) suggests that the process of marking divisors is more intensive for the slow input.

2. **Interaction with Data Structures:**
   - The array `last` is being accessed frequently inside nested loops, resulting in repeated checks and potential updates.
   - The variable `mx` is updated with the maximum value of `x[k]`, impacting the range and number of iterations of the innermost loop.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **Invariant #1: High Number of Divisors**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "If a number has a high number of divisors, the program spends more time processing these divisors, leading to slow performance. This is particularly significant when `x[i]` is large, causing extensive divisor calculations."
   - **Threshold Suggestion:** Consider the divisor count of numbers close to 100,000, as they may have a more significant impact on performance.

2. **Invariant #2: Large Range for Validation Check**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "When the maximum value `mx` is significantly larger, the nested loop that checks each divisor against previous states (`last[j]` array) executes more times, slowing the process."
   - **Threshold Suggestion:** The program may slow down when `mx` is close to its upper bound (100,000), causing the inner loop to iterate over a large range.

3. **Invariant #3: Frequent Re-Validation of Divisors**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "Repeatedly validating large numbers of divisors against prior queries (`last` array checks) can slow down the program, especially when `y[i]` values are non-zero, requiring additional conditions to be checked."
   - **Threshold Suggestion:** Increased complexity when `y[i]` approaches `i`, necessitating additional re-validation of divisors.

4. **Invariant #4: High Iteration Loop Over Divisors**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "The program might slow down when the divisor range (`pn`) is large, causing multiple iterations over divisors for each query."
   - **Threshold Suggestion:** Consider when divisor counts (`pn`) exceed typical values expected for smaller `x[i]`, especially close to maximum input constraints.

These invariants aim to characterize potential performance bottlenecks without relying on specific input values, focusing instead on input patterns and structural conditions leading to slow execution paths.

### Phase 3: Implementing Natural Language Invariants in C++ Checkers

Based on the invariants derived earlier, here are the C++ checkers for each:

1. **High Number of Divisors:**
   ```cpp
   void check_divisor_count_invariant(int divisorCount) {
       if (divisorCount > 500) {  // Assuming 500 as a reasonable threshold for high divisor count.
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high number of divisors!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Large Range for Validation Check:**
   ```cpp
   void check_large_range_invariant(int mx) {
       if (mx > 95000) {  // Assuming 95000 as a threshold close to maximum input range.
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large range for validation!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Frequent Re-Validation of Divisors:**
   ```cpp
   void check_frequent_revalidation_invariant(int y, int k) {
       if (y == k - 1) {  // Frequent re-validation when y is close to k-1.
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - frequent re-validation of divisors!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

4. **High Iteration Loop Over Divisors:**
   ```cpp
   void check_high_iteration_invariant(int pn) {
       if (pn > 100) {  // Assuming 100 as a threshold for high iteration over divisors.
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high iteration over divisors!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Integrating Checkers into the Original Program

Below is the instrumented C++ program with integrated checks:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
const int N = 1e5 + 2, M = 1e5;
int n, x[N], y[N], fac[N], vis[N], last[N];

// Checkers based on derived invariants
void check_divisor_count_invariant(int divisorCount) {
    if (divisorCount > 500) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high number of divisors!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_large_range_invariant(int mx) {
    if (mx > 95000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large range for validation!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_frequent_revalidation_invariant(int y, int k) {
    if (y == k - 1) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - frequent re-validation of divisors!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_high_iteration_invariant(int pn) {
    if (pn > 100) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high iteration over divisors!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    int n, mx = 0;
    scanf("%d", &n);
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) scanf("%d%d", &x[i], &y[i]);
    check_large_range_invariant(mx);  // Check for large range validation before processing

    for (int k = 1; k <= n; k++) {
        int a = x[k], pn = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i * i <= a; i++) {
            if (a % i == 0) {
                fac[++pn] = i;
                if (i * i != a) fac[++pn] = a / i;
            }
        }
        // Check high divisor count
        check_divisor_count_invariant(pn);

        for (int i = 1; i <= pn; i++) vis[i] = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= pn; i++) {
            if (i == 1) {
                if (y[k]) vis[i] = 1;
                continue;
            }
            int b = fac[i];
            for (int j = b; j <= mx; j += b) {
                if (last[j] >= k - y[k]) {
                    vis[i] = 1;
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
        int ans = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= pn; i++) {
            if (!vis[i]) ans++;
            last[fac[i]] = k;
        }
        printf("%d\n", ans);
        last[a] = k, mx = max(mx, a);

        // Check frequently re-validating divisors
        check_frequent_revalidation_invariant(y[k], k);

        // Check high iteration over divisors
        check_high_iteration_invariant(pn);
    }
    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**
- **Checker Functions:** Each function corresponds to one of the identified bottlenecks. They are inserted at logical points to monitor and abort the program when a potential slowdown condition is triggered.
- **Placement:** The checks are placed outside the innermost loops to minimize performance overhead and only execute before or after potentially expensive operations.
