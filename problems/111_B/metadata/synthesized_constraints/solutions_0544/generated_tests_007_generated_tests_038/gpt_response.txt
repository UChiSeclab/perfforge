## Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

To identify code segments responsible for the slowdown, let's compare the line-level hit counts between the slow and fast runs:

1. **Nested Loop for Compiling Divisors (Lines 11-15)**:
   - Slow input: `3816` hits
   - Fast input: `1908` hits
   - The loop runs up to 318 iterations for each query to find divisors of `x[i]`. This indicates that the divisors are computed for more numbers or more extensively in the slow case.

2. **Checking Divisors Against Previous Queries (Lines 21-43)**:
   - Slow input: `3533` hits (Line 21)
   - Fast input: `119` hits (Line 21)
   - This loop is significantly more active in the slow run, suggesting either more divisors to check or more complex conditions involving previous queries.

3. **Use of `set::lower_bound` and Set Iterations (Lines 25-31, 37-43)**:
   - Hits involving `set::lower_bound` are much higher in the slow input, e.g., Line 25 (`88` vs. `22`) and Line 37 (`88` vs. `20`).
   - These operations imply the slow run is processing more entries or doing more comparisons to determine unique divisors.

## Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

From the observations, we can derive performance-characterizing invariants that describe conditions under which the program slows down:

1. **High Number of Divisors**:
   - Natural Language Invariant: "If `x[i]` has many divisors, especially if `x[i]` is a large composite number, the program may slow down due to exhaustive divisor checks."
   - Explanation: Large composite numbers have more divisors leading to more set operations.

2. **Repeated Divisor Checks Against Large Ranges**:
   - Natural Language Invariant: "When `y[i]` is large relative to `i`, the range of numbers (`x[i] - y[i]` to `x[i] - 1`) is extensive, leading to more frequent and redundant divisor checks in previous queries."
   - Explanation: Larger `y[i]` values increase the range size, adding complexity to checks against previous entries.

3. **Frequent Set Operations**:
   - Natural Language Invariant: "If the number of distinct divisor checks is high (due to large `x[i]` values or repeated queries with similar divisor characteristics), the set operations become a bottleneck."
   - Explanation: Set operations grow with the number of entries and complexity of the queries.

These invariants capture the essence of the slow paths in the code, relating specifically to the characteristics of input numbers and how they interact with the algorithm's structure. By focusing on these conditions, you can anticipate and potentially optimize the problematic sections to handle large inputs more efficiently.

## Phase 3: Implement the Natural Language Invariants in C++

Here are the checks implemented from the natural language invariants derived previously:

1. **High Number of Divisors**:
   ```cpp
   void check_divisor_invariant(int divisorCount, int threshold = 100) {
       if (divisorCount > threshold) {
           cerr << "Warning: High number of divisors leading to potential slowdown!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Repeated Divisor Checks Against Large Ranges**:
   ```cpp
   void check_range_invariant(int yi, int i, int threshold = 50) {
       if (yi > threshold) {
           cerr << "Warning: Large range for divisor checks detected!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Frequent Set Operations**:
   ```cpp
   void check_set_invariant(int setOperations, int threshold = 1000) {
       if (setOperations > threshold) {
           cerr << "Warning: Excessive set operations detected - potential bottleneck!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

## Phase 4: Integrate Checkers into the Original C++ Code

Here is the instrumented version of the given C++ code with the performance checkers integrated:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int n;
int x[100001], y[100001];
set<pair<int, int>> comp;

// Checker functions
void check_divisor_invariant(int divisorCount, int threshold = 100) {
    if (divisorCount > threshold) {
        cerr << "Warning: High number of divisors leading to potential slowdown!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_range_invariant(int yi, int i, int threshold = 50) {
    if (yi > threshold) {
        cerr << "Warning: Large range for divisor checks detected!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_set_invariant(int setOperations, int threshold = 1000) {
    if (setOperations > threshold) {
        cerr << "Warning: Excessive set operations detected - potential bottleneck!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    comp.clear();
    cin >> n;
    for (int i = 0; i < (int)(n); i++) {
        cin >> x[i + 1] >> y[i + 1];
        // Check for large range
        check_range_invariant(y[i + 1], i + 1);
    }
    int totalSetOperations = 0; // Track set operations

    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        int divisorCount = 0;
        for (int j = 1; j < 318; j++) {
            if (x[i] % j == 0) {
                comp.insert(make_pair(j, i));
                int c = x[i] / j;
                comp.insert(make_pair(c, i));
                divisorCount += 2; // Increment for both divisors j and c
            }
        }
        // Check for high number of divisors
        check_divisor_invariant(divisorCount);

        int ans = 0;
        for (int j = 1; j < 318; j++) {
            if (x[i] % j) continue;
            if (x[i] > 1 && j == x[i]) break;
            if ((long long)j * (long long)j > x[i]) break;
            set<pair<int, int>>::iterator it = comp.lower_bound(make_pair(j, i));
            ++totalSetOperations; // Count the set operation

            if (it == comp.begin())
                ans++;
            else {
                it--;
                if (it->first != j || it->second < i - y[i]) {
                    ans++;
                }
            }
            if ((long long)j * (long long)j >= x[i]) break;
            int c = x[i] / j;
            if (c == j) continue;
            it = comp.lower_bound(make_pair(c, i));
            ++totalSetOperations; // Count the set operation

            if (it == comp.begin())
                ans++;
            else {
                it--;
                if (it->first != c || it->second < i - y[i]) {
                    ans++;
                }
            }
        }
        cout << ans << endl;
    }
    // Check for excessive set operations
    check_set_invariant(totalSetOperations);

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

- **Divisor Check**: After computing divisors, the program checks if the number exceeds a threshold (`100` in this case).
- **Range Check**: After reading each input, check if `yi` creates a large range.
- **Set Operations Check**: Keeps track of the number of `set` operations and checks if it exceeds a threshold (`1000`).

These checks are strategically placed to avoid unnecessary overhead and to catch performance bottlenecks effectively.
