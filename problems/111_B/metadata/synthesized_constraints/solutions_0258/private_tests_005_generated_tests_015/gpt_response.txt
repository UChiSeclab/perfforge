=== Invariants Response ===
To identify the performance bottlenecks in the provided C code, we need to analyze the line-level hit counts for both fast and slow inputs. Based on the problem statement and the code, here's how we can proceed:

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Line-level hit count analysis**:
   - **Line 15** (`for (int j = 1; j * j <= x; j++)`): This loop is executed 1901 times for the slow input, compared to 115 times for the fast input. This indicates frequent divisor computations for large values of `x`.
   - **Line 25** (`for (auto m : fact) {`): Executed 173 times for the slow input, compared to 40 times for the fast input. This loop iterates over the set of factors and seems to be a bottleneck.
   - **Line 33** (`for (auto m : fact) mm[m].insert(i);`): This line is hit 198 times on the slow input, compared to 44 times on the fast input. It updates a global map, which can become costly if the data structure grows large.

2. **Inference**:
   - The primary slowdown seems to be due to the computation of divisors (lines 15-18) and the frequent updates to the `unordered_map` (line 33).
   - The nested loop on line 25, which iterates over the set of divisors, indicates a combinatorial growth in complexity when more divisors are found.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the above analysis, we can derive the following performance-characterizing invariants in natural language:

1. **Invariant on Divisor Computation**:
   - **Natural Language Description**: "If the number `x` has many divisors, especially large prime factors leading to many iterations in the divisor computation loop, the program may slow down significantly."
   - **Explanation**: The bottleneck is the loop that calculates divisors. When `x` is large or has a high number of divisors, it increases computation cycles, impacting performance.

2. **Invariant on Map Updates**:
   - **Natural Language Description**: "When many factors are found for number `x` and stored in global data structures, the cumulative overhead of updates can degrade performance."
   - **Explanation**: Frequent updates to the `unordered_map` for each divisor result in overhead. If the set of factors is large, this adds significant time complexity.

3. **Invariant on Prior Divisor Checks**:
   - **Natural Language Description**: "If the divisor set for a number `x` is large and used frequently to check against previous divisor existence in the map, it may slow down computation."
   - **Explanation**: The loop checking previous divisors (line 25) can become costly if the number of divisors and entries in the map grow.

### Conclusion

These natural language invariants capture conditions leading to the observed performance degradation without relying on specific input values. They align with the constraints, namely, the size and properties of input numbers, and suggest where computational effort increases disproportionately. By identifying these critical conditions, we can guide optimizations or refactorings to avoid these slow-path scenarios.

=== Checker Response ===
### Phase 3: Implementing Performance-Characterizing Invariants as C++ Checkers

Based on the previously derived natural language invariants, here are the corresponding C++ checker implementations:

1. **Checker for Divisor Computation**:
   - This checker ensures that we don't have a number with too many divisors, indicating potential slow performance.

```cpp
void check_divisor_count_invariant(int divisorCount) {
    if (divisorCount > 1000) { // Arbitrary threshold based on potential high divisor counts
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to high divisor count!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

2. **Checker for Map Updates**:
   - This checker ensures the map isn't excessively large, which would impact performance.

```cpp
void check_map_size_invariant(const unordered_map<int, set<int>>& mm) {
    if (mm.size() > 50000) { // Arbitrary threshold based on potential growth
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to large map size!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

3. **Checker for Prior Divisor Checks**:
   - This checker ensures the divisor checks don't become too expensive.

```cpp
void check_prior_divisor_checks(size_t factorSize, const set<int>& fact) {
    if (factorSize > 500) { // Arbitrary threshold for factor size
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to extensive prior divisor checks!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrating Checkers into the Original C++ Code

Now, let's integrate these checkers into the original program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Checker for high divisor count
void check_divisor_count_invariant(int divisorCount) {
    if (divisorCount > 1000) { // Arbitrary threshold based on potential high divisor counts
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to high divisor count!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Checker for large map size
void check_map_size_invariant(const unordered_map<int, set<int>>& mm) {
    if (mm.size() > 50000) { // Arbitrary threshold based on potential growth
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to large map size!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Checker for extensive prior divisor checks
void check_prior_divisor_checks(size_t factorSize, const set<int>& fact) {
    if (factorSize > 500) { // Arbitrary threshold for factor size
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to extensive prior divisor checks!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

unordered_map<int, set<int> > mm;

int main(int argc, char const *argv[]) {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(0);
    cout.tie(0);

    int n;
    cin >> n;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        int x, y;
        cin >> x >> y;
        set<int> fact;

        int r = i - y, ans = 0;
        
        // Calculate divisors and check the count
        for (int j = 1; j * j <= x; j++) {
            if (x % j == 0) {
                fact.insert(j);
                if (x / j != j) fact.insert(x / j);
            }
        }

        check_divisor_count_invariant(fact.size()); // Check divisor count

        if (y == 0) {
            cout << (int)fact.size() << '\n';
        } else {
            int ans = 0;
            check_prior_divisor_checks(fact.size(), fact); // Check prior divisor usage

            for (auto m : fact) {
                int r = i - y;
                auto it = mm[m].lower_bound(r);
                if (it != mm[m].end() && *it >= r) continue;
                ans++;
            }
            cout << ans << '\n';
        }

        for (auto m : fact) mm[m].insert(i);

        check_map_size_invariant(mm); // Check map size
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

- **Divisor Count Check**: This check is placed right after the divisors are calculated to ensure they don't exceed a threshold that would slow down the performance.
- **Map Size Check**: This check is placed after updating the map to avoid excessive memory consumption.
- **Prior Divisor Check**: This check ensures that the set of factors doesn't grow too large, causing lengthy iterations. 

These checkers help identify performance bottlenecks during runtime, allowing a fuzzer or developer to detect problematic input scenarios.
