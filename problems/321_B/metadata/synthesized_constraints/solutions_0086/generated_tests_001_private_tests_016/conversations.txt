system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

Fox Ciel is playing a card game with her friend Jiro.

Jiro has n cards, each one has two attributes: position (Attack or Defense) and strength. Fox Ciel has m cards, each one has these two attributes too. It's known that position of all Ciel's cards is Attack.

Now is Ciel's battle phase, Ciel can do the following operation many times:

  1. Choose one of her cards X. This card mustn't be chosen before. 
  2. If Jiro has no alive cards at that moment, he gets the damage equal to (X's strength). Otherwise, Ciel needs to choose one Jiro's alive card Y, then: 
    * If Y's position is Attack, then (X's strength)  ≥  (Y's strength) must hold. After this attack, card Y dies, and Jiro gets the damage equal to (X's strength) - (Y's strength). 
    * If Y's position is Defense, then (X's strength)  > (Y's strength) must hold. After this attack, card Y dies, but Jiro gets no damage. 



Ciel can end her battle phase at any moment (so, she can use not all her cards). Help the Fox to calculate the maximal sum of damage Jiro can get.

Input

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of cards Jiro and Ciel have.

Each of the next n lines contains a string position and an integer strength (0 ≤ strength ≤ 8000) — the position and strength of Jiro's current card. Position is the string "ATK" for attack, and the string "DEF" for defense.

Each of the next m lines contains an integer strength (0 ≤ strength ≤ 8000) — the strength of Ciel's current card.

Output

Output an integer: the maximal damage Jiro can get.

Note

In the first test case, Ciel has 3 cards with same strength. The best strategy is as follows. First she uses one of these 3 cards to attack "ATK 2000" card first, this attack destroys that card and Jiro gets 2500 - 2000 = 500 damage. Then she uses the second card to destroy the "DEF 1700" card. Jiro doesn't get damage that time. Now Jiro has no cards so she can use the third card to attack and Jiro gets 2500 damage. So the answer is 500 + 2500 = 3000.

In the second test case, she should use the "1001" card to attack the "ATK 100" card, then use the "101" card to attack the "ATK 10" card. Now Ciel still has cards but she can choose to end her battle phase. The total damage equals (1001 - 100) + (101 - 10) = 992.

In the third test case note that she can destroy the "ATK 0" card by a card with strength equal to 0, but she can't destroy a "DEF 0" card with that card.

assistant: To analyze the provided C code and derive performance characterizing invariants, let's go through the phases described:

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Comparison of Line-Level Hit Counts:**
   - The lines within the `BellmanFord` function, particularly lines 41-49, exhibit significantly higher hit counts during the slow input run compared to the fast input. This indicates that the function is being called repeatedly and potentially processing a large number of edges in the graph.

2. **Pinpointing High Hit Count Lines:**
   - `Edge` constructor (lines 8-10) has high hit counts, suggesting frequent creation of edge objects, likely within the `addedge` function.
   - Lines within the `BellmanFord` function (41-49) are responsible for iterating over graph edges, with frequent updates to the shortest path estimates and queue operations.

3. **Interaction with Data Structures:**
   - The code utilizes a graph structure where each node is connected using edges. The `MCMF` (Minimum Cost Maximum Flow) algorithm involves augmenting paths and repeatedly adjusting flows, which is computationally intensive if the graph has a considerable number of nodes and edges.
   - The `addedge` function is extensively used to set up the flow network, indicating a dense graph structure.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the analysis from Phase 1, the following invariants can be derived:

1. **Invariant Related to Graph Size and Density:**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "If the number of possible edges in the flow network becomes large due to many attack and defense combinations, the graph operations may become computationally expensive, especially when iterating over edge lists."
   - **Threshold Suggestion:** Given `n, m ≤ 100`, a dense graph would imply `O(n*m)` edges, leading to `O((n*m)²)` complexity in worst case scenarios.

2. **Invariant Related to Iteration Over Edges:**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "When many edges have to be processed in Bellman-Ford's relaxation process, particularly with frequent updates causing reevaluations of shortest paths, it may lead to excessive computational overhead."
   - **Threshold Suggestion:** A high number of active nodes (near the maximum of 200) and edges (close to 4000, as `2*(n+m)`) can trigger excessive iterations.

3. **Invariant Related to Flow Adjustments:**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "If repeated adjustments to flow occur due to close strength values between many Ciel and Jiro's cards, additional complexity is introduced through the Bellman-Ford iterations."
   - **Threshold Suggestion:** Close strength values (large clusters of similar strengths) among cards can necessitate multiple flow adjustments, influencing performance.

### Output

Here are the performance-characterizing invariants as requested:

1. **Graph Density Invariant:**
   - "When constructing a dense network of edges between Ciel and Jiro's cards, performance may degrade due to the high number of potential connections to process."
   
2. **Edge Processing Invariant:**
   - "Excessive iterations over edges within Bellman-Ford's algorithm can slow down performance, particularly if many nodes repeatedly require shortest path reevaluations."

3. **Flow Adjustment Invariant:**
   - "Performance may slow significantly if Jiro's and Ciel's cards have close strength values, leading to frequent flow adjustments in the network."

These invariants provide a framework for understanding the conditions under which the program's performance may degrade, aligning with problem constraints and potential future scenarios.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
Fox Ciel is playing a card game with her friend Jiro.

Jiro has n cards, each one has two attributes: position (Attack or Defense) and strength. Fox Ciel has m cards, each one has these two attributes too. It's known that position of all Ciel's cards is Attack.

Now is Ciel's battle phase, Ciel can do the following operation many times:

  1. Choose one of her cards X. This card mustn't be chosen before. 
  2. If Jiro has no alive cards at that moment, he gets the damage equal to (X's strength). Otherwise, Ciel needs to choose one Jiro's alive card Y, then: 
    * If Y's position is Attack, then (X's strength)  ≥  (Y's strength) must hold. After this attack, card Y dies, and Jiro gets the damage equal to (X's strength) - (Y's strength). 
    * If Y's position is Defense, then (X's strength)  > (Y's strength) must hold. After this attack, card Y dies, but Jiro gets no damage. 



Ciel can end her battle phase at any moment (so, she can use not all her cards). Help the Fox to calculate the maximal sum of damage Jiro can get.

Input

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of cards Jiro and Ciel have.

Each of the next n lines contains a string position and an integer strength (0 ≤ strength ≤ 8000) — the position and strength of Jiro's current card. Position is the string "ATK" for attack, and the string "DEF" for defense.

Each of the next m lines contains an integer strength (0 ≤ strength ≤ 8000) — the strength of Ciel's current card.

Output

Output an integer: the maximal damage Jiro can get.

Examples

Input

2 3
ATK 2000
DEF 1700
2500
2500
2500


Output

3000


Input

3 4
ATK 10
ATK 100
ATK 1000
1
11
101
1001


Output

992


Input

2 4
DEF 0
ATK 0
0
0
1
1


Output

1

Note

In the first test case, Ciel has 3 cards with same strength. The best strategy is as follows. First she uses one of these 3 cards to attack "ATK 2000" card first, this attack destroys that card and Jiro gets 2500 - 2000 = 500 damage. Then she uses the second card to destroy the "DEF 1700" card. Jiro doesn't get damage that time. Now Jiro has no cards so she can use the third card to attack and Jiro gets 2500 damage. So the answer is 500 + 2500 = 3000.

In the second test case, she should use the "1001" card to attack the "ATK 100" card, then use the "101" card to attack the "ATK 10" card. Now Ciel still has cards but she can choose to end her battle phase. The total damage equals (1001 - 100) + (101 - 10) = 992.

In the third test case note that she can destroy the "ATK 0" card by a card with strength equal to 0, but she can't destroy a "DEF 0" card with that card.

Solution (C++ code):
{solution}


assistant: Certainly! Let's proceed with the two phases described to implement and integrate the performance-characterizing invariants as runtime checks.

### Phase 3: Implement the Invariants as C++ Checkers

#### 1. Graph Density Invariant
```cpp
void check_graph_density_invariant(int n, int m) {
    int edgeCount = (n + m) * m; // Maximum potential edges, considering attacks and defenses
    if (edgeCount > 10000) { // Hypothetical threshold for high density
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to high graph density!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

#### 2. Edge Processing Invariant
```cpp
void check_edge_processing_invariant(int nodeCount, int edgeCount) {
    if (nodeCount > 150 && edgeCount > 3000) { // Hypothetical thresholds for excessive edge processing
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to excessive edge processing!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

#### 3. Flow Adjustment Invariant
```cpp
void check_flow_adjustment_invariant(const vector<int>& cielStrengths, const vector<int>& jiroStrengths) {
    int closeStrengthPairs = 0;
    for (int cs : cielStrengths) {
        for (int js : jiroStrengths) {
            if (abs(cs - js) < 50) { // Threshold for close strength values
                closeStrengthPairs++;
            }
        }
    }
    if (closeStrengthPairs > 500) { // Hypothetical threshold for flow adjustments
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to frequent flow adjustments!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Graph Density Check:** This is inserted after reading inputs, before any edge creation.
- **Edge Processing Check:** This is inserted before setting up the graph for maximum flow calculation.
- **Flow Adjustment Check:** Ensures minimal flow adjustments by checking for close strength values before calculating the minimum cost flow.

These checks help to detect potential performance bottlenecks during runtime when certain conditions are met, providing early warnings about computationally expensive operations.
