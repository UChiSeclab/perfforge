system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

Fox Ciel is playing a card game with her friend Jiro.

Jiro has n cards, each one has two attributes: position (Attack or Defense) and strength. Fox Ciel has m cards, each one has these two attributes too. It's known that position of all Ciel's cards is Attack.

Now is Ciel's battle phase, Ciel can do the following operation many times:

  1. Choose one of her cards X. This card mustn't be chosen before. 
  2. If Jiro has no alive cards at that moment, he gets the damage equal to (X's strength). Otherwise, Ciel needs to choose one Jiro's alive card Y, then: 
    * If Y's position is Attack, then (X's strength)  ≥  (Y's strength) must hold. After this attack, card Y dies, and Jiro gets the damage equal to (X's strength) - (Y's strength). 
    * If Y's position is Defense, then (X's strength)  > (Y's strength) must hold. After this attack, card Y dies, but Jiro gets no damage. 



Ciel can end her battle phase at any moment (so, she can use not all her cards). Help the Fox to calculate the maximal sum of damage Jiro can get.

Input

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of cards Jiro and Ciel have.

Each of the next n lines contains a string position and an integer strength (0 ≤ strength ≤ 8000) — the position and strength of Jiro's current card. Position is the string "ATK" for attack, and the string "DEF" for defense.

Each of the next m lines contains an integer strength (0 ≤ strength ≤ 8000) — the strength of Ciel's current card.

Output

Output an integer: the maximal damage Jiro can get.

Note

In the first test case, Ciel has 3 cards with same strength. The best strategy is as follows. First she uses one of these 3 cards to attack "ATK 2000" card first, this attack destroys that card and Jiro gets 2500 - 2000 = 500 damage. Then she uses the second card to destroy the "DEF 1700" card. Jiro doesn't get damage that time. Now Jiro has no cards so she can use the third card to attack and Jiro gets 2500 damage. So the answer is 500 + 2500 = 3000.

In the second test case, she should use the "1001" card to attack the "ATK 100" card, then use the "101" card to attack the "ATK 10" card. Now Ciel still has cards but she can choose to end her battle phase. The total damage equals (1001 - 100) + (101 - 10) = 992.

In the third test case note that she can destroy the "ATK 0" card by a card with strength equal to 0, but she can't destroy a "DEF 0" card with that card.

assistant: Based on the provided C code, problem statement, and hit count information, I will analyze the performance bottlenecks and derive performance-characterizing invariants using natural language descriptions. 

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Function `memoize`**: This function is critical to the program's execution, and the hit counts suggest heavy use, particularly on line 5 (function call) and line 9 (cache check). The hit counts for the slow input are significantly higher than those for the fast input, indicating that this function is called recursively many times, especially in the slow case.

2. **Conditions Leading to Recursion**: The recursion depth and frequency seem driven by the conditions `cardlef != 0`, `atk < noatk && card[ceil] >= atkcard[atk]`, and `def < nodef && card[ceil] > defcard[def]`. The hit counts suggest these branches are more frequently explored with the slow input.

3. **Data Structure Impact**: The dynamic programming table `dp` is heavily accessed. The dimensions of this table are influenced by the sizes of `atkcard` and `defcard`, as well as the number of cards `m`. The presence of nested conditions and the extensive use of recursion contribute significantly to the slow performance.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **High Recursion Depth Due to Many Defensive Cards**: 
   - **Natural Language Description**: "When the number of Jiro's defensive cards (`nodef`) is high, the recursive exploration of potential attacks increases, leading to deeper recursion."
   - **Condition**: A high number of defensive cards (`nodef`) causes more checks and recursion paths, especially when Ciel's cards are too weak to easily bypass defenses.

2. **Limited Offensive Capability Against Strong Attack Cards**:
   - **Natural Language Description**: "If Ciel's cards are not substantially stronger than Jiro's attack cards, the recursive computation must explore numerous combinations to find viable attack strategies."
   - **Condition**: If the difference between the strongest Ciel attack cards and Jiro's attack cards is minimal, the recursion explores many possible attack sequences.

3. **Frequent Cache Misses in Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - **Natural Language Description**: "When there are insufficient matches in the dynamic programming cache due to varied input configurations, the program revisits many states, slowing down execution."
   - **Condition**: Cache misses become prevalent with diverse card strengths and positions, causing repeated work.

4. **Recursive Backtracking with Low-value Offensive Cards**:
   - **Natural Language Description**: "If Ciel has multiple low-strength cards, the need to backtrack and re-evaluate possible attacks increases, leading to a slower execution."
   - **Condition**: A large number of low-strength cards in Ciel's hand leads to frequent branch evaluations.

These invariants suggest areas where performance is likely to degrade. These insights can guide optimization efforts, such as improving the cache efficiency of the dynamic programming table or adjusting the recursive logic to reduce unnecessary state explorations, especially when faced with many defensive cards or low offensive power.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
Fox Ciel is playing a card game with her friend Jiro.

Jiro has n cards, each one has two attributes: position (Attack or Defense) and strength. Fox Ciel has m cards, each one has these two attributes too. It's known that position of all Ciel's cards is Attack.

Now is Ciel's battle phase, Ciel can do the following operation many times:

  1. Choose one of her cards X. This card mustn't be chosen before. 
  2. If Jiro has no alive cards at that moment, he gets the damage equal to (X's strength). Otherwise, Ciel needs to choose one Jiro's alive card Y, then: 
    * If Y's position is Attack, then (X's strength)  ≥  (Y's strength) must hold. After this attack, card Y dies, and Jiro gets the damage equal to (X's strength) - (Y's strength). 
    * If Y's position is Defense, then (X's strength)  > (Y's strength) must hold. After this attack, card Y dies, but Jiro gets no damage. 



Ciel can end her battle phase at any moment (so, she can use not all her cards). Help the Fox to calculate the maximal sum of damage Jiro can get.

Input

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of cards Jiro and Ciel have.

Each of the next n lines contains a string position and an integer strength (0 ≤ strength ≤ 8000) — the position and strength of Jiro's current card. Position is the string "ATK" for attack, and the string "DEF" for defense.

Each of the next m lines contains an integer strength (0 ≤ strength ≤ 8000) — the strength of Ciel's current card.

Output

Output an integer: the maximal damage Jiro can get.

Examples

Note

In the first test case, Ciel has 3 cards with same strength. The best strategy is as follows. First she uses one of these 3 cards to attack "ATK 2000" card first, this attack destroys that card and Jiro gets 2500 - 2000 = 500 damage. Then she uses the second card to destroy the "DEF 1700" card. Jiro doesn't get damage that time. Now Jiro has no cards so she can use the third card to attack and Jiro gets 2500 damage. So the answer is 500 + 2500 = 3000.

In the second test case, she should use the "1001" card to attack the "ATK 100" card, then use the "101" card to attack the "ATK 10" card. Now Ciel still has cards but she can choose to end her battle phase. The total damage equals (1001 - 100) + (101 - 10) = 992.

In the third test case note that she can destroy the "ATK 0" card by a card with strength equal to 0, but she can't destroy a "DEF 0" card with that card.

Solution (C++ code):

assistant: ### Phase 3: Implementing Natural Language Invariants in C++ Checker Code

Let's translate each of the performance-characterizing invariants into C++ checkers:

1. **High Recursion Depth Due to Many Defensive Cards**:
   ```cpp
   void check_defensive_cards_invariant(bool condition) {
       if (condition) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - too many defensive cards!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Limited Offensive Capability Against Strong Attack Cards**:
   ```cpp
   void check_offensive_capability_invariant(bool condition) {
       if (condition) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - Ciel's cards are not strong enough!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Frequent Cache Misses in Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   ```cpp
   void check_cache_efficiency_invariant(bool condition) {
       if (condition) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - frequent cache misses!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

4. **Recursive Backtracking with Low-value Offensive Cards**:
   ```cpp
   void check_backtracking_invariant(bool condition) {
       if (condition) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive backtracking with low-strength cards!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Integrating Checker Code into the Original C++ Program

Now, let's integrate these checkers into the provided C++ code, ensuring they are effectively triggered without adding overhead in tight loops. I'll insert the checks in appropriate places based on the previously identified bottlenecks.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int dp[109][109][109][5], m, noatk, nodef, atkcard[109], card[109], defcard[109];

void check_defensive_cards_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - too many defensive cards!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_offensive_capability_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - Ciel's cards are not strong enough!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_cache_efficiency_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - frequent cache misses!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_backtracking_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive backtracking with low-strength cards!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int memoize(int ceil, int atk, int def, int cardlef) {
    if (ceil == m && cardlef == 2 && (atk != noatk || def != nodef))
        return -1 * 10000000;
    if (ceil == m) return 0;
    if (dp[ceil][atk][def][cardlef] != -1) return dp[ceil][atk][def][cardlef];
    int ans = -1 * 10000000;

    // Check if the recursion is getting too deep with too many defensive cards
    check_defensive_cards_invariant(nodef > 80 && ceil < m / 2);

    if (cardlef != 0) ans = max(ans, card[ceil] + memoize(ceil + 1, atk, def, 2));
    if (atk < noatk && card[ceil] >= atkcard[atk])
        ans = max(ans, card[ceil] - atkcard[atk] + memoize(ceil + 1, atk + 1, def, cardlef));
    if (def < nodef && card[ceil] > defcard[def])
        ans = max(ans, memoize(ceil + 1, atk, def + 1, cardlef));
    if (def < nodef && cardlef != 2)
        ans = max(ans, memoize(ceil, atk, def + 1, 0));
    if (atk < noatk && cardlef != 2)
        ans = max(ans, memoize(ceil, atk + 1, def, 0));
    ans = max(ans, memoize(ceil + 1, atk, def, cardlef));

    // Check for frequent cache misses in the dynamic programming approach
    check_cache_efficiency_invariant((atk + def > 50) && (dp[ceil][atk][def][cardlef] == -1));

    return dp[ceil][atk][def][cardlef] = ans;
}

int main() {
    memset(dp, -1, sizeof(dp));
    int n;
    scanf("%d", &n);
    scanf("%d", &m);

    for (int i = int(0); i <= int(n - 1); i++) {
        string str;
        cin >> str;
        int val;
        scanf("%d", &val);
        if (str == "ATK")
            atkcard[noatk++] = val;
        else
            defcard[nodef++] = val;
    }

    sort(atkcard, atkcard + noatk);
    reverse(atkcard, atkcard + noatk);
    sort(defcard, defcard + nodef);
    reverse(defcard, defcard + nodef);

    for (int i = int(0); i <= int(m - 1); i++) scanf("%d", &card[i]);
    sort(card, card + m);
    reverse(card, card + m);

    // Check for limited offensive capability against strong attack cards
    check_offensive_capability_invariant((noatk > 0) && (card[0] < atkcard[noatk - 1]));

    // Check for excessive backtracking with low-value offensive cards
    check_backtracking_invariant((card[m - 1] < 100) && (m > 80));

    int ans = memoize(0, 0, 0, 1);
    printf("%d\n", ans);
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

- **Checker Functions**: Each invariant is translated into a checker function, with a condition based on the invariant's description.
- **Placement**:
  - The check for too many defensive cards is placed early in the `memoize` function to catch deep recursion.
  - The cache efficiency check is positioned where dynamic programming table accesses occur.
  - The offensive capability check is placed after sorting and organizing the cards, ensuring Jiro's strongest attack cards don't dominate.
  - The backtracking invariant check is positioned in `main` post-sorting, assessing if low-strength cards are prevalent.

These checks are designed to highlight potential bottlenecks and help identify problematic inputs during testing or fuzzing, without incurring significant runtime overhead during normal execution.
