system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

Fox Ciel is playing a card game with her friend Jiro.

Jiro has n cards, each one has two attributes: position (Attack or Defense) and strength. Fox Ciel has m cards, each one has these two attributes too. It's known that position of all Ciel's cards is Attack.

Now is Ciel's battle phase, Ciel can do the following operation many times:

  1. Choose one of her cards X. This card mustn't be chosen before. 
  2. If Jiro has no alive cards at that moment, he gets the damage equal to (X's strength). Otherwise, Ciel needs to choose one Jiro's alive card Y, then: 
    * If Y's position is Attack, then (X's strength)  ≥  (Y's strength) must hold. After this attack, card Y dies, and Jiro gets the damage equal to (X's strength) - (Y's strength). 
    * If Y's position is Defense, then (X's strength)  > (Y's strength) must hold. After this attack, card Y dies, but Jiro gets no damage. 



Ciel can end her battle phase at any moment (so, she can use not all her cards). Help the Fox to calculate the maximal sum of damage Jiro can get.

Input

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of cards Jiro and Ciel have.

Each of the next n lines contains a string position and an integer strength (0 ≤ strength ≤ 8000) — the position and strength of Jiro's current card. Position is the string "ATK" for attack, and the string "DEF" for defense.

Each of the next m lines contains an integer strength (0 ≤ strength ≤ 8000) — the strength of Ciel's current card.

Output

Output an integer: the maximal damage Jiro can get.

Note

In the first test case, Ciel has 3 cards with same strength. The best strategy is as follows. First she uses one of these 3 cards to attack "ATK 2000" card first, this attack destroys that card and Jiro gets 2500 - 2000 = 500 damage. Then she uses the second card to destroy the "DEF 1700" card. Jiro doesn't get damage that time. Now Jiro has no cards so she can use the third card to attack and Jiro gets 2500 damage. So the answer is 500 + 2500 = 3000.

In the second test case, she should use the "1001" card to attack the "ATK 100" card, then use the "101" card to attack the "ATK 10" card. Now Ciel still has cards but she can choose to end her battle phase. The total damage equals (1001 - 100) + (101 - 10) = 992.

In the third test case note that she can destroy the "ATK 0" card by a card with strength equal to 0, but she can't destroy a "DEF 0" card with that card.

assistant: ### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Hit Count Analysis:**
   - The function `minCostFlow` is executed more times in the slow input. Specifically, the lines inside this function, especially the loop starting at line 40, are hit significantly more times in the slow input compared to the fast input. This suggests that the algorithm spends a considerable amount of time exploring paths in the flow network for the slow input.
   - The loop in line 95 (`for (int j = 0; j < m; ++j)`) within `notKillAll` and `killAll` is also frequently accessed, indicating that nested loops with conditions on lines 96 and 118 contribute to high complexity.
   - The `addEdge` calls are notably frequent, suggesting substantial overhead associated with constructing the flow network.

2. **Data Structure Interaction:**
   - A significant number of operations involve checking conditions and adding edges based on the cards' strengths. The slow path likely involves complex combinations of conditions within nested loops interacting with the flow network.

3. **Algorithmic Complexity:**
   - The repeated calls and high hit counts in flow network-related operations suggest that the algorithm's complexity is heavily influenced by the number of possible combinations of Ciel's and Jiro's cards being processed under various conditions.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **Invariant 1: High Combination of Cards**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "The performance degrades significantly when there are many combinations of Ciel's and Jiro's cards that satisfy the attack conditions. Specifically, if the number of Ciel's cards is close to the maximum and multiple Jiro's cards can be targeted under different rules, the network flow construction suffers from overhead."
   
2. **Invariant 2: Nested Loops with Condition Complexity**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "The program encounters a slowdown when the nested loops processing card combinations involve complex conditions. This is particularly true when a large number of Ciel's cards must be evaluated against each of Jiro's cards to determine attack feasibility."

3. **Invariant 3: Recurring Flow Network Adjustments**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "When the algorithm frequently adjusts the flow network due to multiple feasible attack scenarios, the repeated edge additions and path evaluations cause the slowdown. This occurs when the ratio of Ciel's cards to Jiro's cards is high, leading to extensive network path exploration."

4. **Invariant 4: High Card Strength Variability**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "A wide variability in the strength of the cards can lead to increased complexity in decision-making, as more network paths need to be checked and adjusted for feasibility. This is exacerbated when the difference in strengths frequently triggers conditional branches."

These invariants aim to capture the performance bottlenecks by focusing on the structural complexity and interactions of card combinations with the flow network, particularly under constraints where `n` and `m` are both close to their upper limits.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
Fox Ciel is playing a card game with her friend Jiro.

Jiro has n cards, each one has two attributes: position (Attack or Defense) and strength. Fox Ciel has m cards, each one has these two attributes too. It's known that position of all Ciel's cards is Attack.

Now is Ciel's battle phase, Ciel can do the following operation many times:

  1. Choose one of her cards X. This card mustn't be chosen before. 
  2. If Jiro has no alive cards at that moment, he gets the damage equal to (X's strength). Otherwise, Ciel needs to choose one Jiro's alive card Y, then: 
    * If Y's position is Attack, then (X's strength)  ≥  (Y's strength) must hold. After this attack, card Y dies, and Jiro gets the damage equal to (X's strength) - (Y's strength). 
    * If Y's position is Defense, then (X's strength)  > (Y's strength) must hold. After this attack, card Y dies, but Jiro gets no damage. 



Ciel can end her battle phase at any moment (so, she can use not all her cards). Help the Fox to calculate the maximal sum of damage Jiro can get.

Input

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of cards Jiro and Ciel have.

Each of the next n lines contains a string position and an integer strength (0 ≤ strength ≤ 8000) — the position and strength of Jiro's current card. Position is the string "ATK" for attack, and the string "DEF" for defense.

Each of the next m lines contains an integer strength (0 ≤ strength ≤ 8000) — the strength of Ciel's current card.

Output

Output an integer: the maximal damage Jiro can get.

Examples

Input

2 3
ATK 2000
DEF 1700
2500
2500
2500


Output

3000


Input

101
1001


Output

992


Input

2 4
DEF 0
ATK 0
0

1
1


Output

1

Note

In the first test case, Ciel has 3 cards with same strength. The best strategy is as follows. First she uses one of these 3 cards to attack "ATK 2000" card first, this attack destroys that card and Jiro gets 2500 - 2000 = 500 damage. Then she uses the second card to destroy the "DEF 1700" card. Jiro doesn't get damage that time. Now Jiro has no cards so she can use the third card to attack and Jiro gets 2500 damage. So the answer is 500 + 2500 = 3000.

In the second test case, she should use the "1001" card to attack the "ATK 100" card, then use the "101" card to attack the "ATK 10" card. Now Ciel still has cards but she can choose to end her battle phase. The total damage equals (1001 - 100) + (101 - 10) = 992.

In the third test case note that she can destroy the "ATK 0" card by a card with strength equal to 0, but she can't destroy a "DEF 0" card with that card.

Solution (C++ code):
{solution}


assistant: ### Phase 3: Implementing Performance-Characterizing Invariants in C++

For each natural language invariant that we derived in Phase 2, we implement a corresponding runtime check in C++:

1. **Invariant 1: High Combination of Cards**
   - **C++ Checker Code:**
   ```cpp
   void check_high_combination_invariant(int n, int m) {
       if (n > 90 && m > 90) {
           cerr << "Warning: High combination invariant triggered - too many possible card combinations!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Invariant 2: Nested Loops with Condition Complexity**
   - **C++ Checker Code:**
   ```cpp
   void check_nested_loops_invariant(int conditionsMet) {
       if (conditionsMet > 5000) {
           cerr << "Warning: Nested loops invariant triggered - complex conditions met multiple times!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Invariant 3: Recurring Flow Network Adjustments**
   - **C++ Checker Code:**
   ```cpp
   void check_flow_adjustments_invariant(int flowAdjustments) {
       if (flowAdjustments > 10000) {
           cerr << "Warning: Flow adjustments invariant triggered - too many network path adjustments!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

4. **Invariant 4: High Card Strength Variability**
   - **C++ Checker Code:**
   ```cpp
   void check_strength_variability_invariant(int maxStrength, int minStrength) {
       if (maxStrength - minStrength > 7000) {
           cerr << "Warning: Strength variability invariant triggered - high difference in card strengths!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Integrating Checkers into the Original C++ Program

Now, let's integrate these checkers into the original C++ program, ensuring they are placed at effective points in the control flow:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// High combination of cards checker

        abort();
    }
}

// Nested loops with condition complexity checker
void check_nested_loops_invariant(int conditionsMet) {
    if (conditionsMet > 5000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Nested loops invariant triggered - complex conditions met multiple times!" << endl;

    }
}

    }
}

// High card strength variability checker

**Explanation:**
- **Invariant 1** checker is placed right after input is read, to ensure early detection of high card combination possibilities.
- **Invariant 2** checker counts conditions met during nested loop execution in `notKillAll` and checks after the loop.
- **Invariant 3** monitors the number of flow adjustments in `minCostFlow`, checking after the queue processing.
- **Invariant 4** checks strength variability after reading all card strengths.
