### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Line Hit Count Comparison:**
    - **Line 8:** `if (sum == y) break;` and subsequent lines (`13` and `14`) have extremely high hit counts for the slow input (`1000000000` times), indicating these lines are executed in a loop far more often than in the fast input.
    - This loop (lines 7-14) is directly tied to the `y` value, as it increments `sum` and `sum1` until `sum` equals `y` (line 8). The slow input requires the loop to iterate a billion times because `y` is `1000000000`, as opposed to the fast input where `y` is just `1`.

2. **Interaction with Data Structures:**
    - The loop is not interacting with complex data structures but is rather involved in inefficiently counting up to `y` using a simple increment operation (`sum++` and `sum1++`), which is computationally expensive due to its sheer number of iterations.

3. **Input Constraints Relation:**
    - The code's performance is directly influenced by the size of `y`. With `y` being `1000000000`, the loop runs excessively, causing the slowdown.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **Invariant Statement 1:** 
   "The program enters a slow execution path when the desired number of original toys `y` is significantly large, leading to numerous increment operations within a loop until `sum` matches `y`. This results in a high iteration count directly proportional to the magnitude of `y`."

2. **Invariant Statement 2:** 
   "When the initial difference between `y` and the starting count of original toys (1) is large, the program will have a prolonged loop execution, incrementing `sum` and `sum1` repeatedly, which causes the slowdown."

3. **Invariant Statement 3:** 
   "If both `x` and `y` are large, the calculation becomes computationally expensive, particularly when the loop designed to increase `sum` and `sum1` runs until `sum` equals `y`, exacerbated by a large `y` value."

4. **Threshold Suggestion:**
   "As `y` approaches the upper input constraint (e.g., values close to 10^9), ensure to reconsider the loop structure or logic to prevent excessive iteration counts that significantly impact performance."

These invariants describe how the combination of large values for `x` and `y`, particularly `y`, leads to inefficiencies due to excessive loop iteration. This characterization will help identify and adjust scenarios that trigger slowdowns.

### Phase 3: Implementing the Natural Language Invariants in C++

Let's translate the previously derived invariants into C++ code snippets that can be used as runtime checks:

```cpp
void check_large_y_invariant(int y) {
    if (y > 1e8) { // Threshold chosen to detect large y values that cause issues
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to large y!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_large_difference_invariant(int x, int y) {
    if ((y - 1) > 1e8) { // Large difference from the initial original toy count.
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to large y difference!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_large_x_and_y_invariant(int x, int y) {
    if (x > 1e8 && y > 1e8) { // Both x and y being large can cause inefficiencies
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to large x and y!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrating Checkers into the Original Program

Below is the instrumented C++ program with the performance checks integrated:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Checkers for performance bottleneck conditions
void check_large_y_invariant(int y) {
    if (y > 1e8) { // Threshold chosen to detect large y values
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to large y!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_large_difference_invariant(int x, int y) {
    if ((y - 1) > 1e8) { // Large difference from the initial original toy count.
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to large y difference!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_large_x_and_y_invariant(int x, int y) {
    if (x > 1e8 && y > 1e8) { // Both x and y being large can cause inefficiencies
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to large x and y!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    int x, y;
    cin >> x >> y;

    // Insert performance checkers here
    check_large_y_invariant(y);
    check_large_difference_invariant(x, y);
    check_large_x_and_y_invariant(x, y);

    int sum = 1, sum1 = 0;
    for (;;) {
        if (sum == y) break;
        if (sum > y) {
            cout << "No";
            return 0;
        }
        sum++;
        sum1++;
    }
    for (;;) {
        if (sum1 == x && sum == y) {
            cout << "Yes";
            return 0;
        }
        if (sum1 > x) {
            cout << "No";
            return 0;
        }
        if (sum1 > 0) sum1 += 2;
        if (sum1 == 0) {
            cout << "No";
            return 0;
        }
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:

- **Location of checks:** The checks are placed immediately after reading inputs. This ensures that the computation does not proceed if the input values indicate potential performance bottlenecks.
- **Thresholds:** The thresholds are set to values that would likely trigger performance issues (`1e8`), which helps in detecting problematic input patterns without relying solely on observed slow inputs.
- **Purpose of checks:** These checks help catch input patterns that could lead to excessive loop iterations due to large values or large differences in desired toy counts. They provide early warnings and terminate the program before performance can degrade significantly.
