=== Invariants Response ===
To address the problem, we need to analyze why the given C program runs slowly for certain inputs. The slow input is `1000001000 2`, while the fast input is `2 2`. The task is to determine performance-characterizing invariants that could explain the conditions under which the program exhibits slow behavior.

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Line-level Hit Count Analysis**:
   - The second `while` loop, starting at line 15, is the primary contributor to the high execution time for the slow input, with `500,000,501` hits, compared to just `2` hits for the fast input.
   - Specifically, the operations inside this loop, particularly the increment of `copies` by `2` (line 16) and the condition check (line 17), are executed excessively for the slow input.

2. **Code Interaction with Inputs**:
   - The expensive loop iterates while `copies < ctx` and `copies != 0`. The loop continues until `copies` matches `ctx` or the condition fails.
   - For the slow input (`ctx = 1000001000` and `oty = 2`), the loop repeatedly executes since the increment by `2` to reach `ctx` requires `500,000,500` iterations, with `copies` initially set to `1`.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the above analysis, we can derive the following performance-characterizing invariants:

1. **Invariant 1: Large `ctx` with Small `oty`**:
   - When the target number of copied toys (`ctx`) is very large, and the number of original toys (`oty`) is close to its initial value of `1`, the second `while` loop takes a long time to reach the condition where `copies` matches `ctx`.
   - **Natural Language Description**: "If the desired number of copied toys is significantly greater than the number of original toys, and the original toys are not increased substantially, the program may enter a slow path due to excessive iterations to match the copied toys count."

2. **Invariant 2: Small Increment Steps for Large Target**:
   - The program incurs slow performance when it has to perform a large number of small incremental steps (adding `2` to `copies`) to reach a large target `ctx`.
   - **Natural Language Description**: "If the target number of copies requires a large number of small incremental operations to be reached, such as repeatedly adding a small number to reach a large target, the program can become slow."

### Concise Set of Performance Invariants:

1. **Large Disparity Between `ctx` and `oty`**:
   - "When the desired number of copied toys is much larger than the number of original toys, and the original toys are nearly at their initial count, the program may slow down significantly due to prolonged copying processes."

2. **Inefficient Increment Strategy**:
   - "If the loop needs to perform numerous small increments to achieve the desired number of copies, the program may slow down, especially when these increments need to be repeated many times to reach a large target."

These invariants provide a general characterization of conditions that lead to slow execution without relying on specific numeric values from the inputs, ensuring they cater to potential future scenarios within the problem's constraints.

### Phase 3: Implement the Natural Language Invariants in C++

Let's transform the inferred invariants into actual runtime checks:

1. **Invariant 1: Large `ctx` with Small `oty`**:
   - **Natural Language**: "When the desired number of copied toys is much larger than the number of original toys, and the original toys are nearly at their initial count, the program may slow down significantly due to prolonged copying processes."
   - **C++ Checker Code**:
   ```cpp
   void check_large_ctx_small_oty(long long ctx, long long oty) {
       // Assuming a threshold where ctx is much larger than oty, and oty is close to initial 1
       if (ctx > 1000000 && oty <= 2) { // arbitrary threshold for demonstration
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - Large ctx with small oty!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Invariant 2: Small Increment Steps for Large Target**:
   - **Natural Language**: "If the target number of copies requires a large number of small incremental operations to be reached, such as repeatedly adding a small number to reach a large target, the program can become slow."
   - **C++ Checker Code**:
   ```cpp
   void check_small_increment_large_target(long long ctx, long long copies) {
       // Arbitrary threshold where many small increments would be needed
       if (ctx - copies > 1000000) { // arbitrary threshold for demonstration
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - Small increment towards large target!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Integrate Checks into Original Program

Now, we integrate these checks into the original C++ code. We will place them at strategic points to avoid excessive overhead, such as after reading inputs and before starting the heavy loops.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Checker function for large ctx with small oty
void check_large_ctx_small_oty(long long ctx, long long oty) {
    if (ctx > 1000000 && oty <= 2) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - Large ctx with small oty!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Checker function for small increment steps towards a large target
void check_small_increment_large_target(long long ctx, long long copies) {
    if (ctx - copies > 1000000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - Small increment towards large target!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    long long ctx, oty;
    cin >> ctx >> oty;

    // Check for the first invariant
    check_large_ctx_small_oty(ctx, oty);

    long long original = 1, copies = 0;
    while (original < oty) {
        copies++;
        original++;
    }

    if (original == oty && copies == ctx) {
        cout << "Yes" << endl;
        return 0;
    }

    // Check for the second invariant before starting the loop
    check_small_increment_large_target(ctx, copies);

    while (copies < ctx && copies != 0) {
        copies += 2;
        if (original == oty && copies == ctx) {
            cout << "Yes" << endl;
            return 0;
        }
    }

    cout << "No" << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of Integration

- The `check_large_ctx_small_oty` function is called immediately after reading inputs to catch any potential bottleneck early.
- The `check_small_increment_large_target` function is called right before the second loop to ensure that we do not enter an inefficient loop iteration process.
- Both checks include `cerr` warnings and `abort()` calls to notify and halt the program if the performance bottleneck conditions are met.
