system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

Imp likes his plush toy a lot.

<image>

Recently, he found a machine that can clone plush toys. Imp knows that if he applies the machine to an original toy, he additionally gets one more original toy and one copy, and if he applies the machine to a copied toy, he gets two additional copies.

Initially, Imp has only one original toy. He wants to know if it is possible to use machine to get exactly x copied toys and y original toys? He can't throw toys away, and he can't apply the machine to a copy if he doesn't currently have any copies.

Input

The only line contains two integers x and y (0 ≤ x, y ≤ 109) — the number of copies and the number of original toys Imp wants to get (including the initial one).

Output

Print "Yes", if the desired configuration is possible, and "No" otherwise.

You can print each letter in arbitrary case (upper or lower).

Examples

Note

In the first example, Imp has to apply the machine twice to original toys and then twice to copies.

assistant: To address the problem, we need to analyze why the given C program runs slowly for certain inputs. The slow input is `1000001000 2`, while the fast input is `2 2`. The task is to determine performance-characterizing invariants that could explain the conditions under which the program exhibits slow behavior.

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Line-level Hit Count Analysis**:
   - The second `while` loop, starting at line 15, is the primary contributor to the high execution time for the slow input, with `500,000,501` hits, compared to just `2` hits for the fast input.
   - Specifically, the operations inside this loop, particularly the increment of `copies` by `2` (line 16) and the condition check (line 17), are executed excessively for the slow input.

2. **Code Interaction with Inputs**:
   - The expensive loop iterates while `copies < ctx` and `copies != 0`. The loop continues until `copies` matches `ctx` or the condition fails.
   - For the slow input (`ctx = 1000001000` and `oty = 2`), the loop repeatedly executes since the increment by `2` to reach `ctx` requires `500,000,500` iterations, with `copies` initially set to `1`.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the above analysis, we can derive the following performance-characterizing invariants:

1. **Invariant 1: Large `ctx` with Small `oty`**:
   - When the target number of copied toys (`ctx`) is very large, and the number of original toys (`oty`) is close to its initial value of `1`, the second `while` loop takes a long time to reach the condition where `copies` matches `ctx`.
   - **Natural Language Description**: "If the desired number of copied toys is significantly greater than the number of original toys, and the original toys are not increased substantially, the program may enter a slow path due to excessive iterations to match the copied toys count."

2. **Invariant 2: Small Increment Steps for Large Target**:
   - The program incurs slow performance when it has to perform a large number of small incremental steps (adding `2` to `copies`) to reach a large target `ctx`.
   - **Natural Language Description**: "If the target number of copies requires a large number of small incremental operations to be reached, such as repeatedly adding a small number to reach a large target, the program can become slow."

### Concise Set of Performance Invariants:

1. **Large Disparity Between `ctx` and `oty`**:
   - "When the desired number of copied toys is much larger than the number of original toys, and the original toys are nearly at their initial count, the program may slow down significantly due to prolonged copying processes."

2. **Inefficient Increment Strategy**:
   - "If the loop needs to perform numerous small increments to achieve the desired number of copies, the program may slow down, especially when these increments need to be repeated many times to reach a large target."

These invariants provide a general characterization of conditions that lead to slow execution without relying on specific numeric values from the inputs, ensuring they cater to potential future scenarios within the problem's constraints.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
Imp likes his plush toy a lot.

<image>

Recently, he found a machine that can clone plush toys. Imp knows that if he applies the machine to an original toy, he additionally gets one more original toy and one copy, and if he applies the machine to a copied toy, he gets two additional copies.

Initially, Imp has only one original toy. He wants to know if it is possible to use machine to get exactly x copied toys and y original toys? He can't throw toys away, and he can't apply the machine to a copy if he doesn't currently have any copies.

Input

The only line contains two integers x and y (0 ≤ x, y ≤ 109) — the number of copies and the number of original toys Imp wants to get (including the initial one).

Output

Print "Yes", if the desired configuration is possible, and "No" otherwise.

You can print each letter in arbitrary case (upper or lower).

Examples

No


Input

1000 1001

Note

In the first example, Imp has to apply the machine twice to original toys and then twice to copies.

Solution (C++ code):
{solution}


assistant: ### Phase 3: Implement the Natural Language Invariants in C++

Let's transform the inferred invariants into actual runtime checks:

1. **Invariant 1: Large `ctx` with Small `oty`**:
   - **Natural Language**: "When the desired number of copied toys is much larger than the number of original toys, and the original toys are nearly at their initial count, the program may slow down significantly due to prolonged copying processes."
   - **C++ Checker Code**:
   ```cpp
   void check_large_ctx_small_oty(long long ctx, long long oty) {
       // Assuming a threshold where ctx is much larger than oty, and oty is close to initial 1
       if (ctx > 1000000 && oty <= 2) { // arbitrary threshold for demonstration
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - Large ctx with small oty!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Invariant 2: Small Increment Steps for Large Target**:
   - **Natural Language**: "If the target number of copies requires a large number of small incremental operations to be reached, such as repeatedly adding a small number to reach a large target, the program can become slow."
   - **C++ Checker Code**:
   ```cpp
   void check_small_increment_large_target(long long ctx, long long copies) {
       // Arbitrary threshold where many small increments would be needed
       if (ctx - copies > 1000000) { // arbitrary threshold for demonstration
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - Small increment towards large target!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Integrate Checks into Original Program

Now, we integrate these checks into the original C++ code. We will place them at strategic points to avoid excessive overhead, such as after reading inputs and before starting the heavy loops.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Checker function for large ctx with small oty
void check_large_ctx_small_oty(long long ctx, long long oty) {
    if (ctx > 1000000 && oty <= 2) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - Large ctx with small oty!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Checker function for small increment steps towards a large target
void check_small_increment_large_target(long long ctx, long long copies) {
    if (ctx - copies > 1000000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - Small increment towards large target!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    long long ctx, oty;
    cin >> ctx >> oty;

    // Check for the first invariant
    check_large_ctx_small_oty(ctx, oty);

    long long original = 1, copies = 0;
    while (original < oty) {
        copies++;
        original++;
    }

    if (original == oty && copies == ctx) {
        cout << "Yes" << endl;
        return 0;
    }

    // Check for the second invariant before starting the loop
    check_small_increment_large_target(ctx, copies);

    while (copies < ctx && copies != 0) {
        copies += 2;
        if (original == oty && copies == ctx) {
            cout << "Yes" << endl;
            return 0;
        }
    }

    cout << "No" << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of Integration

- The `check_large_ctx_small_oty` function is called immediately after reading inputs to catch any potential bottleneck early.
- The `check_small_increment_large_target` function is called right before the second loop to ensure that we do not enter an inefficient loop iteration process.
- Both checks include `cerr` warnings and `abort()` calls to notify and halt the program if the performance bottleneck conditions are met.
