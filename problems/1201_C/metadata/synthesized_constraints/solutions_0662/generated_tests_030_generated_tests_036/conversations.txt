system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

You are given an array a of n integers, where n is odd. You can make the following operation with it:

  * Choose one of the elements of the array (for example a_i) and increase it by 1 (that is, replace it with a_i + 1). 



You want to make the median of the array the largest possible using at most k operations.

The median of the odd-sized array is the middle element after the array is sorted in non-decreasing order. For example, the median of the array [1, 5, 2, 3, 5] is 3.

Input

The first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, n is odd, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9) — the number of elements in the array and the largest number of operations you can make.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9).

Output

Print a single integer — the maximum possible median after the operations.

Examples

Input


3 2
1 3 5


Output


5

Input


5 5
1 2 1 1 1


Output


3

Input


7 7
4 1 2 4 3 4 4


Output


5

Note

In the first example, you can increase the second element twice. Than array will be [1, 5, 5] and it's median is 5.

In the second example, it is optimal to increase the second number and than increase third and fifth. This way the answer is 3.

In the third example, you can make four operations: increase first, fourth, sixth, seventh element. This way the array will be [5, 1, 2, 5, 3, 5, 5] and the median will be 5.

(F) Program Solving the Problem Statement

#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int n, k, m, i;
int main() {
  cin >> n >> k;
  int a[200004];
  m = n / 2;
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) cin >> a[i];
  sort(a, a + n);
  for (i = a[m]; k > 0; i++) {
    while (i == a[m + 1]) m++;
    k = k - (m - n / 2 + 1);
  }
  if (k == 0)
    cout << i;
  else
    cout << i - 1;
}

} /* line 18 slow_hit_count: 1, fast_hit_count: 1 */


assistant: ### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

Upon analyzing the provided hit counts for both the slow and fast inputs, we can identify bottlenecks by comparing line-level hit counts:

1. **Line 10**: The loop condition `for (i = a[m]; k > 0; i++)` shows a significant difference in hit counts between the slow run (`290,113,174`) and the fast run (`156,334,394`). This loop is executed substantially more times in the slow run.

2. **Line 11**: The inner `while` loop `while (i == a[m + 1]) m++;` is also hit a similar number of times, suggesting that it is a contributing factor to the loop's inefficiency when the input is slow.

3. **Line 12**: The statement `k = k - (m - n / 2 + 1);` reduces `k` and is also a key part of this loop structure. Its high hit count indicates that `k` is decremented often, which can be tied to large `k` values and certain configurations of the array.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the code analysis and understanding of the problem statement, here are the performance-characterizing invariants:

1. **Large Initial Median and High `k`**:
   - **Natural Language Invariant**: "If the initial median of the array is relatively large and the number of operations `k` is also large, the loop will iterate many times to incrementally increase the median."
   - **Explanation**: This condition implies that as `k` is large, the potential to perform a high number of operations exists, and if these operations primarily target increasing already large median elements, the loop will execute many times.

2. **Small Gaps Between Consecutive Elements**:
   - **Natural Language Invariant**: "When consecutive elements around the median have small gaps, the inner while-loop is triggered frequently, causing inefficient looping."
   - **Explanation**: The `while` loop increases `m` when `i` is equal to `a[m+1]`, which means small differences between consecutive elements at and around the median can lead to frequent loop iterations without much change to the median.

3. **High Concentration Around the Median**:
   - **Natural Language Invariant**: "If many elements close to the median value exist, each increment impacts only a small number of array elements, requiring many repetitions to significantly change the median."
   - **Explanation**: When there are many elements with values near the median, each increment impacts few elements, causing many repeated iterations to achieve median increase, particularly when `k` is large.

These invariants help characterize the performance issues without relying on specific numeric values, focusing on key contributing factors like large operations allowance (`k`), initial median value, and array element distribution.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
You are given an array a of n integers, where n is odd. You can make the following operation with it:

  * Choose one of the elements of the array (for example a_i) and increase it by 1 (that is, replace it with a_i + 1). 



You want to make the median of the array the largest possible using at most k operations.

The median of the odd-sized array is the middle element after the array is sorted in non-decreasing order. For example, the median of the array [1, 5, 2, 3, 5] is 3.

Input

The first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, n is odd, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9) — the number of elements in the array and the largest number of operations you can make.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9).

Output

Print a single integer — the maximum possible median after the operations.

Examples

Input


3 2
1 3 5


Output


5

Input


5 5
1 2 1 1 1


Output


3

Input


7 7
4 1 2 4 3 4 4


Output

Note

In the first example, you can increase the second element twice. Than array will be [1, 5, 5] and it's median is 5.

In the second example, it is optimal to increase the second number and than increase third and fifth. This way the answer is 3.

In the third example, you can make four operations: increase first, fourth, sixth, seventh element. This way the array will be [5, 1, 2, 5, 3, 5, 5] and the median will be 5.

Solution (C++ code):
{solution}


assistant: ### Phase 3: Implement the Natural Language Invariants as C++ Checker Code

Below, I have translated the natural language invariants into C++ code snippets that serve as runtime checks to detect potential performance bottlenecks.

1. **Large Initial Median and High `k`**:

```cpp
void check_large_median_and_k(int medianValue, int k, int thresholdMedian, int thresholdK) {
    if (medianValue > thresholdMedian && k > thresholdK) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck - large initial median and high `k`!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

2. **Small Gaps Between Consecutive Elements**:

```cpp
void check_small_gaps(int* a, int m, int n, int thresholdGap) {
    for (int i = m - n / 2; i < m + n / 2; ++i) {
        if (a[i + 1] - a[i] < thresholdGap) {
            cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck - small gaps between consecutive elements!" << endl;
            abort();
        }
    }
}
```

3. **High Concentration Around the Median**:

```cpp
void check_high_concentration(int* a, int m, int n, int concentrationThreshold) {
    int count = 0;
    for (int i = m - n / 2; i < m + n / 2; ++i) {
        if (a[i] == a[m]) {
            count++;
        }
    }
    if (count > concentrationThreshold) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck - high concentration of elements around the median!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrate the Checker Code into the Original Program

Below is the instrumented C++ code incorporating the checkers at strategic points in the program to identify potential performance issues:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int n, k, m, i;

// Checkers from Phase 3
void check_large_median_and_k(int medianValue, int k, int thresholdMedian, int thresholdK) {
    if (medianValue > thresholdMedian && k > thresholdK) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck - large initial median and high `k`!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_small_gaps(int* a, int m, int n, int thresholdGap) {
    for (int i = m - n / 2; i < m + n / 2; ++i) {
        if (a[i + 1] - a[i] < thresholdGap) {
            cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck - small gaps between consecutive elements!" << endl;
            abort();
        }
    }
}

void check_high_concentration(int* a, int m, int n, int concentrationThreshold) {
    int count = 0;
    for (int i = m - n / 2; i < m + n / 2; ++i) {
        if (a[i] == a[m]) {
            count++;
        }
    }
    if (count > concentrationThreshold) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck - high concentration of elements around the median!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    cin >> n >> k;
    int a[200004];
    m = n / 2;
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) cin >> a[i];
    sort(a, a + n);
    
    // Insert checks after sorting and before entering the main loop
    check_large_median_and_k(a[m], k, 100000000, 500000000); // Example thresholds
    check_small_gaps(a, m, n, 10); // Small gap threshold example
    check_high_concentration(a, m, n, n / 10); // Concentration threshold example

    for (i = a[m]; k > 0; i++) {
        while (i == a[m + 1]) m++;
        k = k - (m - n / 2 + 1);
    }
    if (k == 0)
        cout << i;
    else
        cout << i - 1;
}
```

**Comments on Checker Integration:**

- *Large Initial Median and High `k`*: The check is placed after sorting, where `a[m]` is the initial median, to assess the potential for excessive iterations.
- *Small Gaps Between Consecutive Elements*: This check runs before the loop to predict inefficiency due to minimal differences between consecutive median-related elements.
- *High Concentration Around the Median*: This checker assesses concentration of median-like values, which might lead to slower increases in median value.

The thresholds used in the checkers are examples and should be adapted based on domain knowledge and further empirical tuning.
