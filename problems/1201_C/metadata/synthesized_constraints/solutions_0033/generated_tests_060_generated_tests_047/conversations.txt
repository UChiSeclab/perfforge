system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

You are given an array a of n integers, where n is odd. You can make the following operation with it:

  * Choose one of the elements of the array (for example a_i) and increase it by 1 (that is, replace it with a_i + 1). 



You want to make the median of the array the largest possible using at most k operations.

The median of the odd-sized array is the middle element after the array is sorted in non-decreasing order. For example, the median of the array [1, 5, 2, 3, 5] is 3.

Input

The first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, n is odd, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9) — the number of elements in the array and the largest number of operations you can make.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9).

Output

Print a single integer — the maximum possible median after the operations.

Examples

Input


3 2
1 3 5


Output


5

Input


5 5
1 2 1 1 1


Output


3

Input


7 7
4 1 2 4 3 4 4


Output


5

Note

In the first example, you can increase the second element twice. Than array will be [1, 5, 5] and it's median is 5.

In the second example, it is optimal to increase the second number and than increase third and fifth. This way the answer is 3.

In the third example, you can make four operations: increase first, fourth, sixth, seventh element. This way the array will be [5, 1, 2, 5, 3, 5, 5] and the median will be 5.

assistant: To analyze the code and its performance characteristics, let's walk through the problem-solving process step by step:

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Line-Level Hit Counts:**
   - The line with the most significant difference in hit counts between the slow and fast runs is line 36 (`while (el < arr[pos + 1])`), with over 322 million hits in the slow input versus approximately 129 million in the fast input.
   - Lines 37 to 40 (`k -= size;`, `if (k >= 0)`, `el++;`, and `maxmedian++;`) also show high hit counts directly related to line 36's loop.

2. **Code Analysis:**
   - The core of the problem lies in the nested loop structure, specifically the `while` loop starting on line 36, which iterates to increment `el` and adjust the median.
   - The `bin_search` function is called within a while loop to find the position `pos` of the next element greater than `el`, and this search is repeated whenever `k > 0`, which remains larger in the slow input.
   - The `size` variable increments based on the number of elements adjusted in the array, and this affects the loop's operation count significantly.

3. **Data Structure Interaction:**
   - The critical interaction is with the sorted array and the repeated adjustment of its elements using the available `k` operations.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the analysis above, here are some natural language performance invariants:

1. **Invariant on Operations and Loop Iterations:**
   - "The program may enter a slow execution path when the cumulative number of operations to increase the median (k operations distributed over array elements) repeatedly engages a nested loop far exceeding typical counts due to large median discrepancies among array elements."

2. **Invariant on Element Distribution:**
   - "If there is a significant difference between the median and the next largest set of elements, the program may slow down as the loop iterates many times to incrementally reach a higher median."

3. **Invariant on Key Differences in the Array:**
   - "When the array elements, specifically around the median, require numerous small increments to converge to the next element's value, the execution time increases sharply."

4. **Invariant on `k` Utilization:**
   - "Slowdown is likely when the total allowed operations (`k`) are not evenly distributed or are insufficiently large, resulting in excessive while-loop iterations for each possible increment in the median."

These invariants capture the essence of performance bottlenecks related to the problem's constraints, without relying on specific numeric values from the slow input. They are broad yet detailed enough to apply to other potential input scenarios that fit within the problem's constraints, like `n <= 2 ⋅ 10^5` and `k <= 10^9`.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
You are given an array a of n integers, where n is odd. You can make the following operation with it:

  * Choose one of the elements of the array (for example a_i) and increase it by 1 (that is, replace it with a_i + 1). 



You want to make the median of the array the largest possible using at most k operations.

The median of the odd-sized array is the middle element after the array is sorted in non-decreasing order. For example, the median of the array [1, 5, 2, 3, 5] is 3.

Input

The first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, n is odd, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9) — the number of elements in the array and the largest number of operations you can make.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9).

Output

Print a single integer — the maximum possible median after the operations.

Examples

Input


3 2
1 3 5


Output


5

Input


5 5
1 2 1 1 1


Output


3

Input


7 7
4 1 2 4 3 4 4


Output


5

Note

In the first example, you can increase the second element twice. Than array will be [1, 5, 5] and it's median is 5.

In the second example, it is optimal to increase the second number and than increase third and fifth. This way the answer is 3.

In the third example, you can make four operations: increase first, fourth, sixth, seventh element. This way the array will be [5, 1, 2, 5, 3, 5, 5] and the median will be 5.

Solution (C++ code):

Below are the C++ code snippets for the performance-characterizing invariants derived in Phase 2:

```cpp
// Invariant 1: Check for high loop iterations due to large discrepancies
void check_large_discrepancy_invariant(int iterations) {
    if (iterations > 100000000) { // Arbitrary threshold for excessive iterations
        cerr << "Warning: Large discrepancy causing excessive loop iterations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Invariant 2: Check for significant difference around the median
void check_median_difference_invariant(int median, int nextElement) {
    if (nextElement - median > 1000000) { // Arbitrary threshold for significant difference
        cerr << "Warning: Significant difference around median detected!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Invariant 3: Check for inefficient use of operations
void check_operations_usage_invariant(int k, int iterations) {
    if (k < iterations / 2) { // Arbitrary threshold; too many operations for iterations
        cerr << "Warning: Inefficient use of operations - possible performance bottleneck!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrate Checks into the Original Program

Now, let's integrate these invariants into the provided C++ program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Invariant 1: Check for high loop iterations due to large discrepancies
void check_large_discrepancy_invariant(int iterations) {
    if (iterations > 100000000) { // Arbitrary threshold for excessive iterations
        cerr << "Warning: Large discrepancy causing excessive loop iterations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Invariant 2: Check for significant difference around the median
void check_median_difference_invariant(int median, int nextElement) {
    if (nextElement - median > 1000000) { // Arbitrary threshold for significant difference
        cerr << "Warning: Significant difference around median detected!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Invariant 3: Check for inefficient use of operations
void check_operations_usage_invariant(int k, int iterations) {
    if (k < iterations / 2) { // Arbitrary threshold; too many operations for iterations
        cerr << "Warning: Inefficient use of operations - possible performance bottleneck!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int bin_search(int *arr, int l, int r, int key) {
    int mid;
    int ans = l;
    while (l < r) {
        mid = ((l + r) / 2) + 1;
        if (arr[mid] == key) {
            l = mid;
            ans = l;
        } else if (arr[mid] > key) {
            r = mid - 1;
        }
    }
    return ans;
}

int main() {
    int n, k;
    cin >> n >> k;
    int arr[n];
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        cin >> arr[i];
    }
    sort(arr, arr + n);
    int el = arr[n / 2];
    int pos = 0;
    int left = n / 2;
    int size = 0;
    int maxmedian = el;
    int totalIterations = 0; // Track total iterations for check

    while (k > 0) {
        pos = bin_search(arr, left, n - 1, el);
        if (pos == n - 1) {
            break;
        }
        size += pos - left + 1;
        
        // Check for significant difference around the median
        check_median_difference_invariant(el, arr[pos + 1]);

        while (el < arr[pos + 1]) {
            k -= size;
            if (k >= 0) {
                el++;
                maxmedian++;
                totalIterations++;
            } else {
                break;
            }
        }
        left = pos + 1;
        el = arr[left];
    }

    // Check for high loop iterations after processing
    check_large_discrepancy_invariant(totalIterations);

    if (k > 0) {
        maxmedian += k / ((n + 1) / 2);
    }

    // Check for inefficient use of operations before final output
    check_operations_usage_invariant(k, totalIterations);

    cout << maxmedian;
}
```

### Comments on the Integration

- **Line 36 (`while (el < arr[pos + 1])`)**: The loop where most of the processing occurs now includes counters and checks for:
  - The number of iterations to detect excessive looping due to large discrepancies.
  - The difference between the median and the next larger element.
- **Post-Loop Checks**: After the main processing loop, conditions are evaluated to ensure the function's integrity and to provide warnings if potential bottlenecks are identified.

This approach avoids adding significant runtime overhead to the program while highlighting potential performance issues, helping diagnose and avoid slow execution paths.
