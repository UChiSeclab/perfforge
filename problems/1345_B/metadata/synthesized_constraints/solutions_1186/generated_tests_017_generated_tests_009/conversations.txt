system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

A card pyramid of height 1 is constructed by resting two cards against each other. For h>1, a card pyramid of height h is constructed by placing a card pyramid of height h-1 onto a base. A base consists of h pyramids of height 1, and h-1 cards on top. For example, card pyramids of heights 1, 2, and 3 look as follows:

<image>

You start with n cards and build the tallest pyramid that you can. If there are some cards remaining, you build the tallest pyramid possible with the remaining cards. You repeat this process until it is impossible to build another pyramid. In the end, how many pyramids will you have constructed?

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1≤ t≤ 1000) — the number of test cases. Next t lines contain descriptions of test cases.

Each test case contains a single integer n (1≤ n≤ 10^9) — the number of cards.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^9.

Output

For each test case output a single integer — the number of pyramids you will have constructed in the end.

Note

In the first test, you construct a pyramid of height 1 with 2 cards. There is 1 card remaining, which is not enough to build a pyramid.

In the second test, you build two pyramids, each of height 2, with no cards remaining.

In the third test, you build one pyramid of height 3, with no cards remaining.

In the fourth test, you build one pyramid of height 3 with 9 cards remaining. Then you build a pyramid of height 2 with 2 cards remaining. Then you build a final pyramid of height 1 with no cards remaining.

In the fifth test, one card is not enough to build any pyramids.

assistant: To analyze the performance bottlenecks in the provided C program, we will compare the line-level hit counts for the slow and fast inputs, identify costly operations, and then derive natural language performance-characterizing invariants.

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

The given code constructs card pyramids and calculates how many can be built given `n` cards for multiple test cases. The primary steps are:

1. **Vector Initialization**: The vector `v` is initialized and filled with certain values calculated in a loop up to 25820 iterations. This loop is highly hit (over 2.5 million times for the slow input).
2. **Main Loop**: A loop iterates over the populated vector `v` from back to front to determine how many pyramids can be built for each test case.

**Key Observations:**
- The vector `v` is precomputed with a sequence of values, and this computation seems to be done redundantly for each test case.
- The hit counts for the vector initialization and filling (lines 13-16) are extraordinarily high compared to other lines, indicating that this is a significant factor in the slowdown.
- The loop over the vector `v` to calculate the number of pyramids (lines 19-21) also incurs many hits, but less so than the initialization loop.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the analysis above, we can formulate the following invariants to describe when the code's performance degrades:

1. **Redundant Precomputation of Vector**:
   - **Invariant**: "If the vector `v` is initialized multiple times for each test case, unnecessary computations occur, significantly affecting performance."
   - **Reasoning**: The vector `v` is calculated from scratch for each test case, which is inefficient given that its content doesn't depend on the test case input.

2. **Inefficient Use of Precomputed Values**:
   - **Invariant**: "If the computation for determining the number of pyramids requires iterating over a large, repetitively filled vector for each test case, this can lead to slow performance."
   - **Reasoning**: Iterating over the entire vector `v` for each test case is costly, especially when `n` is small and the number of cards doesn't necessitate examining all of `v`.

### Suggested Improvements

To improve the performance based on these invariants, the following changes can be considered:

1. **Precompute Vector Once**: Instead of computing the vector `v` for each test case, it should be computed once outside the test cases loop since it is invariant with respect to `n`.
   
2. **Optimize Pyramid Calculation**: Consider optimizing the algorithm that determines the number of pyramids by potentially stopping early if `n` becomes sufficiently small or by using a more direct mathematical approach rather than iterating over the entire vector.

By addressing these inefficiencies, the program can reduce redundant operations and improve overall performance, especially when handling a large number of test cases or smaller values of `n`.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
A card pyramid of height 1 is constructed by resting two cards against each other. For h>1, a card pyramid of height h is constructed by placing a card pyramid of height h-1 onto a base. A base consists of h pyramids of height 1, and h-1 cards on top. For example, card pyramids of heights 1, 2, and 3 look as follows:

<image>

You start with n cards and build the tallest pyramid that you can. If there are some cards remaining, you build the tallest pyramid possible with the remaining cards. You repeat this process until it is impossible to build another pyramid. In the end, how many pyramids will you have constructed?

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1≤ t≤ 1000) — the number of test cases. Next t lines contain descriptions of test cases.

Each test case contains a single integer n (1≤ n≤ 10^9) — the number of cards.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^9.

Output

For each test case output a single integer — the number of pyramids you will have constructed in the end.

Example

Input

3
14
15

Output

Note

In the first test, you construct a pyramid of height 1 with 2 cards. There is 1 card remaining, which is not enough to build a pyramid.

In the second test, you build two pyramids, each of height 2, with no cards remaining.

In the third test, you build one pyramid of height 3, with no cards remaining.

In the fourth test, you build one pyramid of height 3 with 9 cards remaining. Then you build a pyramid of height 2 with 2 cards remaining. Then you build a final pyramid of height 1 with no cards remaining.

In the fifth test, one card is not enough to build any pyramids.

Solution (C++ code):
{solution}


assistant: ### Phase 3: Implement the Invariants as Checker Code in C++

Let's translate the performance-characterizing invariants into C++ code snippets that can be used to detect potential bottlenecks at runtime.

1. **Redundant Precomputation of Vector**:
   - **Checker Code**: We can add a check to ensure the vector `v` is only computed once rather than repeatedly for each test case.
   
```cpp
void check_vector_precomputation(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Vector precomputation redundancy detected!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

2. **Inefficient Use of Precomputed Values**:
   - **Checker Code**: We can add a check to ensure that the loop over the vector `v` isn't unnecessarily iterating over more entries than needed.

```cpp
void check_iteration_efficiency(int n, int iter_count) {
    if (iter_count > n) { // Assuming iterating more than n times is inefficient
        cerr << "Warning: Inefficient iteration over vector detected!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrate the Checker Code into the Original Program

We'll now integrate these checks into the original program, ensuring they are placed at appropriate locations to identify bottlenecks without introducing additional performance overhead.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
const long long Max = 1000000000;

// Checkers for performance invariants
void check_vector_precomputation(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Vector precomputation redundancy detected!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_iteration_efficiency(int n, int iter_count) {
    if (iter_count > n) { // Assuming iterating more than n times is inefficient
        cerr << "Warning: Inefficient iteration over vector detected!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    int t;
    cin >> t;
    
    // Precompute the vector `v` once
    vector<long long> v;
    long long x = 5;
    v.push_back(2);
    for (long long i = 1; i <= 25820; i++) {
        long long k = v[v.size() - 1] + x;
        v.push_back(k);
        x += 3;
    }
    
    // Check for redundant precomputation of vector
    check_vector_precomputation(v.size() > 0); // Should only be precomputed once
    
    while (t--) {
        long long n;
        cin >> n;
        int cnt = 0;
        
        // Start counting the number of pyramids
        int iter_count = 0; // Count number of iterations for efficiency check
        for (int i = v.size() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            cnt += (n / v[i]);
            n = (n - (n / v[i] * v[i]));
            iter_count++;
        }
        
        // Check for inefficient iterations over vector
        check_iteration_efficiency(n, iter_count);
        
        cout << cnt << endl;
    }
}
```

### Explanation
- **Vector Precomputation**: The vector `v` is computed once before entering the test case loop, and the check ensures this operation isn't repeated redundantly.
- **Iteration Efficiency**: We added a counter `iter_count` to count iterations over `v` and check if it's excessive relative to `n`, assuming too many iterations might be inefficient.

By placing these checks, the program can alert us to potential inefficiencies and abort execution if conditions indicative of a bottleneck are met. This setup helps identify issues during testing or with unexpected input patterns.
