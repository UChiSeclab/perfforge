system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

Calculate the number of ways to place n rooks on n × n chessboard so that both following conditions are met:

  * each empty cell is under attack; 
  * exactly k pairs of rooks attack each other. 



An empty cell is under attack if there is at least one rook in the same row or at least one rook in the same column. Two rooks attack each other if they share the same row or column, and there are no other rooks between them. For example, there are only two pairs of rooks that attack each other in the following picture:

<image> One of the ways to place the rooks for n = 3 and k = 2

Two ways to place the rooks are considered different if there exists at least one cell which is empty in one of the ways but contains a rook in another way.

The answer might be large, so print it modulo 998244353.

Input

The only line of the input contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000; 0 ≤ k ≤ (n(n - 1))/(2)).

Output

Print one integer — the number of ways to place the rooks, taken modulo 998244353.

assistant: ### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

Upon examining the hit counts, we observe the following:

- **Lines with Non-zero Hit Counts**:
  - Line 74: `int main()` (entry point)
  - Line 75: `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);` (setting up fast I/O)
  - Line 76: `cin.tie(0);` (another fast I/O setup)
  - Line 79: `cin >> n >> k;` (input reading)
  - Line 80: `if (k >= n) return cout << 0 << '\n', 0;` (early exit for certain conditions)

- There are no other lines with hits, indicating the code for the slow input is not proceeding past the input reading and the initial conditional check. Specifically, the loop at line 82 and the factorial computations in function `fat` are not triggered for the slow input.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on this analysis, the following performance-characterizing invariants can be derived:

1. **Invariant 1: Early Exit Condition**  
   - **Natural Language Description**: "If the problem constraints (`k >= n`) are met directly, the program exits early without significant computation, leading to a fast execution."
   - **Explanation**: For the fast input, `k` equals `n`, which directly triggers the early exit condition at line 80. This avoids any further computation, providing a quick response.

2. **Invariant 2: Complexity of Combinatorial Calculations**  
   - **Natural Language Description**: "When `k` is significantly smaller than `n`, the program avoids complex combinatorial calculations and loops, which would otherwise increase runtime significantly."
   - **Explanation**: The slow input has `k = 0`, meaning the loop `for (int i = n - k; i + 1; i--)` runs from a high value down to 0. This situation triggers complex calculations involving combinations and powers, causing a slowdown.

3. **Invariant 3: Factorial Computation Cost**  
   - **Natural Language Description**: "If the factorial or combinatorial function is invoked with large parameters, it may lead to performance bottlenecks due to repeated calculations."
   - **Explanation**: The function `C(int n, int k)` involves factorial computations. If reached with large `n` and `k` values, this could significantly impact performance.

4. **Invariant 4: Power Computation**  
   - **Natural Language Description**: "If the power function is invoked frequently with large exponents, it can contribute to increased execution time."
   - **Explanation**: The expression `(mod_int<998244353>(i) ^ n)` involves powering operations, which become expensive if executed many times inside a loop.

These invariants give insights into potential performance bottlenecks. They provide guidance on which parts of the code may require optimization under different input scenarios within the given constraints.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
Calculate the number of ways to place n rooks on n × n chessboard so that both following conditions are met:

  * each empty cell is under attack; 
  * exactly k pairs of rooks attack each other. 



An empty cell is under attack if there is at least one rook in the same row or at least one rook in the same column. Two rooks attack each other if they share the same row or column, and there are no other rooks between them. For example, there are only two pairs of rooks that attack each other in the following picture:

<image> One of the ways to place the rooks for n = 3 and k = 2

Two ways to place the rooks are considered different if there exists at least one cell which is empty in one of the ways but contains a rook in another way.

The answer might be large, so print it modulo 998244353.

Input

The only line of the input contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000; 0 ≤ k ≤ (n(n - 1))/(2)).

Output

Print one integer — the number of ways to place the rooks, taken modulo 998244353.

assistant: ### Phase 3: Implementing the Performance-Characterizing Invariants in C++

Here we implement checkers based on the natural language invariants derived previously. Each checker will verify a condition that, when met, signals a potential performance bottleneck.

1. **Invariant 1: Early Exit Condition**

```cpp
void check_early_exit_condition(int k, int n) {
    if (k >= n) {
        cerr << "Warning: Early exit condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

2. **Invariant 2: Complexity of Combinatorial Calculations**

```cpp
void check_combinatorial_complexity(int k, int n) {
    int threshold = n / 2; // Example threshold, can be adjusted
    if (k < threshold) {
        cerr << "Warning: High combinatorial complexity due to large n with small k!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

3. **Invariant 3: Factorial Computation Cost**

```cpp
void check_factorial_computation(int n) {
    int threshold = 100000; // An arbitrary large threshold
    if (n > threshold) {
        cerr << "Warning: Large factorial computation!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

4. **Invariant 4: Power Computation**

```cpp
void check_power_computation(int n, int i) {
    int threshold = 100000; // An arbitrary large threshold
    if (n > threshold && i > threshold) {
        cerr << "Warning: Expensive power computation!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrating Checkers into the Original C++ Code

Now, we integrate these checkers into the given C++ program at appropriate points. We should ensure that each check is placed to avoid unnecessary overhead.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
const int INF = 0x3f3f3f3f;
const long long LINF = 0x3f3f3f3f3f3f3f3fll;

template <int p>
struct mod_int {
  long long pow(long long b, long long e) {
    if (e == 0) return 1;
    long long r = pow(b * b % p, e / 2);
    if (e % 2 == 1) r = (r * b) % p;
    return r;
  }
  long long inv(long long b) { return pow(b, p - 2); }
  using m = mod_int;
  long long v;
  mod_int() {}
  mod_int(long long v_) : v(v_) {
    if (v >= p || v <= -p) v %= p;
    if (v < 0) v += p;
  }
  m &operator+=(const m &a) {
    v += a.v;
    if (v >= p) v -= p;
    return *this;
  }
  m &operator-=(const m &a) {
    v -= a.v;
    if (v < 0) v += p;
    return *this;
  }
  m &operator*=(const m &a) {
    v = (v * a.v) % p;
    return *this;
  }
  m &operator/=(const m &a) {
    v = (v * inv(a.v)) % p;
    return *this;
  }
  m operator-() { return m(-v); }
  m &operator^=(long long e) {
    if (e < 0) {
      v = inv(v);
      e = -e;
    }
    v = pow(v, e % (p - 1));
    return *this;
  }
  bool operator==(const m &a) { return v == a.v; }
  bool operator!=(const m &a) { return v != a.v; }
  friend istream &operator>>(istream &in, m &a) {
    long long val;
    in >> val;
    a = m(val);
    return in;
  }
  friend ostream &operator<<(ostream &out, m a) { return out << a.v; }
  friend m operator+(m a, m b) { return a += b; }
  friend m operator-(m a, m b) { return a -= b; }
  friend m operator*(m a, m b) { return a *= b; }
  friend m operator/(m a, m b) { return a /= b; }
  friend m operator^(m a, long long e) { return a ^= e; }
};

vector<mod_int<998244353> > fatt;
mod_int<998244353> fat(int n) {
  if (n < fatt.size()) return fatt[n];
  if (!n)
    fatt.push_back(1);
  else
    fatt.push_back(n * fat(n - 1));
  return fatt.back();
}

const int MAX = 2e5 + 10;
mod_int<998244353> C(int n, int k) { return fat(n) / fat(k) / fat(n - k); }

// Checkers
void check_early_exit_condition(int k, int n) {
    if (k >= n) {
        cerr << "Warning: Early exit condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_combinatorial_complexity(int k, int n) {
    int threshold = n / 2; // Example threshold
    if (k < threshold) {
        cerr << "Warning: High combinatorial complexity due to large n with small k!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_factorial_computation(int n) {
    int threshold = 100000; // Threshold for factorial computation
    if (n > threshold) {
        cerr << "Warning: Large factorial computation!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_power_computation(int n, int i) {
    int threshold = 100000; // Threshold for power computation
    if (n > threshold && i > threshold) {
        cerr << "Warning: Expensive power computation!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
  cin.tie(0);
  int n;
  long long k;
  cin >> n >> k;

  // Insert checkers after reading inputs
  check_early_exit_condition(k, n);
  check_combinatorial_complexity(k, n);
  check_factorial_computation(n);

  if (k >= n) return cout << 0 << '\n', 0;

  mod_int<998244353> ans = 0;

  for (int i = n - k; i + 1; i--) {
    check_power_computation(n, i); // Power computation check inside loop
    mod_int<998244353> add = C(n - k, i) * (mod_int<998244353>(i) ^ n);
    if (i % 2 == (n - k) % 2)
      ans += add;
    else
      ans -= add;
  }

  if (k) ans *= 2;
  cout << ans * C(n, n - k) << '\n';
  exit(0);
}
```

### Explanation

- **Checkers**: Implemented and inserted checkers for each invariant at strategic points (e.g., after input reading and before loops).
- **Avoidance of Overhead**: The checks are placed outside of tight loops where possible to minimize overhead.
- **Thresholds**: Used reasonable thresholds to check conditions that might lead to performance degradation. These can be tuned based on empirical testing and profiling.

This instrumented code will now alert and abort when a performance bottleneck condition is triggered, helping in debugging and optimization efforts.
