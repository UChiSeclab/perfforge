=== Invariants Response ===
To diagnose the performance bottleneck in this C program, we will analyze the given hit counts and derive performance-characterizing invariants.

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Line Hit Count Analysis:**
   - The function `pwr` (lines 4-11) is heavily utilized during the slow input but not at all during the fast input.
   - Lines 26-29 show a significant number of iterations, indicating the computation of factorials up to a large number, which contributes to setup overhead.
   - The loop from line 34 to 40 is executed 200,001 times for the slow input, indicating that this loop is a major contributor to the slowdown.

2. **Inference on Code Structure:**
   - The power function `pwr` is called within the loop (line 35) for each iteration of the loop over `k` (which equals `n` for slow input). This implies high computational cost due to recalculating powers repeatedly.
   - The factorial array computation is independent of the input size but contributes to constant setup time.
   - The combinatorial calculation `ncr` (lines 30-32) is used repeatedly, which could compound the cost when coupled with power calculations in the loop.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **Invariant 1: Repeated Power Calculations**
   - **Natural Language Description:** If the number of rooks `k` is close to the board size `n`, resulting in repeated power calculations across the board size, the code may significantly slow down.
   - **Reasoning:** As `k` approaches `n`, the loop executes more iterations, and the function `pwr` is called multiple times, each with a large exponent, leading to compounded computational cost.

2. **Invariant 2: Combinatorial and Factorial Overhead**
   - **Natural Language Description:** When the number of solutions involves computing combinatorial values with large parameters, the initialization overhead of factorial computations becomes significant.
   - **Reasoning:** The need to initialize factorials up to a large number adds setup time, which, while constant, becomes more pronounced in conjunction with large `k`.

3. **Invariant 3: Loop Intensive Calculations**
   - **Natural Language Description:** If the loop iterates with an upper bound close to `n`, with each iteration involving complex mathematical operations, the performance may degrade significantly.
   - **Reasoning:** The loop from line 34-40 iterates `n` times, and each iteration involves a costly combination of `ncr` and `pwr` calculations, leading to extensive computation when `k` is large.

These invariants abstractly describe the conditions under which the code transitions into a slow path, focusing on the relationship between `k`, `n`, and computational intensity of nested mathematical operations. They help pinpoint the algorithmic paths that cause performance degradation, providing guidance for both optimization and testing frameworks to detect and mitigate such slow conditions.

=== Checker Response ===
### Phase 3: Implement the Natural Language Invariants as C++ Checker Code

For each performance-characterizing invariant, we implement a checker function. These checkers will help identify when performance bottlenecks are triggered based on the conditions derived from the analysis.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Checker for repeated power calculations
void check_repeated_power_calculations(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to repeated power calculations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Checker for combinatorial and factorial overhead
void check_combinatorial_overhead(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to large combinatorial calculations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Checker for loop-intensive calculations
void check_loop_intensive_calculations(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to intensive loop calculations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Insert Conditional Checks into the Original Program

We will integrate the checker functions into the original program. These checks will be placed strategically to avoid adding unnecessary overhead within loops.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
const int M = 998244353;

// Function to compute power modulo M
long long pwr(long long a, long long b, long long m = M) {
  long long ret = 1;
  while (b > 0) {
    if (b & 1) ret = ret * a % m;
    a = a * a % m;
    b >>= 1;
  }
  return ret;
}

// Checker for repeated power calculations
void check_repeated_power_calculations(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to repeated power calculations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Checker for combinatorial and factorial overhead
void check_combinatorial_overhead(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to large combinatorial calculations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Checker for loop-intensive calculations
void check_loop_intensive_calculations(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to intensive loop calculations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cout.tie(nullptr);
  cin.tie(nullptr);
  long long n, k;
  cin >> n >> k;

  // Check for performance bottlenecks based on input conditions
  check_repeated_power_calculations(k == 0);  // Check if k is 0, leading to high power calculations
  check_combinatorial_overhead(n >= 100000);  // Check if n is very large, causing overhead
  check_loop_intensive_calculations(n == k);  // Check if n equals k, triggering full loop iterations

  if (k >= n) {
    cout << 0 << '\n';
    return 0;
  }
  k = n - k;
  vector<long long> fac(5e5), inv = fac;
  inv[0] = fac[0] = 1;
  for (int i = 1; i < 5e5; ++i) {
    fac[i] = i * fac[i - 1] % M;
    inv[i] = pwr(fac[i], M - 2);
  }
  auto ncr = [&](int nn, int rr) {
    return (fac[nn] * (inv[rr] * inv[nn - rr] % M) % M);
  };
  long long ans = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < k; ++i) {
    long long cur = ncr(k, i) * pwr(k - i, n) % M;
    if (i & 1)
      ans = (ans - cur + M) % M;
    else
      ans = (ans + cur) % M;
  }
  ans = ans * ncr(n, k) % M;
  if (k != n) ans = ans * 2 % M;
  cout << ans << '\n';
}
```

### Description of Inserted Checks

1. **Repeated Power Calculations Check:**
   - **Purpose:** Detects when `k` is 0, causing repeated power calculations as the loop iterates with maximum `n`.
   - **Placement:** After reading inputs, before any heavy computation begins.

2. **Combinatorial Overhead Check:**
   - **Purpose:** Warns when `n` is very large, causing excessive factorial setup overhead.
   - **Placement:** After reading inputs, ensuring that the setup is not unduly triggered.

3. **Loop-Intensive Calculations Check:**
   - **Purpose:** Identifies when `n` equals `k`, leading to exhaustive looping and computation.
   - **Placement:** Immediately after input validation to preemptively catch heavy-loop scenarios.

These checks are strategically placed to run prior to the main computation, thus avoiding additional overhead during the performance-critical sections of the program.
