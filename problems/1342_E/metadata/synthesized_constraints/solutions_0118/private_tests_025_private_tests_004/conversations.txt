system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

Calculate the number of ways to place n rooks on n × n chessboard so that both following conditions are met:

  * each empty cell is under attack; 
  * exactly k pairs of rooks attack each other. 



An empty cell is under attack if there is at least one rook in the same row or at least one rook in the same column. Two rooks attack each other if they share the same row or column, and there are no other rooks between them. For example, there are only two pairs of rooks that attack each other in the following picture:

<image> One of the ways to place the rooks for n = 3 and k = 2

Two ways to place the rooks are considered different if there exists at least one cell which is empty in one of the ways but contains a rook in another way.

The answer might be large, so print it modulo 998244353.

Input

The only line of the input contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000; 0 ≤ k ≤ (n(n - 1))/(2)).

Output

Print one integer — the number of ways to place the rooks, taken modulo 998244353.

assistant: To diagnose the performance bottleneck in this C program, we will analyze the given hit counts and derive performance-characterizing invariants.

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Line Hit Count Analysis:**
   - The function `pwr` (lines 4-11) is heavily utilized during the slow input but not at all during the fast input.
   - Lines 26-29 show a significant number of iterations, indicating the computation of factorials up to a large number, which contributes to setup overhead.
   - The loop from line 34 to 40 is executed 200,001 times for the slow input, indicating that this loop is a major contributor to the slowdown.

2. **Inference on Code Structure:**
   - The power function `pwr` is called within the loop (line 35) for each iteration of the loop over `k` (which equals `n` for slow input). This implies high computational cost due to recalculating powers repeatedly.
   - The factorial array computation is independent of the input size but contributes to constant setup time.
   - The combinatorial calculation `ncr` (lines 30-32) is used repeatedly, which could compound the cost when coupled with power calculations in the loop.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **Invariant 1: Repeated Power Calculations**
   - **Natural Language Description:** If the number of rooks `k` is close to the board size `n`, resulting in repeated power calculations across the board size, the code may significantly slow down.
   - **Reasoning:** As `k` approaches `n`, the loop executes more iterations, and the function `pwr` is called multiple times, each with a large exponent, leading to compounded computational cost.

2. **Invariant 2: Combinatorial and Factorial Overhead**
   - **Natural Language Description:** When the number of solutions involves computing combinatorial values with large parameters, the initialization overhead of factorial computations becomes significant.
   - **Reasoning:** The need to initialize factorials up to a large number adds setup time, which, while constant, becomes more pronounced in conjunction with large `k`.

3. **Invariant 3: Loop Intensive Calculations**
   - **Natural Language Description:** If the loop iterates with an upper bound close to `n`, with each iteration involving complex mathematical operations, the performance may degrade significantly.
   - **Reasoning:** The loop from line 34-40 iterates `n` times, and each iteration involves a costly combination of `ncr` and `pwr` calculations, leading to extensive computation when `k` is large.

These invariants abstractly describe the conditions under which the code transitions into a slow path, focusing on the relationship between `k`, `n`, and computational intensity of nested mathematical operations. They help pinpoint the algorithmic paths that cause performance degradation, providing guidance for both optimization and testing frameworks to detect and mitigate such slow conditions.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
Calculate the number of ways to place n rooks on n × n chessboard so that both following conditions are met:

  * each empty cell is under attack; 
  * exactly k pairs of rooks attack each other. 



An empty cell is under attack if there is at least one rook in the same row or at least one rook in the same column. Two rooks attack each other if they share the same row or column, and there are no other rooks between them. For example, there are only two pairs of rooks that attack each other in the following picture:

<image> One of the ways to place the rooks for n = 3 and k = 2

Two ways to place the rooks are considered different if there exists at least one cell which is empty in one of the ways but contains a rook in another way.

The answer might be large, so print it modulo 998244353.

Input

The only line of the input contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000; 0 ≤ k ≤ (n(n - 1))/(2)).

Output

Print one integer — the number of ways to place the rooks, taken modulo 998244353.

assistant: ### Phase 3: Implement the Natural Language Invariants as C++ Checker Code

For each performance-characterizing invariant, we implement a checker function. These checkers will help identify when performance bottlenecks are triggered based on the conditions derived from the analysis.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Checker for repeated power calculations
void check_repeated_power_calculations(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to repeated power calculations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Checker for combinatorial and factorial overhead
void check_combinatorial_overhead(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to large combinatorial calculations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Checker for loop-intensive calculations
void check_loop_intensive_calculations(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to intensive loop calculations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Insert Conditional Checks into the Original Program

We will integrate the checker functions into the original program. These checks will be placed strategically to avoid adding unnecessary overhead within loops.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
const int M = 998244353;

// Function to compute power modulo M
long long pwr(long long a, long long b, long long m = M) {
  long long ret = 1;
  while (b > 0) {
    if (b & 1) ret = ret * a % m;
    a = a * a % m;
    b >>= 1;
  }
  return ret;
}

// Checker for repeated power calculations
void check_repeated_power_calculations(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to repeated power calculations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Checker for combinatorial and factorial overhead
void check_combinatorial_overhead(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to large combinatorial calculations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Checker for loop-intensive calculations
void check_loop_intensive_calculations(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to intensive loop calculations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cout.tie(nullptr);
  cin.tie(nullptr);
  long long n, k;
  cin >> n >> k;

### Description of Inserted Checks

1. **Repeated Power Calculations Check:**
   - **Purpose:** Detects when `k` is 0, causing repeated power calculations as the loop iterates with maximum `n`.
   - **Placement:** After reading inputs, before any heavy computation begins.

2. **Combinatorial Overhead Check:**
   - **Purpose:** Warns when `n` is very large, causing excessive factorial setup overhead.
   - **Placement:** After reading inputs, ensuring that the setup is not unduly triggered.

3. **Loop-Intensive Calculations Check:**
   - **Purpose:** Identifies when `n` equals `k`, leading to exhaustive looping and computation.
   - **Placement:** Immediately after input validation to preemptively catch heavy-loop scenarios.

These checks are strategically placed to run prior to the main computation, thus avoiding additional overhead during the performance-critical sections of the program.
