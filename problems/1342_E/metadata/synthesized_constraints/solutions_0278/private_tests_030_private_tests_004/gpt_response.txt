### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

Based on the hit count data and the provided code, we can identify the following expensive or inefficient code segments:

1. **Function `qpow`:** The `qpow` function is called extremely frequently in the slow input case, specifically line 26 and its loop starting at line 28. The hit count for some lines reaches over 56 million, indicating this function is being called or recursed into very often. It calculates powers using exponentiation by squaring, which is efficient for a single call, but the sheer number of invocations suggests a computational bottleneck.

2. **Function `NTT`:** The `NTT` function is called a significant number of times (786,429 hits on line 38), and within it, lines 47 to 51, which handle nested loops for the number-theoretic transform, are hit tens of millions of times. This function is likely a major contributor to slower performance due to its complex operations and the nested loop structure.

3. **Function `Solve`:** The `Solve` function features recursive calls (line 82 and line 103), and the recursive nature combined with other operations calls the `NTT` function, compounding the problem. It receives 262,144 hits at certain lines, indicating substantial recursion depth or breadth.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the analysis, we can derive the following performance-characterizing invariants in natural language:

1. **Frequent Power Calculations:**
   - When the problem size involves large power calculations, the repeated invocation of the `qpow` function can lead to significant computational overhead. This is particularly pronounced if the sequence of powers required grows with the size of the input due to the nature of the algorithm.
   - **Invariant:** "If the algorithm frequently calculates high powers for a large number of elements, the power calculation function `qpow` might be called excessively, degrading performance."

2. **Costly Recursive and Transform Operations:**
   - The recursion in `Solve`, combined with frequent calls to `NTT`, suggests that deeply nested recursive structures or high branching factors can lead to a slowdown. This is exacerbated by complex mathematical operations within each recursive step.
   - **Invariant:** "If the algorithm employs deep recursion with frequent complex mathematical transformations, such as NTT, the performance may degrade due to the sheer number of operations in recursive calls."

3. **Large-Scale Transformations:**
   - The use of NTT for polynomial multiplication and convolutions on large data sets can cause a slowdown due to the extensive computation required, especially when handling large arrays or matrices as the input size approaches constraints (e.g., n = 200,000).
   - **Invariant:** "If the input size nears its upper constraint and involves transformations like NTT on large data structures, the performance is likely to degrade due to heavy computation and memory usage."

These invariants help in understanding potential slow paths in the algorithm, particularly under conditions of large input sizes and complex recursive transformations.

### Phase 3: Implement the Natural Language Invariants in C++

Let's implement the performance-characterizing invariants as runtime checks in C++.

1. **Frequent Power Calculations Check:**
   - We will check if there are conditions under which the `qpow` function is likely called excessively. This could be when a large number of power calculations are performed for a specific sequence of numbers.

```cpp
void check_qpow_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: qpow_invariant triggered - excessive power calculations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

2. **Costly Recursive and Transform Operations Check:**
   - We will check if the recursion depth or the number of operations in recursive calls become excessively large. 

```cpp
void check_recursive_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: recursive_invariant triggered - deep recursion or high operations count" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

3. **Large-Scale Transformations Check:**
   - We will check if the transformations, especially involving the NTT on large data, are being frequently applied.

```cpp
void check_ntt_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: ntt_invariant triggered - intense large-scale transformations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrate the Checks into the Original Program

Here is how we can integrate the checks into the original C++ program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
const int mod = 998244353;
const int G = 3;
#pragma GCC target("avx")
#pragma GCC optimize(3)
#pragma GCC optimize("Ofast")
#pragma GCC optimize("inline")
#pragma GCC optimize("unroll-loops")

// Checkers for performance bottlenecks

    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: qpow_invariant triggered - excessive power calculations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_recursive_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: recursive_invariant triggered - deep recursion or high operations count" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_ntt_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: ntt_invariant triggered - intense large-scale transformations" << endl;
        abort();
    }

### Explanation

- **Check for Frequent Power Calculations:** The `check_qpow_invariant` is placed after initialization to detect excessive power calculations. Threshold choice assumes a level of complexity where performance may degrade.
  
- **Check for Recursive and Transform Operations:** The `check_recursive_invariant` is added after calculating `lim`, right before calling `Solve`. This helps detect if the recursion depth or operations may become excessive.

- **Check for Large-Scale Transformations:** The `check_ntt_invariant` is placed following the `Solve` function call, specifically to check if `lim` indicates a large-scale NTT operation is applied.

These checks are designed to detect potential performance issues early without introducing overhead in critical loops.
