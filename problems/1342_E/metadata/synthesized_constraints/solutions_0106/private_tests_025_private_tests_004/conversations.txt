system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

Calculate the number of ways to place n rooks on n × n chessboard so that both following conditions are met:

  * each empty cell is under attack; 
  * exactly k pairs of rooks attack each other. 



An empty cell is under attack if there is at least one rook in the same row or at least one rook in the same column. Two rooks attack each other if they share the same row or column, and there are no other rooks between them. For example, there are only two pairs of rooks that attack each other in the following picture:

<image> One of the ways to place the rooks for n = 3 and k = 2

Two ways to place the rooks are considered different if there exists at least one cell which is empty in one of the ways but contains a rook in another way.

The answer might be large, so print it modulo 998244353.

Input

The only line of the input contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000; 0 ≤ k ≤ (n(n - 1))/(2)).

Output

Print one integer — the number of ways to place the rooks, taken modulo 998244353.

assistant: ### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

Based on the hit counts provided, the following lines of code execute significantly more times in the slow input run compared to the fast input run:

1. **Function `mod` (lines 4-7)**: The function `mod` is called 16,400,028 times in the slow input run but not at all in the fast input run. This suggests that operations involving modulo are heavily used in the slow scenario.

2. **Function `exp` (lines 15-21)**: The recursive function `exp` is called 9,600,018 times in the slow input run but not at all in the fast input run. This indicates that exponentiation is a significant contributor to the computational load.

3. **Loop iterating `c` (lines 48-52)**: The main loop from line 48 to 52 executes 200,002 times in the slow input run, which implies that the operations within this loop, including calls to `C` (lines 26-28) and `exp`, are major contributors to the slow performance.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the analysis, here are some performance-characterizing invariants in natural language:

1. **Heavy use of Modulo Operations:**
   - **Invariant**: When the number of possible combinations (derived from `n - k`) is large, the repeated calculation of modulo operations, especially within a loop, can significantly slow down execution.
   - **Natural language description**: "If the difference between the number of rooks and the number of attacking pairs `n - k` is large, leading to extensive use of modulo operations, the program may slow down considerably."

2. **Expensive Recursive Exponentiation:**
   - **Invariant**: The recursive exponentiation function is particularly costly when used on large values repeatedly within a loop. This is exacerbated when `n` is large, and `k` is small, causing deep and numerous recursive calls.
   - **Natural language description**: "When `n` is large and `k` is small, the frequent recursive computation of powers across large exponents can cause significant slowdowns."

3. **Iterative Combinatorial Calculations:**
   - **Invariant**: Calculations involving combinations (binomial coefficients) within a loop can become computationally expensive when the loop iterates over a large range, especially when `n - k` approaches `n`.
   - **Natural language description**: "The program may slow down when `n - k` is large, requiring extensive combinatorial calculations for each possible configuration of rooks."

These invariants suggest that the performance bottlenecks are not merely due to input size (`n`), but rather the specific relationship between `n` and `k`, especially when `k` is small and large combinatorial operations are involved. This leads to extensive use of recursive exponentiation and repeated modulo operations, which dominate the execution time.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
Calculate the number of ways to place n rooks on n × n chessboard so that both following conditions are met:

  * each empty cell is under attack; 
  * exactly k pairs of rooks attack each other. 



An empty cell is under attack if there is at least one rook in the same row or at least one rook in the same column. Two rooks attack each other if they share the same row or column, and there are no other rooks between them. For example, there are only two pairs of rooks that attack each other in the following picture:

<image> One of the ways to place the rooks for n = 3 and k = 2

Two ways to place the rooks are considered different if there exists at least one cell which is empty in one of the ways but contains a rook in another way.

The answer might be large, so print it modulo 998244353.

Input

The only line of the input contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000; 0 ≤ k ≤ (n(n - 1))/(2)).

Output

Print one integer — the number of ways to place the rooks, taken modulo 998244353.

1. **Heavy use of Modulo Operations:**

```cpp
void check_modulo_operations_invariant(long long c) {
    if (c > 100000) { // Assuming a threshold based on observed behavior
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - extensive modulo operations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

2. **Expensive Recursive Exponentiation:**

```cpp
void check_exponentiation_invariant(long long n, long long k) {
    if (n > 100000 && k < 100) { // Hypothetical condition based on recursive depth and call frequency
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - expensive recursive exponentiation!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

3. **Iterative Combinatorial Calculations:**

```cpp
void check_combination_invariant(long long n, long long c) {
    if (c > 100000) { // Assuming this threshold based on combinatorial calculation intensity
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - extensive combinatorial calculations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrate Checker Code into the Original Program

Below is the final instrumented C++ code with integrated performance checkers:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
const long double PI = acos(-1);
using namespace std;

inline long long mod(long long n, long long m) {
    long long ret = n % m;
    if (ret < 0) ret += m;
    return ret;
}

long long exp(long long a, long long k) {
    if (k == 0) return 1LL;
    if (k == 1) return a;
    long long ax = exp(a, k / 2);
    ax = mod(ax * ax, 998244353);
    if (k % 2) ax = mod(ax * a, 998244353);
    return ax;
}

long long fat[212345], inv[212345];

long long finv(long long n) {
    return exp(n, 998244353 - 2);
}

long long C(long long n, long long k) {
    long long num = fat[n];
    long long den = mod(inv[k] * inv[n - k], 998244353);
    return mod(num * den, 998244353);
}

void check_modulo_operations_invariant(long long c) {
    if (c > 100000) { 
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - extensive modulo operations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_exponentiation_invariant(long long n, long long k) {
    if (n > 100000 && k < 100) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - expensive recursive exponentiation!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_combination_invariant(long long n, long long c) {
    if (c > 100000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - extensive combinatorial calculations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int32_t main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(0);
    cout.tie(0);

    fat[0] = 1;
    inv[0] = 1;
    long long n, k;
    cin >> n >> k;

    if (k > n - 1) {
        cout << 0 << '\n';
        return 0;
    }

    for (long long i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        fat[i] = mod(fat[i - 1] * i, 998244353);
        inv[i] = finv(fat[i]);
    }

    long long c = n - k;

    // Insert checkers before potentially costly operations
    check_modulo_operations_invariant(c);
    check_exponentiation_invariant(n, k);
    check_combination_invariant(n, c);

    long long ans = 0;
    for (long long i = 0; i <= c; i++) {
        if (i % 2) {
            ans = mod(ans - C(c, i) * exp(c - i, n), 998244353);
        } else {
            ans = mod(ans + C(c, i) * exp(c - i, n), 998244353);
        }
    }

    ans = mod(ans * C(n, c), 998244353);
    if (k > 0) ans = mod(ans * 2LL, 998244353);

    cout << ans << '\n';
}
```

### Comments

- **Placement**: The checks are strategically placed after input reading and before the main loops and operations that could lead to performance degradation. This ensures they do not introduce unnecessary overhead in tight loops.
- **Thresholds**: The thresholds used in the checkers are hypothetical and should ideally be adjusted based on empirical profiling of the code with different inputs.
- **Utility**: These checks would be useful for a fuzzer to detect when performance starts to degrade noticeably due to specific input conditions.
