### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

Based on the hit counts provided, the following lines of code execute significantly more times in the slow input run compared to the fast input run:

1. **Function `mod` (lines 4-7)**: The function `mod` is called 16,400,028 times in the slow input run but not at all in the fast input run. This suggests that operations involving modulo are heavily used in the slow scenario.

2. **Function `exp` (lines 15-21)**: The recursive function `exp` is called 9,600,018 times in the slow input run but not at all in the fast input run. This indicates that exponentiation is a significant contributor to the computational load.

3. **Loop iterating `c` (lines 48-52)**: The main loop from line 48 to 52 executes 200,002 times in the slow input run, which implies that the operations within this loop, including calls to `C` (lines 26-28) and `exp`, are major contributors to the slow performance.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the analysis, here are some performance-characterizing invariants in natural language:

1. **Heavy use of Modulo Operations:**
   - **Invariant**: When the number of possible combinations (derived from `n - k`) is large, the repeated calculation of modulo operations, especially within a loop, can significantly slow down execution.
   - **Natural language description**: "If the difference between the number of rooks and the number of attacking pairs `n - k` is large, leading to extensive use of modulo operations, the program may slow down considerably."

2. **Expensive Recursive Exponentiation:**
   - **Invariant**: The recursive exponentiation function is particularly costly when used on large values repeatedly within a loop. This is exacerbated when `n` is large, and `k` is small, causing deep and numerous recursive calls.
   - **Natural language description**: "When `n` is large and `k` is small, the frequent recursive computation of powers across large exponents can cause significant slowdowns."

3. **Iterative Combinatorial Calculations:**
   - **Invariant**: Calculations involving combinations (binomial coefficients) within a loop can become computationally expensive when the loop iterates over a large range, especially when `n - k` approaches `n`.
   - **Natural language description**: "The program may slow down when `n - k` is large, requiring extensive combinatorial calculations for each possible configuration of rooks."

These invariants suggest that the performance bottlenecks are not merely due to input size (`n`), but rather the specific relationship between `n` and `k`, especially when `k` is small and large combinatorial operations are involved. This leads to extensive use of recursive exponentiation and repeated modulo operations, which dominate the execution time.

=== Checker Response ===
### Phase 3: Implement Natural Language Invariants as Checker Code

Below are the C++ code snippets implementing the performance-characterizing invariants derived earlier:

1. **Heavy use of Modulo Operations:**

```cpp
void check_modulo_operations_invariant(long long c) {
    if (c > 100000) { // Assuming a threshold based on observed behavior
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - extensive modulo operations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

2. **Expensive Recursive Exponentiation:**

```cpp
void check_exponentiation_invariant(long long n, long long k) {
    if (n > 100000 && k < 100) { // Hypothetical condition based on recursive depth and call frequency
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - expensive recursive exponentiation!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

3. **Iterative Combinatorial Calculations:**

```cpp
void check_combination_invariant(long long n, long long c) {
    if (c > 100000) { // Assuming this threshold based on combinatorial calculation intensity
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - extensive combinatorial calculations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrate Checker Code into the Original Program

Below is the final instrumented C++ code with integrated performance checkers:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
const long double PI = acos(-1);
using namespace std;

inline long long mod(long long n, long long m) {
    long long ret = n % m;
    if (ret < 0) ret += m;
    return ret;
}

long long exp(long long a, long long k) {
    if (k == 0) return 1LL;
    if (k == 1) return a;
    long long ax = exp(a, k / 2);
    ax = mod(ax * ax, 998244353);
    if (k % 2) ax = mod(ax * a, 998244353);
    return ax;
}

long long fat[212345], inv[212345];

long long finv(long long n) {
    return exp(n, 998244353 - 2);
}

long long C(long long n, long long k) {
    long long num = fat[n];
    long long den = mod(inv[k] * inv[n - k], 998244353);
    return mod(num * den, 998244353);
}

void check_modulo_operations_invariant(long long c) {
    if (c > 100000) { 
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - extensive modulo operations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_exponentiation_invariant(long long n, long long k) {
    if (n > 100000 && k < 100) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - expensive recursive exponentiation!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_combination_invariant(long long n, long long c) {
    if (c > 100000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - extensive combinatorial calculations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int32_t main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(0);
    cout.tie(0);

    fat[0] = 1;
    inv[0] = 1;
    long long n, k;
    cin >> n >> k;

    if (k > n - 1) {
        cout << 0 << '\n';
        return 0;
    }

    for (long long i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        fat[i] = mod(fat[i - 1] * i, 998244353);
        inv[i] = finv(fat[i]);
    }

    long long c = n - k;

    // Insert checkers before potentially costly operations
    check_modulo_operations_invariant(c);
    check_exponentiation_invariant(n, k);
    check_combination_invariant(n, c);

    long long ans = 0;
    for (long long i = 0; i <= c; i++) {
        if (i % 2) {
            ans = mod(ans - C(c, i) * exp(c - i, n), 998244353);
        } else {
            ans = mod(ans + C(c, i) * exp(c - i, n), 998244353);
        }
    }

    ans = mod(ans * C(n, c), 998244353);
    if (k > 0) ans = mod(ans * 2LL, 998244353);

    cout << ans << '\n';
}
```

### Comments

- **Placement**: The checks are strategically placed after input reading and before the main loops and operations that could lead to performance degradation. This ensures they do not introduce unnecessary overhead in tight loops.
- **Thresholds**: The thresholds used in the checkers are hypothetical and should ideally be adjusted based on empirical profiling of the code with different inputs.
- **Utility**: These checks would be useful for a fuzzer to detect when performance starts to degrade noticeably due to specific input conditions.
