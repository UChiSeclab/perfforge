system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

The only difference between easy and hard versions is on constraints. In this version constraints are lower. You can make hacks only if all versions of the problem are solved.

Koa the Koala is at the beach!

The beach consists (from left to right) of a shore, n+1 meters of sea and an island at n+1 meters from the shore.

She measured the depth of the sea at 1, 2, ..., n meters from the shore and saved them in array d. d_i denotes the depth of the sea at i meters from the shore for 1 ≤ i ≤ n.

Like any beach this one has tide, the intensity of the tide is measured by parameter k and affects all depths from the beginning at time t=0 in the following way:

  * For a total of k seconds, each second, tide increases all depths by 1.

  * Then, for a total of k seconds, each second, tide decreases all depths by 1.

  * This process repeats again and again (ie. depths increase for k seconds then decrease for k seconds and so on ...).

Formally, let's define 0-indexed array p = [0, 1, 2, …, k - 2, k - 1, k, k - 1, k - 2, …, 2, 1] of length 2k. At time t (0 ≤ t) depth at i meters from the shore equals d_i + p[t mod 2k] (t mod 2k denotes the remainder of the division of t by 2k). Note that the changes occur instantaneously after each second, see the notes for better understanding. 




At time t=0 Koa is standing at the shore and wants to get to the island. Suppose that at some time t (0 ≤ t) she is at x (0 ≤ x ≤ n) meters from the shore:

  * In one second Koa can swim 1 meter further from the shore (x changes to x+1) or not swim at all (x stays the same), in both cases t changes to t+1.

  * As Koa is a bad swimmer, the depth of the sea at the point where she is can't exceed l at integer points of time (or she will drown). More formally, if Koa is at x (1 ≤ x ≤ n) meters from the shore at the moment t (for some integer t≥ 0), the depth of the sea at this point — d_x + p[t mod 2k] — can't exceed l. In other words, d_x + p[t mod 2k] ≤ l must hold always.

  * Once Koa reaches the island at n+1 meters from the shore, she stops and can rest.

Note that while Koa swims tide doesn't have effect on her (ie. she can't drown while swimming). Note that Koa can choose to stay on the shore for as long as she needs and neither the shore or the island are affected by the tide (they are solid ground and she won't drown there). 




Koa wants to know whether she can go from the shore to the island. Help her!

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) — the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n, k and l (1 ≤ n ≤ 100; 1 ≤ k ≤ 100; 1 ≤ l ≤ 100) — the number of meters of sea Koa measured and parameters k and l.

The second line of each test case contains n integers d_1, d_2, …, d_n (0 ≤ d_i ≤ 100) — the depths of each meter of sea Koa measured.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 100.

Output

For each test case:

Print Yes if Koa can get from the shore to the island, and No otherwise.

You may print each letter in any case (upper or lower).

Output

No

Note

In the following s denotes the shore, i denotes the island, x denotes distance from Koa to the shore, the underline denotes the position of Koa, and values in the array below denote current depths, affected by tide, at 1, 2, ..., n meters from the shore.

In test case 1 we have n = 2, k = 1, l = 1, p = [ 0, 1 ].

Koa wants to go from shore (at x = 0) to the island (at x = 3). Let's describe a possible solution:

  * Initially at t = 0 the beach looks like this: [\underline{s}, 1, 0, i]. 
  * At t = 0 if Koa would decide to swim to x = 1, beach would look like: [s, \underline{2}, 1, i] at t = 1, since 2 > 1 she would drown. So Koa waits 1 second instead and beach looks like [\underline{s}, 2, 1, i] at t = 1. 
  * At t = 1 Koa swims to x = 1, beach looks like [s, \underline{1}, 0, i] at t = 2. Koa doesn't drown because 1 ≤ 1. 
  * At t = 2 Koa swims to x = 2, beach looks like [s, 2, \underline{1}, i] at t = 3. Koa doesn't drown because 1 ≤ 1. 
  * At t = 3 Koa swims to x = 3, beach looks like [s, 1, 0, \underline{i}] at t = 4. 
  * At t = 4 Koa is at x = 3 and she made it! 



We can show that in test case 2 Koa can't get to the island.

assistant: ### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

Upon analyzing the hit counts for both the slow and fast inputs, we notice the following:

1. **Line 16** (`for (int j = 1; j <= 2 * k * n; j++)`): This line is executed a substantial number of times (159,035 times for both inputs). This nested loop iterates over a range tied to `2 * k * n`, making it very sensitive to the values of `k` and `n`.

2. **Lines 18-22**: These lines involve a computation and a conditional check for each iteration of the inner loop. The operations in these lines are executed 130,271 times for the slow input but significantly fewer times (3,739 times) for the fast input. This suggests that these lines are critical in differentiating the performance between the slow and fast inputs.

3. **Condition Impact**: The condition `if (h <= l)` in line 22 seems to be frequently true under the slow input, which implies that the loop continues to iterate over a large range without early exits or skips. 

Overall, the expensive segment of the code revolves around this nested loop structure and the computation of `h`, which is influenced by the parameters `k`, `a[i]`, and `l`.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the above analysis, we can derive the following performance-characterizing invariants:

1. **High Tide-Limit Interaction**:
   - Natural language description: "When the sum of the sea depth at any point `a[i]` and the maximum possible tide effect `k` frequently results in values less than or equal to `l`, the inner loop may repeatedly process each depth, resulting in significant slowdowns."
   - Threshold suggestion: This scenario is more likely when `l` is close to or greater than the maximum possible tide-affected depth (`a[i] + k`), which causes fewer immediate breaks in the loop.

2. **High Iteration Count**:
   - Natural language description: "If the parameter `k` is large relative to `n`, the loop iterations become extensive, which can compound inefficiencies, especially if many depths need repeated checking."
   - Threshold suggestion: Given `n <= 100`, scenarios where `k` approaches or is equal to 100 can exacerbate performance issues, as they increase the potential iteration count in the nested loop.

3. **Depth Distribution and Tide Synchrony**:
   - Natural language description: "When the sequence of depths `a[]` and the oscillation pattern of the tide `p[]` are synchronized in such a way that many depths are frequently within the permissible range defined by `l`, excessive checks and minimal progress occur within the loop."
   - Threshold suggestion: Avoid configurations where the average of `a[i] + max(p[])` often falls below or close to `l`, leading to prolonged processing.

These invariants help in understanding the conditions under which the existing C program might slow down significantly. They are broadly applicable given the input constraints and should aid in identifying similar slow-input scenarios in the future.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
The only difference between easy and hard versions is on constraints. In this version constraints are lower. You can make hacks only if all versions of the problem are solved.

Koa the Koala is at the beach!

The beach consists (from left to right) of a shore, n+1 meters of sea and an island at n+1 meters from the shore.

She measured the depth of the sea at 1, 2, ..., n meters from the shore and saved them in array d. d_i denotes the depth of the sea at i meters from the shore for 1 ≤ i ≤ n.

Like any beach this one has tide, the intensity of the tide is measured by parameter k and affects all depths from the beginning at time t=0 in the following way:

  * For a total of k seconds, each second, tide increases all depths by 1.

  * Then, for a total of k seconds, each second, tide decreases all depths by 1.

  * This process repeats again and again (ie. depths increase for k seconds then decrease for k seconds and so on ...).

Formally, let's define 0-indexed array p = [0, 1, 2, …, k - 2, k - 1, k, k - 1, k - 2, …, 2, 1] of length 2k. At time t (0 ≤ t) depth at i meters from the shore equals d_i + p[t mod 2k] (t mod 2k denotes the remainder of the division of t by 2k). Note that the changes occur instantaneously after each second, see the notes for better understanding. 




At time t=0 Koa is standing at the shore and wants to get to the island. Suppose that at some time t (0 ≤ t) she is at x (0 ≤ x ≤ n) meters from the shore:

  * In one second Koa can swim 1 meter further from the shore (x changes to x+1) or not swim at all (x stays the same), in both cases t changes to t+1.

  * As Koa is a bad swimmer, the depth of the sea at the point where she is can't exceed l at integer points of time (or she will drown). More formally, if Koa is at x (1 ≤ x ≤ n) meters from the shore at the moment t (for some integer t≥ 0), the depth of the sea at this point — d_x + p[t mod 2k] — can't exceed l. In other words, d_x + p[t mod 2k] ≤ l must hold always.

  * Once Koa reaches the island at n+1 meters from the shore, she stops and can rest.

Note that while Koa swims tide doesn't have effect on her (ie. she can't drown while swimming). Note that Koa can choose to stay on the shore for as long as she needs and neither the shore or the island are affected by the tide (they are solid ground and she won't drown there). 




Koa wants to know whether she can go from the shore to the island. Help her!

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) — the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n, k and l (1 ≤ n ≤ 100; 1 ≤ k ≤ 100; 1 ≤ l ≤ 100) — the number of meters of sea Koa measured and parameters k and l.

The second line of each test case contains n integers d_1, d_2, …, d_n (0 ≤ d_i ≤ 100) — the depths of each meter of sea Koa measured.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 100.

Output

For each test case:

Print Yes if Koa can get from the shore to the island, and No otherwise.

You may print each letter in any case (upper or lower).

Note

In the following s denotes the shore, i denotes the island, x denotes distance from Koa to the shore, the underline denotes the position of Koa, and values in the array below denote current depths, affected by tide, at 1, 2, ..., n meters from the shore.

In test case 1 we have n = 2, k = 1, l = 1, p = [ 0, 1 ].

Koa wants to go from shore (at x = 0) to the island (at x = 3). Let's describe a possible solution:

  * Initially at t = 0 the beach looks like this: [\underline{s}, 1, 0, i]. 
  * At t = 0 if Koa would decide to swim to x = 1, beach would look like: [s, \underline{2}, 1, i] at t = 1, since 2 > 1 she would drown. So Koa waits 1 second instead and beach looks like [\underline{s}, 2, 1, i] at t = 1. 
  * At t = 1 Koa swims to x = 1, beach looks like [s, \underline{1}, 0, i] at t = 2. Koa doesn't drown because 1 ≤ 1. 
  * At t = 2 Koa swims to x = 2, beach looks like [s, 2, \underline{1}, i] at t = 3. Koa doesn't drown because 1 ≤ 1. 
  * At t = 3 Koa swims to x = 3, beach looks like [s, 1, 0, \underline{i}] at t = 4. 
  * At t = 4 Koa is at x = 3 and she made it! 



We can show that in test case 2 Koa can't get to the island.

assistant: ### Phase 3: Implement Performance-Characterizing Invariants in C++

Below are the C++ snippets implementing the performance-characterizing invariants derived earlier:

#### Invariant 1: High Tide-Limit Interaction

```cpp
void check_tide_limit_interaction(int a[], int n, int k, int l) {
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        if (a[i] + k <= l) {
            cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - High Tide-Limit Interaction!" << endl;
            abort();
        }
    }
}
```

#### Invariant 2: High Iteration Count

```cpp
void check_iteration_count(int n, int k) {
    if (k >= 100) { // As k approaching its maximum constraint impacts performance
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - High Iteration Count!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

#### Invariant 3: Depth Distribution and Tide Synchrony

```cpp
void check_depth_tide_synchrony(int a[], int n, int k, int l) {
    int max_tide = k; // Max value of tide effect on depth
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        int average_depth = (a[i] + max_tide) / 2;
        if (average_depth <= l) {
            cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - Depth Distribution and Tide Synchrony!" << endl;
            abort();
        }
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrate Checker Code with Original Program

Here is the final C++ program with integrated performance-checking code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int inf = 0x3f3f3f3f;
const int N = 2e5 + 7;
int n, k, l, h;
int dp[107][N], a[N];

// Checkers for performance bottlenecks
void check_tide_limit_interaction(int a[], int n, int k, int l) {
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        if (a[i] + k <= l) {
            cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - High Tide-Limit Interaction!" << endl;
            abort();
        }
    }
}

void check_iteration_count(int n, int k) {
    if (k >= 100) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - High Iteration Count!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_depth_tide_synchrony(int a[], int n, int k, int l) {
    int max_tide = k;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        int average_depth = (a[i] + max_tide) / 2;
        if (average_depth <= l) {
            cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - Depth Distribution and Tide Synchrony!" << endl;
            abort();
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    int t;
    cin >> t;
    while (t--) {
        memset(dp, -1, sizeof(dp));
        scanf("%d%d%d", &n, &k, &l);
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) scanf("%d", &a[i]);
        
        // Integrate performance checkers
        check_tide_limit_interaction(a, n, k, l);
        check_iteration_count(n, k);
        check_depth_tide_synchrony(a, n, k, l);

        for (int i = 0; i <= 2 * k * n; i++) dp[0][i] = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= 2 * k * n; j++) {
                if (dp[i - 1][j - 1] == -1 && dp[i][j - 1] == -1) continue;
                if (j % (2 * k) < k)
                    h = a[i] + j % k;
                else
                    h = a[i] + k - (j % k);
                if (h <= l) dp[i][j] = 0;
            }
        }
        int fl = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i <= 10000; i++) {
            if (dp[n][i] == 0) fl = 1;
        }
        if (fl == 1)
            printf("YES\n");
        else
            printf("NO\n");
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of Integration

- **Invariant 1**: The `check_tide_limit_interaction` function is called after reading the depths `a[]` to ensure the maximum tide effect does not frequently fall below the limit `l`.

- **Invariant 2**: The `check_iteration_count` function is called immediately after reading `n` and `k` to prevent scenarios where `k` is large, potentially causing performance issues due to extensive loop iterations.

- **Invariant 3**: The `check_depth_tide_synchrony` function checks the relationship between average depths and the tide, ensuring they do not frequently stay within permissible ranges, which could lead to excessive loop nesting.
