=== Invariants Response ===
To analyze the performance bottlenecks in the provided C code, we will follow the structured tasks as outlined in the problem description.

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Comparison of Hit Counts**:
   - The function `func(int timee, int pos)` is called significantly more times in the slow input (`1,116,486` hits) compared to the fast input (`30,003` hits). This suggests that the recursion depth or the number of states being explored is much larger for the slow input.
   - Within this function, the most critical lines are:
     - Line 8 (`if (timee == timeLim + 1)`) which is hit consistently indicating a potential early termination in some cases.
     - Line 11 (`if (dp[timee][pos] != -1)`) showing high hits due to memoization checks.
     - Line 12 (`return dp[timee][pos]`) indicating frequent retrieval from the memoization table.
     - Line 16 and Line 22, which represent recursive calls to `func` for potential swimming decisions (stay or move forward).
   
2. **Interaction with Data Structures**:
   - The high hit count for `func` suggests repeated evaluations or overlapping subproblems that might not be resolved efficiently, even with memoization.
   - The `dp` array usage indicates dynamic programming, but the slow input encounters more complex or numerous states requiring evaluation.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the analysis, the following performance-characterizing invariants explain under what conditions the code slows down:

1. **Depth Constraint Interaction**:
   - **Invariant**: "When the maximum depth `l` is only slightly higher than the depths `d[i]` adjusted by tide array `p`, the number of valid paths Koa can explore is limited, leading to a higher computation cost as the recursive function `func` explores numerous invalid states before determining feasibility."
   - **Implication**: This invariant suggests that the program slows down when `l` is just marginally greater than the depths adjusted by the tide, resulting in a larger search space due to constraints being frequently close to being violated.

2. **Tide Periodicity Impact**:
   - **Invariant**: "If the period `2k` of the tide is long relative to the number of positions `n`, or if `k` results in frequent maximal depth scenarios, Koa has fewer optimal times to swim, increasing exploration time as `func` tries many time and position combinations."
   - **Implication**: When the tide period aligns in a way that frequently prevents valid swimming times, the recursion tree becomes deeper and more complex, slowing down the decision-making process.

3. **State Space Complexity**:
   - **Invariant**: "If the state space defined by `(timee, pos)` combinations is large without being effectively pruned due to close depth constraints, the recursive exploration by `func` becomes computationally expensive."
   - **Implication**: The memoization helps reduce recalculations, but when too many states are near the constraint limit, the recursion must explore more paths, leading to inefficiency.

These invariants are broad enough to catch potential future slow scenarios while remaining realistic given the constraints (`n <= 100`, `k <= 100`, `l <= 100`). They focus on the relationship between tide dynamics, depth constraints, and state space complexity, which are critical to understanding performance degradation in the problem context.

=== Checker Response ===
Let's begin with Phase 3, where we translate the performance-characterizing invariants into C++ checker code. Then, we'll proceed to Phase 4, where we integrate these checks into the original C++ program.

### Phase 3: Implement the Natural Language Invariants in C++

Below are the C++ snippets for the performance-characterizing invariants:

1. **Depth Constraint Interaction**:
   - This invariant checks if the depth constraints are frequently close to being violated.
```cpp
void check_depth_constraint_invariant(int l, int depth, int tideEffect) {
    if (depth + tideEffect > l - 1) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - depth constraint interaction" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

2. **Tide Periodicity Impact**:
   - This invariant checks if the tide period results in frequent maximal depth scenarios.
```cpp
void check_tide_periodicity_invariant(int k, int n) {
    if (2 * k < n) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - tide periodicity impact" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

3. **State Space Complexity**:
   - This invariant checks the complexity of the state space being explored.
```cpp
void check_state_space_complexity_invariant(int timee, int pos, int timeLim) {
    if (timee > timeLim - 1000) { // Arbitrary threshold for complexity
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - state space complexity" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrate the Checkers into the C++ Program

Below is the original C++ code with the integrated performance checkers:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int dp[100005][209], n, k, l, depth[609], timeLim, p[100005];

// Integrate depth constraint interaction checker
void check_depth_constraint_invariant(int l, int depth, int tideEffect) {
    if (depth + tideEffect > l - 1) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - depth constraint interaction" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Integrate tide periodicity impact checker
void check_tide_periodicity_invariant(int k, int n) {
    if (2 * k < n) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - tide periodicity impact" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Integrate state space complexity checker
void check_state_space_complexity_invariant(int timee, int pos, int timeLim) {
    if (timee > timeLim - 1000) { // Arbitrary threshold for complexity
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - state space complexity" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int func(int timee, int pos) {
    // Check state space complexity
    check_state_space_complexity_invariant(timee, pos, timeLim);

    if (pos == n + 1) {
        return 1;
    }
    if (timee == timeLim + 1) {
        return 0;
    }
    if (dp[timee][pos] != -1) {
        return dp[timee][pos];
    }
    int ans = 0;
    int newDep = depth[pos] + p[(timee + 1) % (2 * k)];
    
    // Check depth constraints
    check_depth_constraint_invariant(l, depth[pos], p[(timee + 1) % (2 * k)]);

    if (newDep <= l || pos == 0) ans = func(timee + 1, pos);
    if (pos + 1 == n + 1) {
        ans = max(ans, func(timee + 1, pos + 1));
    } else {
        int newDepth = depth[pos + 1] + p[(timee + 1) % (2 * k)];
        if (newDepth <= l) {
            ans = max(ans, func(timee + 1, pos + 1));
        }
    }
    return dp[timee][pos] = ans;
}

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);
    int i, j, line;
    cin >> line;
    while (line--) {
        cin >> n >> k >> l;
        timeLim = 10000;

        // Check tide periodicity impact
        check_tide_periodicity_invariant(k, n);

        for (i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            cin >> depth[i];
        }
        for (i = 0; i <= timeLim; i++) {
            for (j = 0; j <= n + 1; j++) {
                dp[i][j] = -1;
            }
        }
        p[0] = 0;
        int cur = 1;
        for (i = 1; i <= k; i++) {
            p[cur] = i;
            cur++;
        }
        for (i = k - 1; i > 0; i--) {
            p[cur] = i;
            cur++;
        }
        int ans = func(0, 0);
        if (ans == 1) {
            cout << "Yes" << endl;
        } else {
            cout << "No" << endl;
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation of the Integrated Checkers

- **Depth Constraint Interaction**: This check is placed inside the recursive function `func` where the depth at a given position and time is calculated.
- **Tide Periodicity Impact**: This check is placed right after reading input parameters for each test case to ensure the periodicity isn't negatively impacting performance.
- **State Space Complexity**: This check is placed at the beginning of the recursive function `func` to assess the complexity of recursion at runtime.

These checks help identify potential bottlenecks during execution and provide valuable feedback if the program is about to enter a slow path.
