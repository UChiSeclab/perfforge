=== Invariants Response ===
To determine why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive performance-characterizing invariants, let's analyze the code behavior and hit count information.

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Line-Level Hit Count Analysis:**
   - The loop at line 9 is executed 10,000,001 times for the slow input but only 6 times for the fast input. This suggests the loop is the source of the slowdown.
   - Within the loop, lines 14 and 19 are executed 9,999,999 and 4,999,999 times respectively for the slow input, whereas they are executed significantly less for the fast input.

2. **Understanding Code Logic:**
   - The loop iterates up to 10,000,000. For each iteration, it checks specific conditions using modulo operations.
   - The variables `pa`, `pb`, and `pc` are used to store initial modulo values for `a`, `b`, and `c` respectively, and subsequent iterations check if these values change.
   - If any of these values change and have not been set initially, they are updated.

3. **Interaction with Input Data:**
   - The slow input `(2, 2, 5)` results in many iterations because both `a` and `b` are equal, leading to repeated conditions and checks that prolong the loop's execution.
   - The fast input `(2, 5, 5)` behaves differently as `a`, `b`, and `c` have distinct values after the initial swaps, quickly satisfying the conditions and exiting the loop.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the analysis, we can infer conditions that lead to slow execution:

1. **Natural Language Invariant #1:**
   - "If the two smallest interval values are equal, the loop may iterate excessively as there is no change in modulo conditions, leading to prolonged execution times."

2. **Natural Language Invariant #2:**
   - "When at least two of the garland intervals are equal, the program may not effectively find a suitable switching time, causing the loop to run its full length, thereby slowing down the performance."

3. **Natural Language Invariant #3:**
   - "If the modulo conditions for determining initial states of garlands do not change quickly due to overlapping interval values, the computation may enter a slow path due to prolonged loop execution."

These invariants emphasize the importance of distinct interval values for efficient execution, as repeated values can trap the program in a lengthy iteration without reaching a conclusion quickly. These conditions can be used to guide further optimizations or checks to prevent slow path executions in similar scenarios.

### Phase 3: Implement Natural Language Invariants in C++

Let's implement the performance-characterizing invariants derived earlier as runtime checks in C++:

1. **Invariant #1:**
   - "If the two smallest interval values are equal, the loop may iterate excessively as there is no change in modulo conditions, leading to prolonged execution times."

   ```cpp
   void check_equal_intervals_invariant(long long a, long long b) {
       if (a == b) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - equal interval values." << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Invariant #2:**
   - "When at least two of the garland intervals are equal, the program may not effectively find a suitable switching time, causing the loop to run its full length, thereby slowing down the performance."

   ```cpp
   void check_any_equal_intervals_invariant(long long a, long long b, long long c) {
       if (a == b || b == c || a == c) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - at least two equal intervals." << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Invariant #3:**
   - "If the modulo conditions for determining initial states of garlands do not change quickly due to overlapping interval values, the computation may enter a slow path due to prolonged loop execution."

   ```cpp
   void check_slow_path_conditions(long long a, long long b, long long c) {
       // Checking for a potential slow path due to overlapping values
       if ((a % b == 0) || (b % c == 0) || (a % c == 0)) {
           cerr << "Warning: Slow path condition triggered - overlapping interval values causing slow execution." << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Integrate Checkers into the Original Program

Now, we will integrate these checkers into the provided C++ program. We should place these checks after reading inputs and before any heavy computation starts:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

long long a, b, c, pa = -1, pb = -1, pc = -1;

void check_equal_intervals_invariant(long long a, long long b) {
    if (a == b) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - equal interval values." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_any_equal_intervals_invariant(long long a, long long b, long long c) {
    if (a == b || b == c || a == c) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - at least two equal intervals." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_slow_path_conditions(long long a, long long b, long long c) {
    if ((a % b == 0) || (b % c == 0) || (a % c == 0)) {
        cerr << "Warning: Slow path condition triggered - overlapping interval values causing slow execution." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    scanf("%lld%lld%lld", &a, &b, &c);

    // Perform checks to detect potential performance bottlenecks
    check_equal_intervals_invariant(a, b);
    check_any_equal_intervals_invariant(a, b, c);
    check_slow_path_conditions(a, b, c);

    if (a > b) swap(a, b);
    if (b > c) swap(b, c);
    if (a > b) swap(a, b);

    for (int i = 1; i <= 10000000; i++) {
        if (pa == -1) {
            pa = i % a;
            continue;
        }
        if (i % a != pa) {
            if (pb == -1) {
                pb = i % b;
                continue;
            }
            if (i % b != pb) {
                if (pc == -1) {
                    pc = i % c;
                    continue;
                }
                if (i % c != pc) {
                    puts("NO");
                    return 0;
                }
            }
        }
    }
    puts("YES");
}
```

### Explanation

- **Check Placement:** The checks are placed immediately after the input reading to avoid unnecessary computation if a bottleneck condition is detected.
- **Invariant Implementation:** Each invariant check is implemented to terminate the program with a clear warning if a potential slow path condition is detected, helping in debugging and optimization.
- **Avoiding Overhead:** These checks are placed outside the main computational loop to avoid additional runtime overhead.
