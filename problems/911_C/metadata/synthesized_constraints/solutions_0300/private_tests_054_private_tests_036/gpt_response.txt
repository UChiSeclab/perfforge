### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Comparison of Line-Level Hit Counts:**

   - The `check` function at line 5 shows extremely high hit counts in the slow input compared to the fast input (1,040,604 vs. 106).
   - Lines 7 and 8 inside the `check` function also have significantly higher hit counts for the slow input (3,619,808 vs. 1,252).
   - The nested loop starting at line 12 and the line 13 incrementing `lit[y]` show drastically more hits in the slow input (331,278,056 vs. 33,992).

2. **Pinpointing Inefficient Code Segments:**

   - **Recursive Function `check`:** The high number of recursive calls in the slow case suggests a deep or wide recursion tree, likely due to excessive branching or repeated calculations.
   - **Nested loops at line 13 and line 15:** These loops contribute heavily to the hit count, indicating that operations inside these loops are performed a large number of times.

3. **Interaction with Data Structures:**

   - The use of the `lit` array indicates repeated updates and checks over a large range, especially with nested loops iterating over this array.
   - The constraints (like `n <= 100` and `k[i] <= 1500`) suggest that the inefficiency arises not from the array size itself but from the way it's accessed repeatedly in nested or recursive structures.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **Recursive Depth and Branching:**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "If the recursion explores a deep or wide search space, as indicated by a high number of recursive calls or checks, the computation time may increase significantly. This is often triggered when the periodic intervals of the garlands are such that they require checking many combinations or states."
   
2. **Nested Loop Operations:**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "If nested loops perform operations on a shared data structure (like the `lit` array) across a large range or with high frequency, especially when combined with recursive calls, the program may slow down due to excessive computation or repeated state changes."

3. **Interaction of Periodic Intervals:**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "When the periodic intervals (`k1`, `k2`, `k3`) of the garlands lead to complex overlap or require many adjustments (increment/decrement operations), this can result in increased computational overhead due to the need for exhaustive checking of all possible switch-on times."

These invariants focus on the conditions under which the program is likely to experience slowdowns, emphasizing recursive depth, nested loop iterations, and the interaction between periodic intervals and state changes. The thresholds for these conditions are abstracted from numeric values and instead focus on patterns and structural complexities in the input and computation.

### Phase 3: Implement the Natural Language Invariants in C++

Below are the C++ code snippets to implement the performance-characterizing invariants inferred previously. Each snippet checks a specific condition at runtime, guarding against potential performance bottlenecks.

1. **Recursive Depth and Branching:**

    ```cpp
    void check_recursion_invariant(int depth, int maxDepth) {
        if (depth > maxDepth) {
            cerr << "Warning: Recursion depth invariant triggered - excessive recursion depth" << endl;
            abort();
        }
    }
    ```

2. **Nested Loop Operations:**

    ```cpp
    void check_loop_invariant(int iterations, int threshold) {
        if (iterations > threshold) {
            cerr << "Warning: Loop invariant triggered - excessive iterations in nested loops" << endl;
            abort();
        }
    }
    ```

### Phase 4: Integrate the Checker Code into the Original Program

Below is the original program with the integrated runtime checks to detect potential performance bottlenecks.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

const int M = 100, N = 1000;
int k[3], kmax, lit[N + 1];

// Recursive depth check
void check_recursion_invariant(int depth, int maxDepth) {
    if (depth > maxDepth) {
        cerr << "Warning: Recursion depth invariant triggered - excessive recursion depth" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Nested loop iteration check
void check_loop_invariant(int iterations, int threshold) {
    if (iterations > threshold) {
        cerr << "Warning: Loop invariant triggered - excessive iterations in nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

bool check(int n = 0, int xmax = 0, int depth = 0) {
    check_recursion_invariant(depth, 100); // Check for excessive recursion depth
    
    if (n == 3) {
        for (int y = xmax; y <= N; y++)
            if (!lit[y]) return false;
        return true;
    }

    int p = n + 1, q = k[n];
    int loopIterations = 0;
    
    for (int x = 0; x <= M; x++) {
        check_loop_invariant(++loopIterations, 1000); // Check for excessive loop iterations
        
        for (int y = x; y <= N; y += q) lit[y]++;
        if (check(p, max(x, xmax), depth + 1)) return true;
        for (int y = x; y <= N; y += q) lit[y]--;
    }
    return false;
}

int main() {
    for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) cin >> k[i];
    sort(k, k + 3), kmax = k[2];
    
    if (check())
        cout << "YES";
    else
        cout << "NO";
}
```

### Explanation

- **Recursion Depth Check:** Before every recursive call in `check`, the program verifies that the recursion depth does not exceed a predefined threshold (100 in this case). This prevents excessive recursion that can lead to slowdowns.
  
- **Nested Loop Iteration Check:** Within the nested loop, a counter tracks the number of iterations, and the program ensures it remains below a certain threshold (1000 here). This avoids excessive computations inside nested loops, which can cause performance issues.

These checks are strategically placed to detect and prevent situations that could lead to significant performance degradation, without adding unnecessary overhead in the programâ€™s main logic flow.
