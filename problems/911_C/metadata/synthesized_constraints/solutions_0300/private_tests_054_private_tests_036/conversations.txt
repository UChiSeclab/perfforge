system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

Mishka is decorating the Christmas tree. He has got three garlands, and all of them will be put on the tree. After that Mishka will switch these garlands on.

When a garland is switched on, it periodically changes its state — sometimes it is lit, sometimes not. Formally, if i-th garland is switched on during x-th second, then it is lit only during seconds x, x + ki, x + 2ki, x + 3ki and so on.

Mishka wants to switch on the garlands in such a way that during each second after switching the garlands on there would be at least one lit garland. Formally, Mishka wants to choose three integers x1, x2 and x3 (not necessarily distinct) so that he will switch on the first garland during x1-th second, the second one — during x2-th second, and the third one — during x3-th second, respectively, and during each second starting from max(x1, x2, x3) at least one garland will be lit.

Help Mishka by telling him if it is possible to do this!

Input

The first line contains three integers k1, k2 and k3 (1 ≤ ki ≤ 1500) — time intervals of the garlands.

Output

If Mishka can choose moments of time to switch on the garlands in such a way that each second after switching the garlands on at least one garland will be lit, print YES.

Otherwise, print NO.

Examples

Input

2 2 3


Output

YES


Input

4 2 3


Output

NO

Note

In the first example Mishka can choose x1 = 1, x2 = 2, x3 = 1. The first garland will be lit during seconds 1, 3, 5, 7, ..., the second — 2, 4, 6, 8, ..., which already cover all the seconds after the 2-nd one. It doesn't even matter what x3 is chosen. Our choice will lead third to be lit during seconds 1, 4, 7, 10, ..., though.

In the second example there is no way to choose such moments of time, there always be some seconds when no garland is lit.

(F) Program Solving the Problem Statement

#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
const int M = 100, N = 1000;
int k[3], kmax, lit[N + 1];
bool check(int n = 0, int xmax = 0) {
  if (n == 3) {
    for (int y = xmax; y <= N; y++)
      if (!lit[y]) return false;
    return true;
  }
  int p = n + 1, q = k[n];
  for (int x = 0; x <= M; x++) {
    for (int y = x; y <= N; y += q) lit[y]++;
    if (check(p, max(x, xmax))) return true;
    for (int y = x; y <= N; y += q) lit[y]--;
  }
  return false;
}
int main() {
  for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) cin >> k[i];
  sort(k, k + 3), kmax = k[2];

assistant: ### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Comparison of Line-Level Hit Counts:**

   - The `check` function at line 5 shows extremely high hit counts in the slow input compared to the fast input (1,040,604 vs. 106).
   - Lines 7 and 8 inside the `check` function also have significantly higher hit counts for the slow input (3,619,808 vs. 1,252).
   - The nested loop starting at line 12 and the line 13 incrementing `lit[y]` show drastically more hits in the slow input (331,278,056 vs. 33,992).

2. **Pinpointing Inefficient Code Segments:**

   - **Recursive Function `check`:** The high number of recursive calls in the slow case suggests a deep or wide recursion tree, likely due to excessive branching or repeated calculations.
   - **Nested loops at line 13 and line 15:** These loops contribute heavily to the hit count, indicating that operations inside these loops are performed a large number of times.

3. **Interaction with Data Structures:**

   - The use of the `lit` array indicates repeated updates and checks over a large range, especially with nested loops iterating over this array.
   - The constraints (like `n <= 100` and `k[i] <= 1500`) suggest that the inefficiency arises not from the array size itself but from the way it's accessed repeatedly in nested or recursive structures.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **Recursive Depth and Branching:**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "If the recursion explores a deep or wide search space, as indicated by a high number of recursive calls or checks, the computation time may increase significantly. This is often triggered when the periodic intervals of the garlands are such that they require checking many combinations or states."
   
2. **Nested Loop Operations:**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "If nested loops perform operations on a shared data structure (like the `lit` array) across a large range or with high frequency, especially when combined with recursive calls, the program may slow down due to excessive computation or repeated state changes."

3. **Interaction of Periodic Intervals:**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "When the periodic intervals (`k1`, `k2`, `k3`) of the garlands lead to complex overlap or require many adjustments (increment/decrement operations), this can result in increased computational overhead due to the need for exhaustive checking of all possible switch-on times."

These invariants focus on the conditions under which the program is likely to experience slowdowns, emphasizing recursive depth, nested loop iterations, and the interaction between periodic intervals and state changes. The thresholds for these conditions are abstracted from numeric values and instead focus on patterns and structural complexities in the input and computation.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
Mishka is decorating the Christmas tree. He has got three garlands, and all of them will be put on the tree. After that Mishka will switch these garlands on.

When a garland is switched on, it periodically changes its state — sometimes it is lit, sometimes not. Formally, if i-th garland is switched on during x-th second, then it is lit only during seconds x, x + ki, x + 2ki, x + 3ki and so on.

Mishka wants to switch on the garlands in such a way that during each second after switching the garlands on there would be at least one lit garland. Formally, Mishka wants to choose three integers x1, x2 and x3 (not necessarily distinct) so that he will switch on the first garland during x1-th second, the second one — during x2-th second, and the third one — during x3-th second, respectively, and during each second starting from max(x1, x2, x3) at least one garland will be lit.

Help Mishka by telling him if it is possible to do this!

Input

The first line contains three integers k1, k2 and k3 (1 ≤ ki ≤ 1500) — time intervals of the garlands.

Output

If Mishka can choose moments of time to switch on the garlands in such a way that each second after switching the garlands on at least one garland will be lit, print YES.

Otherwise, print NO.

Examples

Input

2 2 3


Output

YES


Input

4 2 3


Output

NO

Note

In the first example Mishka can choose x1 = 1, x2 = 2, x3 = 1. The first garland will be lit during seconds 1, 3, 5, 7, ..., the second — 2, 4, 6, 8, ..., which already cover all the seconds after the 2-nd one. It doesn't even matter what x3 is chosen. Our choice will lead third to be lit during seconds 1, 4, 7, 10, ..., though.

In the second example there is no way to choose such moments of time, there always be some seconds when no garland is lit.

Solution (C++ code):
{solution}


assistant: ### Phase 3: Implement the Natural Language Invariants in C++

Below are the C++ code snippets to implement the performance-characterizing invariants inferred previously. Each snippet checks a specific condition at runtime, guarding against potential performance bottlenecks.

1. **Recursive Depth and Branching:**

    ```cpp
    void check_recursion_invariant(int depth, int maxDepth) {
        if (depth > maxDepth) {
            cerr << "Warning: Recursion depth invariant triggered - excessive recursion depth" << endl;
            abort();
        }
    }
    ```

2. **Nested Loop Operations:**

    ```cpp
    void check_loop_invariant(int iterations, int threshold) {
        if (iterations > threshold) {
            cerr << "Warning: Loop invariant triggered - excessive iterations in nested loops" << endl;
            abort();
        }
    }
    ```

### Phase 4: Integrate the Checker Code into the Original Program

Below is the original program with the integrated runtime checks to detect potential performance bottlenecks.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

const int M = 100, N = 1000;
int k[3], kmax, lit[N + 1];

// Recursive depth check
void check_recursion_invariant(int depth, int maxDepth) {
    if (depth > maxDepth) {
        cerr << "Warning: Recursion depth invariant triggered - excessive recursion depth" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Nested loop iteration check
void check_loop_invariant(int iterations, int threshold) {
    if (iterations > threshold) {
        cerr << "Warning: Loop invariant triggered - excessive iterations in nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

bool check(int n = 0, int xmax = 0, int depth = 0) {
    check_recursion_invariant(depth, 100); // Check for excessive recursion depth
    
    if (n == 3) {
        for (int y = xmax; y <= N; y++)
            if (!lit[y]) return false;
        return true;
    }

    int p = n + 1, q = k[n];
    int loopIterations = 0;
    
    for (int x = 0; x <= M; x++) {
        check_loop_invariant(++loopIterations, 1000); // Check for excessive loop iterations
        
        for (int y = x; y <= N; y += q) lit[y]++;
        if (check(p, max(x, xmax), depth + 1)) return true;
        for (int y = x; y <= N; y += q) lit[y]--;
    }
    return false;
}

int main() {
    for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) cin >> k[i];
    sort(k, k + 3), kmax = k[2];
    
    if (check())
        cout << "YES";
    else
        cout << "NO";
}
```

### Explanation

- **Recursion Depth Check:** Before every recursive call in `check`, the program verifies that the recursion depth does not exceed a predefined threshold (100 in this case). This prevents excessive recursion that can lead to slowdowns.
  
- **Nested Loop Iteration Check:** Within the nested loop, a counter tracks the number of iterations, and the program ensures it remains below a certain threshold (1000 here). This avoids excessive computations inside nested loops, which can cause performance issues.

These checks are strategically placed to detect and prevent situations that could lead to significant performance degradation, without adding unnecessary overhead in the program’s main logic flow.
