=== Invariants Response ===
To diagnose the performance bottleneck in the provided C code and derive performance-characterizing invariants, let's go through the phases:

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Comparison of Hit Counts**:
   - The `check()` function is called significantly more times for the slow input (`3 3 2`) compared to the fast input (`2 3 2`).
   - Specifically, the recursive calls within `check()` (lines 12, 13, and 14) are hit excessively in the slow input. The line hit counts for these lines are drastically higher in the slow input.

2. **Pinpoint Lines with High Hits**:
   - Line 12: Incrementing `lit[y]` within a nested loop is executed very frequently.
   - Line 13: The recursive call to `check()` suggests a deep recursion or a large number of recursive invocations.
   - Line 14: Decrementing `lit[y]` also mirrors line 12 in terms of execution frequency.

3. **Interaction with Data Structures**:
   - The `lit` array serves as a marker for seconds when a garland is lit. The loop iterates over this array many times to set and unset the markers, indicating possible inefficiencies.
   - The recursion depth and branching factor in the recursive `check()` function likely grow significantly with certain input patterns, causing performance degradation.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the analysis above, we can formulate natural language performance invariants:

1. **Invariant 1**: "When the time intervals \( k_1, k_2, \) and \( k_3 \) are close in value, especially if they are multiples of each other or very similar, the recursion depth in `check()` can grow, leading to excessive recomputation and slowdown."

2. **Invariant 2**: "If the time intervals \( k_1, k_2, \) and \( k_3 \) have a common factor or similar periodicity, the nested loop in the `check()` function may execute a high number of iterations, exponentially increasing the time complexity."

3. **Invariant 3**: "When the largest interval \( k_{\text{max}} \) is not effectively utilized to light up remaining gaps early in the sequence, the program spends more time in deeper recursion levels, checking overlapping configurations."

### Conclusion

The performance bottleneck is primarily due to the recursive nature of the `check()` function, which explores potential configurations through deep recursion and nested loops across the `lit` array. The code is particularly sensitive to the similarity or periodic relationships between the time intervals \( k_1, k_2, \) and \( k_3 \). Recognizing such patterns can help identify inputs that may cause slow performance in this algorithm.

### Phase 3: Implementing the Invariants as Runtime Checks in C++

Based on the performance-characterizing invariants derived earlier, we will create C++ code snippets that check these conditions at runtime. Below are the checker functions for each invariant:

1. **Invariant 1**: When the time intervals \( k_1, k_2, \) and \( k_3 \) are close in value.
   - Since closeness might lead to a deeper recursion, define a threshold for "closeness" where the maximum and minimum values of \( k_i \) are within a small range.
   
```cpp
void check_closeness_invariant(int* k) {
    if ((k[2] - k[0]) <= 2) {  // Arbitrary threshold for closeness
        cerr << "Warning: Closeness invariant triggered - intervals are very close!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

2. **Invariant 2**: If the time intervals have a common factor.
   - A simple way to detect a common factor is to check their greatest common divisor (GCD).

```cpp
#include <numeric> // for std::gcd

void check_common_factor_invariant(int* k) {
    int gcd12 = std::gcd(k[0], k[1]);
    int gcd123 = std::gcd(gcd12, k[2]);
    if (gcd123 > 1) {
        cerr << "Warning: Common factor invariant triggered - intervals have a common factor!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

3. **Invariant 3**: If the largest interval \( k_{\text{max}} \) is not effectively utilized.
   - Since this is an abstract invariant, we'll need to check if the largest value among \( k \) doesn't help to reduce recursion depth effectively. This can be approached by ensuring that the maximum interval isn't too large compared to the others.

```cpp
void check_ineffective_max_invariant(int* k) {
    if (k[2] > 2 * (k[0] + k[1])) {  // Arbitrary ratio threshold
        cerr << "Warning: Ineffective max invariant triggered - maximum interval is too large!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrating Checkers with the Original Program

Now, we integrate these checker functions into the original C++ program. The checks will be placed after reading the input values and before entering the recursion to ensure they do not add overhead in tight loops.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
const int N = 1000, M = 100;
int k[3], kmax, lit[N];

void check_closeness_invariant(int* k) {
    if ((k[2] - k[0]) <= 2) {  // Arbitrary threshold for closeness
        cerr << "Warning: Closeness invariant triggered - intervals are very close!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

#include <numeric> // for std::gcd
void check_common_factor_invariant(int* k) {
    int gcd12 = std::gcd(k[0], k[1]);
    int gcd123 = std::gcd(gcd12, k[2]);
    if (gcd123 > 1) {
        cerr << "Warning: Common factor invariant triggered - intervals have a common factor!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_ineffective_max_invariant(int* k) {
    if (k[2] > 2 * (k[0] + k[1])) {  // Arbitrary ratio threshold
        cerr << "Warning: Ineffective max invariant triggered - maximum interval is too large!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

bool check(int n = 0, int xmax = 0) {
    if (n == 3) {
        for (int y = xmax; y < N; y++)
            if (!lit[y]) return false;
        return true;
    }
    for (int p = n + 1, q = k[n], x = 0; x < M; x++) {
        for (int y = x; y < N; y += q) lit[y]++;
        if (check(p, max(x, xmax))) return true;
        for (int y = x; y < N; y += q) lit[y]--;
    }
    return false;
}

int main() {
    for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) cin >> k[i];
    sort(k, k + 3), kmax = k[2];

    // Perform checks for potential performance bottlenecks
    check_closeness_invariant(k);
    check_common_factor_invariant(k);
    check_ineffective_max_invariant(k);

    if (check())
        cout << "YES";
    else
        cout << "NO";
}
```

### Explanation

- **Closeness Check**: This check is meant to catch when \( k_1, k_2, \) and \( k_3 \) are too similar, potentially causing excessive recursion.
- **Common Factor Check**: This ensures that the intervals avoid sharing a common divisor that could increase repetition in lighting conditions.
- **Ineffective Max Check**: This ensures that the largest interval isn't disproportionately larger than the others, which might not help in reducing the recursion search space effectively.

These checks are added after input handling and before entering the main recursive logic, ensuring they help identify conditions leading to slow execution during testing or fuzzing.
