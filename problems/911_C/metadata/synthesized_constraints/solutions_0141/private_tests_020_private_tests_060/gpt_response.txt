=== Invariants Response ===
Based on the provided problem statement, code, and hit count data, we can analyze and derive performance-characterizing invariants for the given C program. 

### Phase 1: Identifying Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Comparison of Hit Counts:**
   - **Inner Loops (Lines 11-13):** The innermost loop (line 13) shows a significant increase in hit counts for the slow input compared to the fast input. This suggests that the triple nested loops are heavily contributing to the slowdown.
   - **Innermost If Condition (Line 16):** This line is also hit significantly more often in the slow input, indicating that the evaluation of the condition inside the innermost loop is a critical factor.

2. **Data Structures and Interaction:**
   - The code uses nested loops to iterate through potential starting times for each garland, checking if all time intervals (determined by \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \)) can collectively cover every second from 0 to 27.
   - The depth of the nested loops (60 * 60 * 60 iterations) is inherently expensive when it is fully executed, leading to a slow performance.

### Phase 2: Deriving Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Given the analysis, here are natural language statements on the conditions under which the program is likely to slow down:

1. **Invariant 1: Large Iteration Space**
   - **Description:** If the smallest time interval (either \( k1 \), \( k2 \), or \( k3 \)) is greater than 3, the program will involve a large number of iterations in the triple nested loop, causing potential slowdowns.
   - **Explanation:** When none of the intervals are low enough to quickly cover the time span from 0 to 27, the program checks more combinations unnecessarily, leading to slow execution.

2. **Invariant 2: Redundant Checks in Nested Loops**
   - **Description:** If multiple garlands have the same or similar time intervals, leading to redundant evaluations within the loops, the performance may degrade.
   - **Explanation:** Repetitive checks for similar intervals result in the innermost loop condition being evaluated more times than necessary, contributing to slower performance.

3. **Invariant 3: High Modulo Operation Frequency**
   - **Description:** If the modulo operation in the condition (line 16) is executed frequently due to the nested loop structure, the performance might degrade when the intervals are such that the condition \( cnt == 28 \) is rarely met.
   - **Explanation:** Frequent checks and calculations that rarely result in a successful condition can lead to unnecessary computational overhead.

These invariants suggest that the program's performance is highly dependent on the input values for \( k1 \), \( k2 \), and \( k3 \), particularly when these values create conditions that prevent efficient early termination of the loop. By focusing on reducing unnecessary iterations and redundant checks, the program's performance can be improved.

=== Checker Response ===
Let's implement the performance-characterizing invariants derived in Phase 2 into runtime checks in C++.

### Phase 3: Implementing the Natural Language Invariants in C++

1. **Invariant 1: Large Iteration Space**
   - **Condition:** If the smallest time interval among \( k1 \), \( k2 \), or \( k3 \) is greater than 3.
   - **Checker Code:**
   ```cpp
   void check_large_iteration_space(int a, int b, int c) {
       int mn = std::min({a, b, c});
       if (mn > 3) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large iteration space!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Invariant 2: Redundant Checks in Nested Loops**
   - **Condition:** If two or more garlands have the same time interval, causing redundant evaluations.
   - **Checker Code:**
   ```cpp
   void check_redundant_checks(int a, int b, int c) {
       if (a == b || b == c || a == c) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - redundant checks in nested loops!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Invariant 3: High Modulo Operation Frequency**
   - **Condition:** This invariant is implicit in the loop structure, no specific additional check needed as it is part of the logic.
   - Instead, we will ensure the code structure supports minimizing unnecessary checks by assessing existing conditions.

### Phase 4: Integrating the Checker Code into the Original Program

Now, we integrate the checker functions into the original program at appropriate points to minimize overhead:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Phase 3: Checker Functions
void check_large_iteration_space(int a, int b, int c) {
    int mn = std::min({a, b, c});
    if (mn > 3) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large iteration space!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_redundant_checks(int a, int b, int c) {
    if (a == b || b == c || a == c) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - redundant checks in nested loops!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    int a, b, c;
    cin >> a >> b >> c;
    
    // Phase 4: Inserting Checker Calls
    check_large_iteration_space(a, b, c); // Check for large iteration space
    check_redundant_checks(a, b, c);      // Check for redundant checks in loops

    int mn = min(min(a, b), c);
    if (mn > 3) {
        cout << "NO\n";
        return 0;
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < 60; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < 60; j++) {
            for (int k = 0; k < 60; k++) {
                int cnt = 0;
                for (int t = 0; t <= 27; t++) {
                    if ((t - i) % a == 0 or (t - j) % b == 0 or (t - k) % c == 0) {
                        cnt++;
                    }
                }
                if (cnt == 28) {
                    cout << "YES\n";
                    return 0;
                }
            }
        }
    }
    cout << "NO\n";
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of Integration
- **Checker Calls:** We place the checker calls immediately after reading the inputs to catch potential performance issues early.
- **Avoiding Overhead:** By placing these checks outside the loops, we ensure that they do not introduce significant overhead during the performance-critical sections of the code.
- **Meaningful Warnings:** Each check will output a meaningful warning explaining which bottleneck condition was triggered, aiding debugging and potential optimizations during development.

The above program will now abort with a warning if any of the performance characterizing conditions are met, helping to preempt potential slowdowns.
