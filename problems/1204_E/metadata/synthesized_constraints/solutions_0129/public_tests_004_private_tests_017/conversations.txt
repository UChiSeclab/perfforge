system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

Natasha's favourite numbers are n and 1, and Sasha's favourite numbers are m and -1. One day Natasha and Sasha met and wrote down every possible array of length n+m such that some n of its elements are equal to 1 and another m elements are equal to -1. For each such array they counted its maximal prefix sum, probably an empty one which is equal to 0 (in another words, if every nonempty prefix sum is less to zero, then it is considered equal to zero). Formally, denote as f(a) the maximal prefix sum of an array a_{1, … ,l} of length l ≥ 0. Then: 

$$$f(a) = max (0, \smash{\displaystylemax_{1 ≤ i ≤ l}} ∑_{j=1}^{i} a_j )$$$

Now they want to count the sum of maximal prefix sums for each such an array and they are asking you to help. As this sum can be very large, output it modulo 998\: 244\: 853.

Input

The only line contains two integers n and m (0 ≤ n,m ≤ 2 000).

Output

Output the answer to the problem modulo 998\: 244\: 853.

Examples

Note

In the first example the only possible array is [-1,-1], its maximal prefix sum is equal to 0. 

In the second example the only possible array is [1,1], its maximal prefix sum is equal to 2. 

There are 6 possible arrays in the third example:

[1,1,-1,-1], f([1,1,-1,-1]) = 2

[1,-1,1,-1], f([1,-1,1,-1]) = 1

[1,-1,-1,1], f([1,-1,-1,1]) = 1

[-1,1,1,-1], f([-1,1,1,-1]) = 1

[-1,1,-1,1], f([-1,1,-1,1]) = 0

[-1,-1,1,1], f([-1,-1,1,1]) = 0

So the answer for the third example is 2+1+1+1+0+0 = 5.

assistant: ### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Comparison of Line-Level Hit Counts:**
   - The `dfs` function is called 15,996,001 times for the slow input and only once for the fast input. This huge difference suggests that the combination of `(2000, 2000)` input significantly increases the recursive exploration in the `dfs` function.

2. **Pinpointing Critical Lines:**
   - **Line 6:** Checks memoization cache (`mem[a][b]`) and is hit 15,996,001 times for the slow input.
   - **Line 7-9:** Handle base cases and logical branching, contributing to a high number of recursive calls.
   - **Line 11 and 15-16:** Recursively call `dfs`, which is where the recursive depth and repeated calls are concentrated.

3. **Inference on How Lines Interact with Data Structures:**
   - The `dfs` function utilizes a dynamic programming approach with memoization, but the recursive calls are still large in number due to the nature of the problem, especially when `a` and `b` are equal.
   - The recursive calls increase significantly when `a` is roughly equal to `b`, causing a large number of recursive branches to be explored. This is evident in the slow input `(2000, 2000)`, as it generates a balanced scenario requiring extensive computation.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **Natural Language Invariants:**
   - **Invariant 1: Recursive Depth and Branching:** "When both `n` and `m` are large and approximately equal, the recursive depth and the number of branches explored in the `dfs` function increase significantly, resulting in performance degradation."
   - **Invariant 2: Memoization Efficiency:** "If the memoization table is not utilized effectively due to large and equal values of `n` and `m`, the program may experience slowdown as redundant computations increase."

2. **Thresholds and Conditions:**
   - The invariants capture scenarios where `n` and `m` are both near the upper limit (2000) and equal, as this causes a maximal branching factor in the recursive `dfs` function.

3. **Correlations with Input Patterns:**
   - The slowdown is triggered when there is a large symmetry in the problem's input parameters (`n = m`), as this maximizes the potential combinations and recursive paths in the computation. 

4. **Consideration for Future Scenarios:**
   - These conditions are not only specific to `n = m = 2000` but also apply to any equally balanced scenario where `n` and `m` approach the constraint limit, ensuring robustness in detection of slow execution paths.

### Conclusion

The main performance bottleneck arises from the recursive nature of the `dfs` function, where equally large values of `n` and `m` cause a vast search space, despite memoization. This has been encapsulated in the above invariants to identify and predict slow execution scenarios effectively.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
Natasha's favourite numbers are n and 1, and Sasha's favourite numbers are m and -1. One day Natasha and Sasha met and wrote down every possible array of length n+m such that some n of its elements are equal to 1 and another m elements are equal to -1. For each such array they counted its maximal prefix sum, probably an empty one which is equal to 0 (in another words, if every nonempty prefix sum is less to zero, then it is considered equal to zero). Formally, denote as f(a) the maximal prefix sum of an array a_{1, … ,l} of length l ≥ 0. Then: 

$$$f(a) = max (0, \smash{\displaystylemax_{1 ≤ i ≤ l}} ∑_{j=1}^{i} a_j )$$$

Now they want to count the sum of maximal prefix sums for each such an array and they are asking you to help. As this sum can be very large, output it modulo 998\: 244\: 853.

Input

The only line contains two integers n and m (0 ≤ n,m ≤ 2 000).

Output

Output the answer to the problem modulo 998\: 244\: 853.

Examples

Input

0 2

Input

2 0


Output

2


Input

2 2


Output

5


Input

2000 2000


Output

674532367

Note

In the first example the only possible array is [-1,-1], its maximal prefix sum is equal to 0. 

In the second example the only possible array is [1,1], its maximal prefix sum is equal to 2. 

There are 6 possible arrays in the third example:

[1,1,-1,-1], f([1,1,-1,-1]) = 2

[1,-1,1,-1], f([1,-1,1,-1]) = 1

[1,-1,-1,1], f([1,-1,-1,1]) = 1

[-1,1,1,-1], f([-1,1,1,-1]) = 1

[-1,1,-1,1], f([-1,1,-1,1]) = 0

[-1,-1,1,1], f([-1,-1,1,1]) = 0

So the answer for the third example is 2+1+1+1+0+0 = 5.

Solution (C++ code):
{solution}


assistant: ### Phase 3: Implementing the Natural Language Invariants in C++

Based on the performance-characterizing invariants identified earlier, here are the corresponding C++ checker functions:

```cpp
void check_recursion_invariant(int n, int m) {
    // Check for deep recursion with large branching factor
    if (n >= 1500 && m >= 1500 && n == m) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high branching in recursion for large, equal `n` and `m`." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_memoization_efficiency(int n, int m) {
    // Check if memoization is not effectively utilized due to large, equal values of n and m
    if (n == m && n >= 1500) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - inefficient memoization usage for large, equal `n` and `m`." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrating the Checker Functions into the Original Program

Now, we'll integrate these checks into the provided C++ program. The checks will be added after reading the input values to ensure they are placed wisely without adding overhead to tight loops.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll, *llp;
pair<ll, ll> mem[3000][3000];

// Checker function for recursion depth and branching factor
void check_recursion_invariant(int n, int m) {
    if (n >= 1500 && m >= 1500 && n == m) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high branching in recursion for large, equal `n` and `m`." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Checker function for memoization efficiency
void check_memoization_efficiency(int n, int m) {
    if (n == m && n >= 1500) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - inefficient memoization usage for large, equal `n` and `m`." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

pair<ll, ll> dfs(int a, int b) {
  if (mem[a][b].first != 0) return mem[a][b];
  if (a == 0) return make_pair(0ll, 0ll);
  if (b == 0) return make_pair(a, 1ll);
  if (a <= b) {
    mem[a][b] =
        make_pair((dfs(a - 1, b).first + dfs(a, b - 1).first) % 998244853, 0ll);
    return mem[a][b];
  }
  mem[a][b] =
      make_pair(((dfs(a - 1, b).first + dfs(a, b - 1).first) +

### Explanation

- **`check_recursion_invariant`:** This function checks if the inputs `n` and `m` are both large and equal, leading to extensive recursive calls. The threshold is set to 1500, which is arbitrary yet significant, given the input constraints.
  
- **`check_memoization_efficiency`:** This function checks if memoization isn't as effective due to large, equal values of `n` and `m`, which can cause performance issues.

- These checks are added after input is read and before any computation begins to ensure the program can abort early if a potential slowdown condition is detected.
