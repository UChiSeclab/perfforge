system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

Natasha's favourite numbers are n and 1, and Sasha's favourite numbers are m and -1. One day Natasha and Sasha met and wrote down every possible array of length n+m such that some n of its elements are equal to 1 and another m elements are equal to -1. For each such array they counted its maximal prefix sum, probably an empty one which is equal to 0 (in another words, if every nonempty prefix sum is less to zero, then it is considered equal to zero). Formally, denote as f(a) the maximal prefix sum of an array a_{1, … ,l} of length l ≥ 0. Then: 

$$$f(a) = max (0, \smash{\displaystylemax_{1 ≤ i ≤ l}} ∑_{j=1}^{i} a_j )$$$

Now they want to count the sum of maximal prefix sums for each such an array and they are asking you to help. As this sum can be very large, output it modulo 998\: 244\: 853.

Input

The only line contains two integers n and m (0 ≤ n,m ≤ 2 000).

Output

Output the answer to the problem modulo 998\: 244\: 853.

Note

In the first example the only possible array is [-1,-1], its maximal prefix sum is equal to 0. 

In the second example the only possible array is [1,1], its maximal prefix sum is equal to 2. 

There are 6 possible arrays in the third example:

[1,1,-1,-1], f([1,1,-1,-1]) = 2

[1,-1,1,-1], f([1,-1,1,-1]) = 1

[1,-1,-1,1], f([1,-1,-1,1]) = 1

[-1,1,1,-1], f([-1,1,1,-1]) = 1

[-1,1,-1,1], f([-1,1,-1,1]) = 0

[-1,-1,1,1], f([-1,-1,1,1]) = 0

So the answer for the third example is 2+1+1+1+0+0 = 5.

assistant: To analyze the provided C program for performance bottlenecks, we will follow the tasks outlined and derive performance-characterizing invariants from the code and hit count information.

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Comparison of Line-level Hit Counts**:
   - The hit count information indicates which lines were executed more frequently for the slow input compared to the fast input. Notably, lines 46, 49, 52, 57, 58, 59, 60, and 61 have significantly higher hit counts in the slow run.

2. **Pinpointing Lines/Functions with Significant Hits**:
   - The `for` loops in lines 45-47 and 56-61 are heavily executed. These loops are nested and iterate over `n` and `m`, which are both 2000 for the slow input.
   - The function `C(x, y)` (line 20) has a high hit count, indicating that it is called extensively during the loops.

3. **Inference on Data Structures and Loop Interactions**:
   - The arrays `f` and `g` are being populated within nested loops, with combinations and prefix sums being computed repeatedly for large values of `n` and `m`.
   - The factorial calculations and combinations (line 21) have a combinatorial impact due to the nested loops, suggesting the computation of combinatorial values is a performance bottleneck.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-characterizing Invariants (Natural Language)

Given the analysis of the code and hit count data, we can describe the conditions that lead to slow execution as follows:

1. **Nested Loop Invariants**:
   - "When both `n` and `m` approach their maximum values, the number of iterations in nested loops increases quadratically, leading to a significant slowdown due to extensive combinatorial calculations."

2. **Combinatorial Function Calls**:
   - "The performance degrades when the combinatorial function `C` is repeatedly called within nested loops for large indices, causing excessive computation times for large factorial values."

3. **Matrix Population**:
   - "If arrays `f` and `g` are filled with values based on nested loop iterations over both `n` and `m`, a significant slowdown can occur due to the large size of the matrices being processed."

These invariants highlight the potential for performance issues when the input parameters (`n` and `m`) are both large, leading to extensive computations within the nested loops and repeated function calls for combinatorial calculations. These natural language statements help in understanding the broader conditions under which the code slows down, beyond relying on specific numeric values from the inputs.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
Natasha's favourite numbers are n and 1, and Sasha's favourite numbers are m and -1. One day Natasha and Sasha met and wrote down every possible array of length n+m such that some n of its elements are equal to 1 and another m elements are equal to -1. For each such array they counted its maximal prefix sum, probably an empty one which is equal to 0 (in another words, if every nonempty prefix sum is less to zero, then it is considered equal to zero). Formally, denote as f(a) the maximal prefix sum of an array a_{1, … ,l} of length l ≥ 0. Then: 

$$$f(a) = max (0, \smash{\displaystylemax_{1 ≤ i ≤ l}} ∑_{j=1}^{i} a_j )$$$

Now they want to count the sum of maximal prefix sums for each such an array and they are asking you to help. As this sum can be very large, output it modulo 998\: 244\: 853.

Input

The only line contains two integers n and m (0 ≤ n,m ≤ 2 000).

Output

Output the answer to the problem modulo 998\: 244\: 853.

Note

In the first example the only possible array is [-1,-1], its maximal prefix sum is equal to 0. 

In the second example the only possible array is [1,1], its maximal prefix sum is equal to 2. 

There are 6 possible arrays in the third example:

[1,1,-1,-1], f([1,1,-1,-1]) = 2

[1,-1,1,-1], f([1,-1,1,-1]) = 1

[1,-1,-1,1], f([1,-1,-1,1]) = 1

[-1,1,1,-1], f([-1,1,1,-1]) = 1

[-1,1,-1,1], f([-1,1,-1,1]) = 0

[-1,-1,1,1], f([-1,-1,1,1]) = 0

So the answer for the third example is 2+1+1+1+0+0 = 5.

assistant: ### Phase 3: Implement the Natural Language Invariants in C++

Here are the C++ code snippets that check for the performance conditions based on the natural language invariants derived earlier:

1. **Nested Loop Invariant**:
   ```cpp
   void check_nested_loop_invariant(int n, int m) {
       if (n > 1500 && m > 1500) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to large nested loops with n and m exceeding thresholds!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Combinatorial Function Calls Invariant**:
   ```cpp
   void check_combinatorial_function_invariant(int n, int m) {
       if (n * m > 2500000) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to excessive combinatorial function calls!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Matrix Population Invariant**:
   ```cpp
   void check_matrix_population_invariant(int n, int m) {
       if (n + m > 3000) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to large matrix population!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Integrate the Checkers with the Original C++ Program

Below is the instrumented C++ code with the integrated runtime checks. These checks are inserted at points in the code where they are most effective, without adding overhead in tight loops.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
const int SIZE = 2e3 + 5;
const long long mod = 998244853;
int n, m;
long long f[SIZE][SIZE], inv[SIZE * 2], fac[SIZE * 2], g[SIZE][SIZE];

void check_nested_loop_invariant(int n, int m) {
    if (n > 1500 && m > 1500) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to large nested loops with n and m exceeding thresholds!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_combinatorial_function_invariant(int n, int m) {
    if (n * m > 2500000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to excessive combinatorial function calls!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_matrix_population_invariant(int n, int m) {
    if (n + m > 3000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to large matrix population!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

long long qPow(long long a, long long b) {
    long long ans = 1ll;
    for (; b; b >>= 1, a = a * a % mod) {
        if (b & 1) ans = ans * a % mod;
    }
    return ans % mod;
}

void init() {
    fac[0] = fac[1] = 1ll;
    for (int i = 2; i <= n + m; ++i) fac[i] = fac[i - 1] * i % mod;
    inv[n + m] = qPow(fac[n + m], mod - 2ll);
    for (int i = n + m - 1; ~i; --i) inv[i] = inv[i + 1] * (i + 1ll) % mod;
}

long long C(int x, int y) {
    return x < y ? 0ll : fac[x] * inv[y] % mod * inv[x - y] % mod;
}

namespace GTR {
    const int bufl = 1 << 15;
    char buf[bufl], *s = buf, *t = buf;
    inline int fetch() {
        if (s == t) {
            t = (s = buf) + fread(buf, 1, bufl, stdin);
            if (s == t) return EOF;
        }
        return *s++;
    }
    inline int read() {
        int a = 0, b = 1, c = fetch();
        while (c < 48 || c > 57) b ^= c == '-', c = fetch();
        while (c >= 48 && c <= 57) a = (a << 1) + (a << 3) + c - 48, c = fetch();
        return b ? a : -a;
    }
}
using GTR::read;

int main() {
    n = read(), m = read();

    // Insert performance checkers
    check_nested_loop_invariant(n, m);
    check_combinatorial_function_invariant(n, m);
    check_matrix_population_invariant(n, m);

    if (!n) return puts("0"), 0;
    init();
    
    for (int i = 0; i <= n; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j <= m; ++j) {
            if (!i)
                g[i][j] = 1;
            else if (!j || i > j)
                g[i][j] = 0;
            else
                g[i][j] = (g[i - 1][j] + g[i][j - 1]) % mod;
        }
    }

    for (int i = 0; i <= n; ++i) f[i][0] = i, f[0][i] = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        for (int j = 1; j <= m; ++j) {
            f[i][j] = (f[i][j] + (f[i - 1][j] + C(i + j - 1, i - 1)) % mod) % mod;
            f[i][j] = (f[i][j] + ((f[i][j - 1] - C(i + j - 1, j - 1) + mod) % mod +
                                  g[i][j - 1] + mod) % mod) % mod;
        }
    }
    
    printf("%lld\n", f[n][m]);
    return 0;
}
```

### Comments:
- **Placement**: The checkers are placed immediately after reading the inputs (`n` and `m`). This ensures that any potential performance bottlenecks due to large input sizes or unfavorable conditions are caught early.
- **Checks**: The checks use thresholds that are reasonable given the problem constraints, without relying on exact values from the slow input. They prevent the execution of the main computation when potentially problematic conditions are detected.
