=== Invariants Response ===
To diagnose the performance bottlenecks in the provided C program, we will analyze the hit counts and identify potential slow paths. Then we will derive performance-characterizing invariants in natural language.

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Comparison of Line-Level Hit Counts:**
   - The `dfs1` and `dfs2` functions are significantly more hit in the slow input with `n = 2000` and `m = 2000` compared to the fast input with `n = 2000` and `m = 0`.
   - Specifically, `dfs1` receives 12,003,999 hits, and `dfs2` receives 12,006,001 hits during the slow input.
   - The `comb` function also shows a considerable number of hits, primarily associated with calls from within `dfs1` and `dfs2`.

2. **Pinpointing Lines and Functions with More Hits:**
   - `dfs1` function lines (6-15) are heavily hit in the slow run but not at all in the fast run, indicating this recursive function is invoked numerous times.
   - `dfs2` function lines (40-53) receive hits in both runs, albeit significantly more in the slow run.
   - The combination (`comb`) calculations are repeatedly executed given their high hit count, impacting the overall performance.
   
3. **Interaction with Data Structures and Recursion:**
   - The recursive nature of `dfs1` and `dfs2` suggests that significant recomputation occurs, especially with large `n` and `m`.
   - `dfs1` and `dfs2` use memoization, but the large state space for `n = 2000` and `m = 2000` implies a high number of recursive calls before memoized values are accessed.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Given the identified slow paths and function interactions, here are the performance-characterizing invariants:

1. **Invariant: High Recursive Call Depth with Large Inputs**
   - **Description:** "If both `n` and `m` are large and approximately equal, the number of recursive calls in `dfs1` and `dfs2` can grow exponentially, leading to significant slowdowns. This is exacerbated when recursion explores a large state space before hitting memoized results."
   - **Thresholds:** This condition is triggered when both `n` and `m` approach the upper limit of 2000.

2. **Invariant: Extensive Combination Calculations**
   - **Description:** "If the task involves computing combinations (`comb`) for high values of `a` and `b` repeatedly during recursive calls, the overhead from these calculations can degrade performance significantly."
   - **Thresholds:** This becomes pronounced when `a + b` approaches its maximum possible value given `n` and `m`.

3. **Invariant: Memoization Table Initialization Overhead**
   - **Description:** "If the size of `n` and `m` results in large memoization tables, the initialization phase can add overhead, although not the primary slowdown factor."
   - **Thresholds:** Noticeable when initializing arrays for `n + 1` by `m + 1` approaches 2003 by 2003.

By focusing on these conditions, future tests or inputs that fit these invariants can be identified as potential performance bottlenecks, and appropriate optimizations, such as minimizing recomputation or improving memoization strategies, can be applied.

=== Checker Response ===
### Phase 3: Implementing Checker Code for Performance Invariants

Below are the C++ code snippets for implementing the performance-characterizing invariants derived earlier. Each snippet contains a condition that, when met, indicates a potential performance bottleneck.

#### Invariant Checkers

1. **Invariant for High Recursive Call Depth with Large Inputs**
    ```cpp
    void check_recursion_invariant(int n, int m) {
        if (n > 1000 && m > 1000) { // Arbitrary threshold indicating large inputs
            cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered! High recursion depth." << endl;
            abort();
        }
    }
    ```

2. **Invariant for Extensive Combination Calculations**
    ```cpp
    void check_combination_invariant(int a, int b) {
        if ((a + b) > 3000) { // Threshold based on large state space
            cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered! Extensive combination calculations." << endl;
            abort();
        }
    }
    ```

3. **Invariant for Memoization Table Initialization Overhead**
    ```cpp
    void check_memoization_invariant(int n, int m) {
        if ((n + 1) * (m + 1) > 2003 * 2003) { // Max dimensions for memoization table
            cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered! Large memoization table initialization." << endl;
            abort();
        }
    }
    ```

### Phase 4: Integrating Checkers with the Original C++ Program

Below is the original C++ program with integrated performance invariant checks. These checks are added at strategic locations to avoid unnecessary overhead during execution.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
const long long mod = 998244853;
int n, m;
long long memo1[2003][2003];
long long memo2[2003][2003];
long long fact[(2 * 2003)], rfact[(2 * 2003)];

// Checker for high recursion depth with large inputs
void check_recursion_invariant(int n, int m) {
    if (n > 1000 && m > 1000) { // Arbitrary threshold indicating large inputs
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered! High recursion depth." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Checker for extensive combination calculations
void check_combination_invariant(int a, int b) {
    if ((a + b) > 3000) { // Threshold based on large state space
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered! Extensive combination calculations." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Checker for memoization table initialization overhead
void check_memoization_invariant(int n, int m) {
    if ((n + 1) * (m + 1) > 2003 * 2003) { // Max dimensions for memoization table
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered! Large memoization table initialization." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

long long dfs1(int a, int b) {
    if (memo1[a][b] != -1) {
        return memo1[a][b];
    }
    if (a > b) return 0;
    long long r = 0;
    if (a == 0 && b == 0) return memo1[a][b] = 1;
    if (a > 0) r += dfs1(a - 1, b);
    if (b > 0) r += dfs1(a, b - 1);
    return memo1[a][b] = r % mod;
}

long long fast_pow(long long x, long long n, long long mod) {
    long long r = 1;
    while (n) {
        if (n & 1) {
            r = r * x % mod;
        }
        x = x * x % mod;
        n >>= 1;
    }
    return r;
}

void build_fact(int l) {
    fact[0] = 1;
    for (int i = 1; i <= l; ++i) fact[i] = fact[i - 1] * i % mod;
    rfact[l] = fast_pow(fact[l], mod - 2, mod);
    for (int i = l; i > 0; --i) rfact[i - 1] = rfact[i] * i % mod;
}

long long comb(int n, int k) {
    long long r = fact[n] * rfact[k] % mod;
    return r * rfact[n - k] % mod;
}

long long dfs2(int a, int b) {
    if (memo2[a][b] != -1) {
        return memo2[a][b];
    }
    long long r = 0;
    if (a > 0) {
        r = dfs2(a - 1, b) + comb(a + b - 1, b);
    }
    if (b > 0) {
        r += dfs2(a, b - 1) + mod - comb(a + b - 1, a) + dfs1(a, b - 1);
    }
    return memo2[a][b] = r % mod;
}

int main() {
    cin >> n >> m;

    // Check for memoization table size
    check_memoization_invariant(n, m);

    for (int i = 0; i < n + 1; ++i)
        for (int j = 0; j < m + 1; ++j) memo1[i][j] = memo2[i][j] = -1;
    build_fact(n + m);

    // Check for recursion depth and combination calculations
    check_recursion_invariant(n, m);

    cout << dfs2(n, m) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of Integration:

- **`check_recursion_invariant`** is called in `main()` to ensure that entering the recursive function `dfs2` does not hit a performance bottleneck with large `n` and `m`.
- **`check_combination_invariant`** is not directly called but can be integrated within the recursive functions if necessary.
- **`check_memoization_invariant`** is called in `main()` before any large memory allocation.

These checks will help detect performance issues that could arise with large inputs, aiding in debugging and optimization efforts.
