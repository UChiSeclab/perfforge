=== Invariants Response ===
To analyze the performance bottlenecks in this C program, let's go through the task step-by-step by examining the hit counts and understanding potential slowdowns.

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Examine Hit Count Differences:**
   - The function `C(int n, int m)` is called 11,998,000 times during the slow run and not at all during the fast run.
   - The function `K(int x, int y)` is called 4,000,000 times during the slow run and not at all during the fast run.
   - The nested loop in the main function (lines 23-27) shows significant activity during the slow input, with line 25 being executed 4,002,000 times.

2. **Analyze Inefficiencies:**
   - The program computes combinations using `C(int n, int m)` frequently, which involves factorial computations and modular arithmetic, potentially causing performance overhead.
   - The function `K(int x, int y)` calls `C(int n, int m)` twice per invocation, further compounding the frequent calculations.
   - The nested loops iterate over `n` and `m`, filling out a dynamic programming table. With large values of `n` and `m` (such as 2000), the number of iterations and computations grows quadratically.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the analysis, here are natural language statements describing conditions that may trigger slow execution paths:

1. **Frequent Combination Calculations:**
   - **Invariant:** "Performance degrades significantly when the program computes combinations many times, especially when `n` and `m` are large, increasing the number of calls to the combination calculation function."

2. **Nested Loop Iterations:**
   - **Invariant:** "The nested loop structure over `n` and `m` can lead to a quadratic number of operations when both `n` and `m` are large, increasing the time complexity and causing slowdowns."

3. **Inefficient Use of Dynamic Programming Table:**
   - **Invariant:** "When the size of `n` and `m` is maximized, the dynamic programming table (`dp`) is filled in a manner that becomes computationally expensive due to extensive iteration and repeated calculations within the nested loops."

4. **Conditional Combinatorial Calculations:**
   - **Invariant:** "Conditions that require the evaluation of the `K` function, which itself calls the combination function `C` multiple times, can significantly degrade performance, especially when both `n` and `m` are high."

These statements reflect the conditions under which the program is likely to slow down when given particular input patterns. They abstract exact values, focusing instead on scenarios involving large input sizes and the resulting computational complexity.

=== Checker Response ===
Let's implement the performance-characterizing invariants as runtime checks in C++ (Phase 3) and then integrate these checks into the original program (Phase 4).

### Phase 3: Implement Runtime Checks in C++

For each invariant derived earlier, we'll create a corresponding C++ runtime check.

#### Invariant 1: Frequent Combination Calculations

**Condition Check:**
```cpp
void check_combination_invariant(int n, int m) {
    if (n > 1000 && m > 1000) { // Arbitrarily chosen threshold for illustration
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - frequent combination calculations for large n and m!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

#### Invariant 2: Nested Loop Iterations

**Condition Check:**
```cpp
void check_nested_loop_invariant(int n, int m) {
    if (n > 1000 && m > 1000) { // Threshold chosen based on quadratic loop concerns
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - nested loop iterations are expensive for large n and m!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

#### Invariant 3: Inefficient Use of Dynamic Programming Table

**Condition Check:**
```cpp
void check_dp_invariant(int n, int m) {
    if (n > 1000 && m > 1000) { // Threshold based on the dynamic programming table size
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large DP table computation!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrate Checks into the Original Program

Now, let's integrate these checks into the provided C++ code.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
const int mod = 998244853;
const int maxn = 4e3 + 10;
int n, m, fac[maxn], inv[maxn], finv[maxn], dp[2100][2100];

// Function to check combination invariant
void check_combination_invariant(int n, int m) {
    if (n > 1000 && m > 1000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - frequent combination calculations for large n and m!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Function to check nested loop invariant
void check_nested_loop_invariant(int n, int m) {
    if (n > 1000 && m > 1000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - nested loop iterations are expensive for large n and m!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Function to check dynamic programming invariant
void check_dp_invariant(int n, int m) {
    if (n > 1000 && m > 1000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large DP table computation!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int C(int n, int m) {
    if (n < 0 || m < 0 || n < m) return 0;
    return 1ll * fac[n] * finv[m] % mod * finv[n - m] % mod;
}

int K(int x, int y) {
    if (x <= y) return ((C(x + y, y) - C(x + y, y + 1)) % mod + mod) % mod;
    return 0;
}

int main() {
    scanf("%d%d", &n, &m);

    // Insert checks for performance bottlenecks
    check_combination_invariant(n, m);
    check_nested_loop_invariant(n, m);
    check_dp_invariant(n, m);

    fac[0] = inv[0] = finv[0] = 1;
    fac[1] = inv[1] = finv[1] = 1;
    for (int i = 2; i <= n + m; ++i) {
        fac[i] = 1ll * fac[i - 1] * i % mod;
        inv[i] = 1ll * inv[mod % i] * (mod - mod / i) % mod;
        finv[i] = 1ll * finv[i - 1] * inv[i] % mod;
    }
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        dp[i][0] = i;
        for (int j = 1; j <= m; ++j)
            dp[i][j] = ((C(i + j - 1, j) + dp[i - 1][j]) % mod +
                        (dp[i][j - 1] - (C(i + j - 1, i) - K(i, j - 1))) % mod) %
                       mod;
    }
    printf("%d\n", (dp[n][m] + mod) % mod);
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

- **Placement of Checks:** The checks are placed right after reading the input `n` and `m` to preemptively catch potential performance bottlenecks without adding overhead to the critical computation path.
- **Thresholds:** The threshold of `n > 1000 && m > 1000` is chosen based on the nature of the problem constraints and the significant increase in operation costs for larger values, ensuring that the checks are meaningful without being overly restrictive.
