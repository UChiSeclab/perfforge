system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

Natasha's favourite numbers are n and 1, and Sasha's favourite numbers are m and -1. One day Natasha and Sasha met and wrote down every possible array of length n+m such that some n of its elements are equal to 1 and another m elements are equal to -1. For each such array they counted its maximal prefix sum, probably an empty one which is equal to 0 (in another words, if every nonempty prefix sum is less to zero, then it is considered equal to zero). Formally, denote as f(a) the maximal prefix sum of an array a_{1, … ,l} of length l ≥ 0. Then: 

$$$f(a) = max (0, \smash{\displaystylemax_{1 ≤ i ≤ l}} ∑_{j=1}^{i} a_j )$$$

Now they want to count the sum of maximal prefix sums for each such an array and they are asking you to help. As this sum can be very large, output it modulo 998\: 244\: 853.

Input

The only line contains two integers n and m (0 ≤ n,m ≤ 2 000).

Output

Output the answer to the problem modulo 998\: 244\: 853.

Note

In the first example the only possible array is [-1,-1], its maximal prefix sum is equal to 0. 

In the second example the only possible array is [1,1], its maximal prefix sum is equal to 2. 

There are 6 possible arrays in the third example:

[1,1,-1,-1], f([1,1,-1,-1]) = 2

[1,-1,1,-1], f([1,-1,1,-1]) = 1

[1,-1,-1,1], f([1,-1,-1,1]) = 1

[-1,1,1,-1], f([-1,1,1,-1]) = 1

[-1,1,-1,1], f([-1,1,-1,1]) = 0

[-1,-1,1,1], f([-1,-1,1,1]) = 0

So the answer for the third example is 2+1+1+1+0+0 = 5.

assistant: To analyze the performance bottlenecks in this C program, let's go through the task step-by-step by examining the hit counts and understanding potential slowdowns.

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Examine Hit Count Differences:**
   - The function `C(int n, int m)` is called 11,998,000 times during the slow run and not at all during the fast run.
   - The function `K(int x, int y)` is called 4,000,000 times during the slow run and not at all during the fast run.
   - The nested loop in the main function (lines 23-27) shows significant activity during the slow input, with line 25 being executed 4,002,000 times.

2. **Analyze Inefficiencies:**
   - The program computes combinations using `C(int n, int m)` frequently, which involves factorial computations and modular arithmetic, potentially causing performance overhead.
   - The function `K(int x, int y)` calls `C(int n, int m)` twice per invocation, further compounding the frequent calculations.
   - The nested loops iterate over `n` and `m`, filling out a dynamic programming table. With large values of `n` and `m` (such as 2000), the number of iterations and computations grows quadratically.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the analysis, here are natural language statements describing conditions that may trigger slow execution paths:

1. **Frequent Combination Calculations:**
   - **Invariant:** "Performance degrades significantly when the program computes combinations many times, especially when `n` and `m` are large, increasing the number of calls to the combination calculation function."

2. **Nested Loop Iterations:**
   - **Invariant:** "The nested loop structure over `n` and `m` can lead to a quadratic number of operations when both `n` and `m` are large, increasing the time complexity and causing slowdowns."

3. **Inefficient Use of Dynamic Programming Table:**
   - **Invariant:** "When the size of `n` and `m` is maximized, the dynamic programming table (`dp`) is filled in a manner that becomes computationally expensive due to extensive iteration and repeated calculations within the nested loops."

4. **Conditional Combinatorial Calculations:**
   - **Invariant:** "Conditions that require the evaluation of the `K` function, which itself calls the combination function `C` multiple times, can significantly degrade performance, especially when both `n` and `m` are high."

These statements reflect the conditions under which the program is likely to slow down when given particular input patterns. They abstract exact values, focusing instead on scenarios involving large input sizes and the resulting computational complexity.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
Natasha's favourite numbers are n and 1, and Sasha's favourite numbers are m and -1. One day Natasha and Sasha met and wrote down every possible array of length n+m such that some n of its elements are equal to 1 and another m elements are equal to -1. For each such array they counted its maximal prefix sum, probably an empty one which is equal to 0 (in another words, if every nonempty prefix sum is less to zero, then it is considered equal to zero). Formally, denote as f(a) the maximal prefix sum of an array a_{1, … ,l} of length l ≥ 0. Then: 

$$$f(a) = max (0, \smash{\displaystylemax_{1 ≤ i ≤ l}} ∑_{j=1}^{i} a_j )$$$

Now they want to count the sum of maximal prefix sums for each such an array and they are asking you to help. As this sum can be very large, output it modulo 998\: 244\: 853.

Input

The only line contains two integers n and m (0 ≤ n,m ≤ 2 000).

Output

Output the answer to the problem modulo 998\: 244\: 853.

Note

In the first example the only possible array is [-1,-1], its maximal prefix sum is equal to 0. 

In the second example the only possible array is [1,1], its maximal prefix sum is equal to 2. 

There are 6 possible arrays in the third example:

[1,1,-1,-1], f([1,1,-1,-1]) = 2

[1,-1,1,-1], f([1,-1,1,-1]) = 1

[1,-1,-1,1], f([1,-1,-1,1]) = 1

[-1,1,1,-1], f([-1,1,1,-1]) = 1

[-1,1,-1,1], f([-1,1,-1,1]) = 0

[-1,-1,1,1], f([-1,-1,1,1]) = 0

So the answer for the third example is 2+1+1+1+0+0 = 5.

Solution (C++ code):
{solution}


assistant: Let's implement the performance-characterizing invariants as runtime checks in C++ (Phase 3) and then integrate these checks into the original program (Phase 4).

### Phase 3: Implement Runtime Checks in C++

For each invariant derived earlier, we'll create a corresponding C++ runtime check.

#### Invariant 1: Frequent Combination Calculations

**Condition Check:**
```cpp
void check_combination_invariant(int n, int m) {
    if (n > 1000 && m > 1000) { // Arbitrarily chosen threshold for illustration
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - frequent combination calculations for large n and m!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

#### Invariant 2: Nested Loop Iterations

**Condition Check:**
```cpp
void check_nested_loop_invariant(int n, int m) {
    if (n > 1000 && m > 1000) { // Threshold chosen based on quadratic loop concerns
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - nested loop iterations are expensive for large n and m!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

#### Invariant 3: Inefficient Use of Dynamic Programming Table

**Condition Check:**
```cpp
void check_dp_invariant(int n, int m) {
    if (n > 1000 && m > 1000) { // Threshold based on the dynamic programming table size
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large DP table computation!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrate Checks into the Original Program

Now, let's integrate these checks into the provided C++ code.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
const int mod = 998244853;
const int maxn = 4e3 + 10;
int n, m, fac[maxn], inv[maxn], finv[maxn], dp[2100][2100];

### Explanation

- **Placement of Checks:** The checks are placed right after reading the input `n` and `m` to preemptively catch potential performance bottlenecks without adding overhead to the critical computation path.
- **Thresholds:** The threshold of `n > 1000 && m > 1000` is chosen based on the nature of the problem constraints and the significant increase in operation costs for larger values, ensuring that the checks are meaningful without being overly restrictive.
