=== Invariants Response ===
To identify performance bottlenecks in the given C program and derive conditions that trigger slow execution, let's first analyze the code with respect to hit counts provided for both "slow" and "fast" inputs.

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Hit Count Analysis:**
   - The main loop at lines 60 to 71 is executed much more frequently for the slow input (`2000 2000`) compared to the fast input (`0 2000`). Specifically, the nested loop (lines 61 to 71) has a significantly higher hit count for the slow input.
   - The function `C` (lines 45 to 47) is called very frequently, with hit counts reflecting its repeated invocation within the inner loop.
   - Lines 62 to 69 perform calculations involving combinations and modulo operations, which are computationally expensive due to repeated invocations.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - The inner nested loop iterating over `i` and `j` is the main contributor to the slowdown. Since both `n` and `m` are high (up to 2000), it results in `O(n * m)` operations.
   - The `C` function is particularly expensive because it computes binomial coefficients, which involves factorial calculations and multiple modulo operations.
   - The condition `if (i <= j - 1)` adds additional complexity when satisfied, triggering further operations inside the loop.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the analysis, here are the natural language statements describing conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path:

1. **High Combination Calculations:**
   - "When both `n` and `m` are close to their upper constraint (`2000`), the program executes a large number of combination calculations, leading to significant slowdowns."
   - This captures the extensive calls to `C(i + j - 1, i - 1)` and `C(i + j - 1, i)` within the nested loops, which are bottlenecks due to factorial computations.

2. **Nested Loop Execution:**
   - "If `n` and `m` are both large, the nested loops perform `O(n * m)` operations, which becomes computationally intensive and leads to slow performance."
   - This identifies the core computational load arising from the loop structure, where each iteration involves multiple arithmetic and modulus operations.

3. **Additional Condition Complexity:**
   - "The condition `i <= j - 1` if frequently met when `m` is large relative to `n`, further increasing computational complexity and slowing down execution."
   - This highlights the additional operations performed within the loop when the condition is satisfied, contributing to the slowdown.

These performance-characterizing invariants help abstractly understand the condition under which the program slows, especially with input patterns where both `n` and `m` approach their maximum values, and the nested loop's impact is maximized.

### Phase 3: Implementing the Invariants as C++ Checkers

Let's translate the natural language invariants derived in Phase 2 into specific C++ code snippets that can be used to check these conditions during runtime.

#### Invariant 1: High Combination Calculations

```cpp
void check_combination_calculations(int n, int m) {
    if (n > 1500 && m > 1500) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high combination calculations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

#### Invariant 2: Nested Loop Execution

```cpp
void check_nested_loop_execution(int n, int m) {
    if (n * m > 3000000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - nested loop execution!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

#### Invariant 3: Additional Condition Complexity

```cpp
void check_additional_condition(int n, int m) {
    if (m > n) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - additional condition complexity!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrating the Checkers into the Original Program

Now, let's integrate these checkers into the original C++ program at points that minimize additional overhead, while allowing us to detect when these conditions are met.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

void check_combination_calculations(int n, int m) {
    if (n > 1500 && m > 1500) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high combination calculations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_nested_loop_execution(int n, int m) {
    if (n * m > 3000000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - nested loop execution!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_additional_condition(int n, int m) {
    if (m > n) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - additional condition complexity!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void in(initializer_list<int *> li) {
    for (auto ptr = li.begin(); ptr != li.end(); ptr++) scanf("%d", *ptr);
}

void in(initializer_list<long long *> li) {
    for (auto ptr = li.begin(); ptr != li.end(); ptr++) scanf("%lld", *ptr);
}

void in(initializer_list<double *> li) {
    for (auto ptr = li.begin(); ptr !=
