=== Invariants Response ===
To tackle this task, we need to analyze the code and determine the areas that cause the performance bottleneck, especially under certain input conditions. Let's break it down into the specified phases:

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Line-level Comparison:**
   - The inner loop (`for (int b = 0; b <= 100; b++)`) inside the nested loop is executed significantly more times for the slow input compared to the fast input. Specifically, `slow_hit_count` is 484,194 compared to `fast_hit_count` of 20,604.

2. **Pinpointing Problematic Lines:**
   - Lines 11-13 are the most frequently hit, with the inner loop (line 12) being the main contributor to the slowdown. This suggests that the combination of the two nested loops is exploring a large search space unnecessarily for the input.

3. **Interaction with Data Structures and Algorithms:**
   - The loops try every combination of `a` (0 to 100) and `b` (0 to 100) to check if a solution exists where `3a + 7b = n`. This brute-force approach is inefficient for the current inputs.
   - The line `if (a * 3 + b * 7 == n && r)` is only doing useful work when the sum equals `n`, otherwise, it performs redundant calculations.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **Conditions Leading to Slow Path:**
   - **Invariant 1:** If the value of `n` is such that it's not expressible as `3a + 7b` for small values of `a` and `b`, the inner loop will be executed 10,201 times per test case without finding a solution, leading to a slowdown.
   - **Invariant 2:** When multiple test cases are provided with similar unresolvable values repeatedly, the program spends a lot of computation effort re-evaluating the same inefficient loops.

2. **Natural Language Statements:**
   - **Invariant 1 Description:** "When `n` is a small non-combinable number (like 1 or 2) which cannot be expressed as a sum of multiples of 3 and 7, the nested loop will explore an excessive number of combinations without finding a solution."
   - **Invariant 2 Description:** "If the input contains multiple instances of small, non-combinable numbers, the program may suffer from repeated inefficient loop executions leading to a performance bottleneck."

3. **Threshold Values Aligned with Constraints:**
   - We ensure our descriptions consider the constraints (`1 ≤ n ≤ 100`) and focus on patterns or properties of numbers that make it difficult to express as `3a + 7b`.

### Summary of Performance-Characterizing Invariants:

- **Invariant 1:** "For test cases where `n` is a number like 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, or others that cannot be expressed as any combination of sums of 3 and 7, the program will inefficiently cycle through all possible combinations without finding a valid solution, causing slow performance."
  
- **Invariant 2:** "If the input consists of multiple test cases with similar non-combinable numbers repeatedly, the function's inefficiency compounds, resulting in a noticeable slowdown due to redundant computations."

These statements help in understanding when and why the performance bottleneck occurs and can guide further optimization or refactoring efforts to mitigate inefficiencies.

=== Checker Response ===
### Phase 3: Implement the Natural Language Invariants as C++ Checkers

To implement the performance-characterizing invariants as C++ checkers, we'll create conditions as described in the natural language statements and use them to trigger warnings and abort execution if the conditions are met. 

1. **Invariant 1 Checker**: For numbers that cannot be expressed as `3a + 7b`, such as 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, etc., within a reasonable threshold, we can apply a modulus check and precondition common combinations that cannot be formed.

```cpp
void check_non_combinable_invariant(int n) {
    // Check for numbers that are not expressible as 3a + 7b
    if (n % 3 == 1 || n % 3 == 2) {
        cerr << "Warning: Non-combinable number invariant triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

2. **Invariant 2 Checker**: To capture repeated input of problematic numbers, we can maintain a count of such numbers and trigger a warning when a threshold is exceeded.

```cpp
void check_repeated_non_combinable_invariant(int count) {
    // If several non-combinable numbers are received, a performance bottleneck is likely
    if (count > 5) {  // Arbitrary threshold for detection
        cerr << "Warning: Repeated non-combinable number invariant triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrate Checkers with Original Code

Now, we will integrate these checkers into the original C++ code. The checkers will be inserted at effective points in the program's workflow, without adding overhead to the inner loops.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Checker functions to detect performance bottlenecks
void check_non_combinable_invariant(int n) {
    if (n % 3 == 1 || n % 3 == 2) {
        cerr << "Warning: Non-combinable number invariant triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_repeated_non_combinable_invariant(int count) {
    if (count > 5) {
        cerr << "Warning: Repeated non-combinable number invariant triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    iostream::sync_with_stdio(0);
    
    int x;
    cin >> x;
    int non_combinable_count = 0; // Track non-combinable numbers
    
    for (int i = 0; i < x; i++) {
        int n;
        cin >> n;
        
        // Check for non-combinable number invariant
        check_non_combinable_invariant(n);
        
        bool r = true;
        for (int a = 0; a <= 100; a++) {
            for (int b = 0; b <= 100; b++) {
                if (a * 3 + b * 7 == n && r) {
                    cout << "YES" << endl;
                    r = false;
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
        if (r) {
            cout << "NO" << endl;
            non_combinable_count++;
        }
    }
    
    // Check for repeated non-combinable numbers invariant
    check_repeated_non_combinable_invariant(non_combinable_count);
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

- **Non-combinable Checker**: The checker function `check_non_combinable_invariant` is invoked for each input number. If the number falls into a category where it's likely to fail the combinability test, it raises an alert.
- **Repeated Non-combinable Checker**: We track the number of failures to combine chicken chunks (non-combinable numbers). If this count exceeds a certain threshold (`count > 5`), it points to inefficient handling due to repeated problematic inputs, hence the alert.

These checkers aim to help identify problematic scenarios during runtime, indicating where the program might slow down due to inherent inefficiencies in handling particular input patterns.
