### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

**Line-Level Analysis:**

- **Line 14 (`for (int i = 0; i <= 100; i++)`):**
  - **Slow Input Hit Count:** 4794
  - **Fast Input Hit Count:** 204
  - **Observation:** This outer loop runs significantly more times for the slow input, indicating repeated iterations without early termination.

- **Line 16 (`for (int j = 0; j <= 100; j++)`):**
  - **Slow Input Hit Count:** 484,194
  - **Fast Input Hit Count:** 20,604
  - **Observation:** The inner loop runs a massive number of times for the slow input, indicating that the condition `i * 3 + j * 7 == x` is rarely satisfied early.

- **Line 17 (`if (i * 3 + j * 7 == x)`):**
  - **Slow Input Hit Count:** 479,447
  - **Fast Input Hit Count:** 20,402
  - **Observation:** The condition check is performed extensively, suggesting that combinations of `i` and `j` are inefficiently explored, particularly when the desired number of chunks `x` cannot be composed from available portion sizes.

From the analysis, the main performance bottleneck is the nested loop structure iterating over `i` and `j`, both going up to 100, yielding up to 10,000 iterations per query, particularly when the condition is rarely satisfied early or not at all.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **Repeated Unsuccessful Combinations:**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "When the desired number of chicken chunks `x` is such that no combination of small (3 chunks) and large (7 chunks) portions can satisfy the requirement early in the iteration, the program spends excessive time exploring combinations."
   - **Reasoning:** Inputs for which no solution exists (e.g., `x = 1`) cause the loops to fully execute all iterations, resulting in unnecessary computation.

2. **Threshold for Combinations:**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "For certain values of `x` that are neither multiples of 3 nor reach a total count quickly with combinations of small and large portions, such as low values like `x = 1` or those requiring many iterations to find a solution, the execution becomes slow."
   - **Reasoning:** Values that require complete iteration over both loops without satisfying the condition early cause slow execution.

3. **High Iteration Count for No-Solution Cases:**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "If the number of desired chunks `x` leads to no possible solution (e.g., `x` is less than 3 or results in a remainder when divided by 3 or 7 with no valid combinations), the program exhibits poor performance due to extensive looping."
   - **Reasoning:** Ensuring quick termination or recognizing impossible cases early would prevent lengthy iterations.

These invariants help characterize scenarios where the nested loop structure leads to performance degradation due to the nature of the input values and the lack of early exits or optimizations in solving the linear combination problem.

### Phase 3: Implement the Natural Language Invariants in C++

Here we translate each of the identified performance-characterizing invariants into C++ code checks:

1. **Repeated Unsuccessful Combinations:**

```cpp
void check_unsuccessful_combinations(int x) {
    if (x < 3 || (x % 3 != 0 && x % 7 != 0 && (x < 10 || x > 90))) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered for x = " << x << "!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

2. **Threshold for Combinations:**

```cpp
void check_threshold_combinations(int x, int iterationCount) {
    if (iterationCount > 10000) {
        cerr << "Warning: High iteration count for x = " << x << "!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

3. **High Iteration Count for No-Solution Cases:**

```cpp
void check_no_solution_iterations(int x, bool foundSolution) {
    if (!foundSolution && x <= 10) {
        cerr << "Warning: Extensive iterations for no-solution case for x = " << x << "!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrate the Checker Code into the Original C++ Program

Here's the C++ program with integrated checker functions:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#pragma comment(linker, "/STACK:5000000000")
const unsigned long long mod = 1000000007;
long long Inf = (long long)2e9;
long long LINF = (long long)1e18 + 1e17;
using namespace std;

// Checker function to detect performance bottlenecks
void check_unsuccessful_combinations(int x) {
    // Detects when x is unlikely to have a solution early in iterations
    if (x < 3 || (x % 3 != 0 && x % 7 != 0 && (x < 10 || x > 90))) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered for x = " << x << "!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Checker function to monitor high iteration counts
void check_threshold_combinations(int x, int iterationCount) {
    if (iterationCount > 10000) {
        cerr << "Warning: High iteration count for x = " << x << "!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Checker for extensive iterations in no-solution cases
void check_no_solution_iterations(int x, bool foundSolution) {
    if (!foundSolution && x <= 10) {
        cerr << "Warning: Extensive iterations for no-solution case for x = " << x << "!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    int n;
    scanf("%d", &(n));
    while (n--) {
        int x;
        scanf("%d", &(x));

        // Insert checker for repeated unsuccessful combinations
        check_unsuccessful_combinations(x);

        bool f = false;
        int iterationCount = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i <= 100; i++) {
            bool flag = false;
            for (int j = 0; j <= 100; j++) {
                iterationCount++;
                if (i * 3 + j * 7 == x) {
                    flag = 1;
                    f = 1;
                    break;
                }
            }
        }

        // Insert checker for high iteration counts
        check_threshold_combinations(x, iterationCount);

        // Insert checker for extensive iterations in no-solution cases
        check_no_solution_iterations(x, f);

        if (f)
            puts("YES");
        else
            puts("NO");
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of Inserted Checks:

1. **Check for Repeated Unsuccessful Combinations:**
   - This check is placed after reading the input `x` to determine if the chunks cannot be formed early in the iteration process, preventing unnecessary computation.
   
2. **Check for High Iteration Count:**
   - This check is placed after the nested loops to abort if the iterations exceed a threshold, indicating inefficient search for combinations.

3. **Check for Extensive Iterations in No-Solution Cases:**
   - This is added to detect cases where no valid `(a, b)` combination exists, especially for smaller values of `x`, thus indicating a potential inefficiency.

These checks are strategically placed to help in identifying and aborting on conditions that lead to performance bottlenecks without adding overhead in the tight loop.
