### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

Based on the provided hit count information, we can identify the following insights:

1. **Outer Loop (Line 6)**: This loop executes the number of test cases, which is significantly higher for the slow input (47 vs. 2). This alone increases overhead but is expected due to more test cases.

2. **Nested Loops (Lines 10-11)**: These loops are crucial performance bottlenecks. The outer loop iterates 101 times for values of `i`, and the inner loop does the same for `j`, leading to 10,201 iterations per test case. For the slow input which has 47 test cases, this results in 479,447 iterations of the condition check `if (3 * i + 7 * j == x)`.

3. **Condition Check (Line 12)**: This line is executed over 479,447 times in the slow input, compared to only 20,402 times in the fast input. This indicates that a significant amount of time is spent evaluating this condition.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

From the analysis, we can derive the following performance-characterizing invariants in natural language:

1. **Invariant 1: High Test Case Count**  
   - **Natural Language Description**: "When the number of test cases is large, combined with the inefficient computation in nested loops, performance degrades significantly."
   - **Explanation**: A higher number of test cases (`n`) directly increases the total number of iterations of the nested loops.

2. **Invariant 2: Inefficient Search Space in Nested Loops**  
   - **Natural Language Description**: "When the target number of chunks is such that many combinations of portions need to be checked, the program may run slowly due to exhaustive checking."
   - **Explanation**: The nested loops check all combinations of `3*i + 7*j == x` up to `i, j <= 100`, which is inefficient when `x` requires checking a high portion of these combinations before finding a match or concluding no solution.

3. **Invariant 3: Small Values Leading to Large Iterations**  
   - **Natural Language Description**: "For small values of desired chunks that cannot be easily formed using the available portion sizes, the search space is extensively explored, slowing down the program."
   - **Explanation**: Inputs like `x = 1` or `x = 2` (which appear frequently in the slow input) cannot be formed with the given portions, causing the full loop iteration to be executed without early exit.

These invariants highlight how the combination of both a large number of test cases and ineffective search strategies lead to significant slowdowns. To improve the performance, one might consider optimizing the solution, such as using a more efficient algorithm to determine the possibility of representing `x` as a combination of the given portion sizes.

=== Checker Response ===
Let's implement the invariants identified in the previous phase. Here is how you can translate each of the natural language invariants into C++ code snippets:

### Phase 3: Implement Natural Language Invariants in C++

```cpp
void check_test_case_count(int n) {
    // Invariant 1: High Test Case Count
    if (n > 50) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high number of test cases!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_excessive_loop_iterations(int x) {
    // Invariant 2: Inefficient Search Space in Nested Loops
    if (x <= 10) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - inefficient search space for small x!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_inefficient_search_space(int x) {
    // Invariant 3: Small Values Leading to Large Iterations
    if (x < 3 || x == 5) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - small x cannot be formed efficiently!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrate Checkers into Original C++ Program

Now, let's integrate these checks at appropriate locations in the original program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

void check_test_case_count(int n) {
    if (n > 50) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high number of test cases!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_excessive_loop_iterations(int x) {
    if (x <= 10) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - inefficient search space for small x!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_inefficient_search_space(int x) {
    if (x < 3 || x == 5) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - small x cannot be formed efficiently!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    
    // Insert check for high number of test cases
    check_test_case_count(n);
    
    while (n--) {
        int x;
        cin >> x;
        
        // Insert checks related to inefficient computation
        check_excessive_loop_iterations(x);
        check_inefficient_search_space(x);
        
        bool b = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i <= 100; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j <= 100; j++) {
                if (3 * i + 7 * j == x) b = 1;
            }
        }
        
        if (b)
            cout << "YES";
        else
            cout << "NO";
        cout << endl;
    }
}
```

### Explanation

- **`check_test_case_count(int n)`**: This function checks if the number of test cases exceeds 50, which was identified as a threshold where performance may degrade due to the sheer volume of work.

- **`check_excessive_loop_iterations(int x)`**: This check runs before the nested loops when `x` is small (â‰¤10), as small values lead to inefficient exploration of combinations.

- **`check_inefficient_search_space(int x)`**: This check identifies specific small values of `x` that are impossible or difficult to form (below 3 or exactly 5), which require the full loop iteration to conclude.

These checks are placed strategically to prevent them from adding overhead during critical performance sections (like inside the nested loops), while still capturing the performance bottlenecks early.
