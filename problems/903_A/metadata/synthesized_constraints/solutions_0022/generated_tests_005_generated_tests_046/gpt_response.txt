## Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

Based on the given program and hit count information, the following observations can be made:

1. **Nested Loops (Lines 9-10):**
   - The lines containing the nested loops (lines 9 and 10) have significantly higher hit counts in the slow input compared to the fast input.
   - The outer loop runs 100 times for every test case, and for each iteration of the outer loop, the inner loop also runs 100 times. This results in a maximum of 10,000 iterations per test case, which is computationally expensive.

2. **Condition Check (Line 11):**
   - The condition check within the innermost loop (line 11) is executed 470,000 times for the slow input and 20,000 times for the fast input. This suggests that a significant amount of time is spent checking the condition `(3 * i + j * 7) == n`.

3. **Slow Input Characteristics:**
   - The slow input comprises many test cases where the value of `n` is `1`, which requires the nested loops to execute exhaustively to confirm that `1` cannot be represented as any combination of 3 and 7 multiplied by non-negative integers.

## Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the analysis, we can derive the following performance-characterizing invariants:

1. **Invariant 1: High Frequency of Impossible Combinations**
   - Natural Language Description: "If there are many test cases where the desired number of chunks cannot be achieved by any combination of small and large portions, the program may slow down significantly due to exhaustive nested loop execution."
   - This invariant is triggered when the input includes multiple test cases with values for which no valid combinations of the portions exist, such as `n = 1`.

2. **Invariant 2: Large Number of Test Cases with Small Values**
   - Natural Language Description: "When the input consists of a large number of test cases with small values close to minimum allowed sizes, the computation may become inefficient, as the program evaluates all possible combinations without early termination."
   - For example, when `n` is small, especially if it continuously takes values that cannot be expressed as a linear combination of 3 and 7, it leads to inefficient looping.

3. **Invariant 3: Exhaustive Check for Small `n`**
   - Natural Language Description: "If `n` values are repetitively small and specific (e.g., less than or equal to 6), the program will explore all combinations up to 100 iterations unnecessarily, potentially degrading performance."
   - This occurs because, for small values of `n`, the time spent verifying all combinations outweighs the simplicity of determining that some values cannot be represented.

These invariants illustrate the conditions under which the program's execution time increases significantly, primarily focusing on the inefficiencies in the loop logic when dealing with unrepresentable or small values of `n`. Adjustments such as early exits or smarter checks could potentially mitigate these performance bottlenecks.

=== Checker Response ===
Let's begin with Phase 3, where we translate the performance-characterizing invariants into runtime checkers in C++. 

### Phase 3: Implementing Invariants in C++

1. **Invariant 1: High Frequency of Impossible Combinations**

   This invariant checks if the system is evaluating many test cases where the desired number of chunks cannot be formed by any combination of the given portions.

   ```cpp
   void check_high_frequency_of_impossible_combinations(int n) {
       // Check if the number of chunks is one of the problematic small numbers.
       if (n <= 6 && n != 3 && n != 6) {
           cerr << "Warning: High frequency of impossible combinations detected!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Invariant 2: Large Number of Test Cases with Small Values**

   This invariant checks whether we frequently encounter small values that lead to redundant computations.

   ```cpp
   void check_large_number_of_small_test_cases(int m, int n) {
       // If the majority of the test cases are small values, warn.
       if (m > 20 && n <= 6 && n != 3 && n != 6) {
           cerr << "Warning: Large number of small test cases detected!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Invariant 3: Exhaustive Check for Small `n`**

   This checks for small `n` values that could lead to unnecessary exhaustive checks.

   ```cpp
   void check_exhaustive_check_for_small_n(int n) {
       if (n <= 6 && n != 3 && n != 6) {
           cerr << "Warning: Exhaustive check for small `n` detected!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Integrating Checkers into the Original Program

Now, let's integrate these checkers into the original program to help detect the performance bottlenecks.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Function declarations for invariants
void check_high_frequency_of_impossible_combinations(int n) {
    if (n <= 6 && n != 3 && n != 6) {
        cerr << "Warning: High frequency of impossible combinations detected!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_large_number_of_small_test_cases(int m, int n) {
    if (m > 20 && n <= 6 && n != 3 && n != 6) {
        cerr << "Warning: Large number of small test cases detected!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_exhaustive_check_for_small_n(int n) {
    if (n <= 6 && n != 3 && n != 6) {
        cerr << "Warning: Exhaustive check for small `n` detected!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    long long i, j, k, l, m, n;
    cin >> m;

    while (m--) {
        k = 0;
        cin >> n;

        // Check invariants
        check_high_frequency_of_impossible_combinations(n);
        check_large_number_of_small_test_cases(m, n);
        check_exhaustive_check_for_small_n(n);

        for (i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
            for (j = 0; j < 100; j++) {
                if ((3 * i + j * 7) == n) k++;
            }
        }
        if (k > 0)
            cout << "YES" << endl;
        else
            cout << "NO" << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

- **Invariant 1 and 3:** Placed before the nested loops because they can preemptively detect when the computation is redundant or inefficient based on known small values.
- **Invariant 2:** Placed before the loop begins, as it checks the overall pattern of input values in the context of multiple test cases.

These checks help identify conditions under which the program is likely to slow down significantly and alert the user by terminating the execution with an error message.
