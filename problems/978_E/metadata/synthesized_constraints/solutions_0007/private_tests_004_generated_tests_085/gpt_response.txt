### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

By comparing the line-level hit counts for the fast input and the slow input, we see that the primary performance bottleneck occurs at line 14, which is inside a loop that iterates from 0 to `w`. For the slow input, this line's hit count is exceptionally high (1,000,000,002 times), whereas it is only 3 times for the fast input. Similarly, line 15, which contains a conditional check inside this loop, is hit 1,000,000,001 times for the slow input.

### Analysis:

- The loop on line 14 runs from 0 to `w`, and `w` is 1,000,000,000 in the slow input versus only 1 in the fast input.
- This suggests that the loop's range proportional to `w` is a critical factor in the slowdown. Given the input constraints, \( w \) can be as large as \( 10^9 \), making this loop potentially very costly.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the analysis, we can derive the following performance-characterizing invariants in natural language:

1. **High Capacity Range:**
   - Natural Language Description: "If the bus capacity `w` is extremely large, the iteration over potential passenger numbers before the first stop becomes a significant performance bottleneck. The loop's execution time grows linearly with the value of `w`."
   - Threshold Suggestion: Since `w` can range up to \( 10^9 \), any `w` approaching this upper limit will trigger this slow path.

2. **Loop Complexity Due to Large `w`:**
   - Natural Language Description: "When `w` is close to its maximum possible value, the program iterates over a large number of possibilities, causing substantial delay. The performance degrades because the loop iterates over all possible initial numbers of passengers, up to the capacity `w`."
   - Threshold Suggestion: This condition is strongly related to `w` being substantially large, say \( w \geq 10^8 \).

### Summary

These invariants capture the conditions under which the code is likely to enter a slow path: namely, when the bus's capacity `w` is large, thereby resulting in a high number of iterations within the loop that checks possible initial passenger counts. Such conditions could be indicative of potential future slow scenarios, especially when the value of `w` is maximized under the given constraints.

### Phase 3: Implement the Natural Language Invariants in C++

Below are C++ code snippets implementing the performance-characterizing invariants derived in Phase 2. These invariants are translated into runtime checks:

```cpp
// Function to check the high capacity range invariant
void check_high_capacity_range(int w) {
    if (w >= 100000000) { // Threshold for large capacity
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high bus capacity!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

This function checks if the bus capacity `w` is large enough to potentially cause a performance bottleneck due to the loop iterating over all possible initial passenger counts.

### Phase 4: Integrate the Checker Code into the Original Program

Below is the original C++ program with the integrated checker code. The checker is placed after reading the input for `w` to avoid adding overhead inside the loop and to catch potential slow scenarios early.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int n, w;
int arr[1005];
int psum[1005];

// Function to check the high capacity range invariant
void check_high_capacity_range(int w) {
    if (w >= 100000000) { // Threshold for large capacity
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high bus capacity!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    cin >> n >> w;
    
    // Check for potential performance bottleneck due to large capacity
    check_high_capacity_range(w);
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) cin >> arr[i];
    psum[0] = arr[0];
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) psum[i] = arr[i] + psum[i - 1];
    int hi = *max_element(psum, psum + n);
    int lo = *min_element(psum, psum + n);
    int cnt = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i <= w; i++)
        if (i + hi <= w && i + lo >= 0) cnt++;
    cout << cnt;
}
```

### Explanation:

- **Check Placement:** The `check_high_capacity_range` function is called immediately after reading the input values for `n` and `w`. This placement ensures that the program checks for the potential performance bottleneck early in the execution before entering the loop that depends on the value of `w`.

- **Checker Logic:** The check is designed to abort execution if `w` is equal to or greater than 100,000,000. This threshold is chosen based on the invariant analysis, indicating that a high value of `w` can lead to significant performance degradation due to excessive loop iterations.
