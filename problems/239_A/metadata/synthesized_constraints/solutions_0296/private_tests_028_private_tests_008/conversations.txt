system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

Valera had two bags of potatoes, the first of these bags contains x (x ≥ 1) potatoes, and the second — y (y ≥ 1) potatoes. Valera — very scattered boy, so the first bag of potatoes (it contains x potatoes) Valera lost. Valera remembers that the total amount of potatoes (x + y) in the two bags, firstly, was not gerater than n, and, secondly, was divisible by k.

Help Valera to determine how many potatoes could be in the first bag. Print all such possible numbers in ascending order.

Input

The first line of input contains three integers y, k, n (1 ≤ y, k, n ≤ 109; <image> ≤ 105).

Output

Print the list of whitespace-separated integers — all possible values of x in ascending order. You should print each possible value of x exactly once.

If there are no such values of x print a single integer -1.

} /* line 24 slow_hit_count: 1, fast_hit_count: 1 */


assistant: To diagnose the performance bottlenecks in the given C program and derive performance-characterizing invariants, we will analyze the hit count information and the problem constraints.

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Line Analysis**:
   - The critical line is the loop starting at line 10: `for (long long i = 1; i < 100001ll; i++)`. This loop iterates 100,000 times in the slow input case compared to just twice in the fast input case.
   - Within this loop, the condition checks and operations on lines 11-14 are executed 100,000 times for the slow input. These lines are:
     - `s = i * k;` — Calculation of a multiple of `k`.
     - Condition check `if (s > n) break;` — To stop if `s` exceeds `n`.
     - The core logic on lines 13-14: `if (s <= y) continue;` — This check causes the loop to skip further processing, leading to the slow path being triggered.

2. **Reason for Slowdown**:
   - The loop is iterating over a large fixed range (1 to 100,000). For each iteration, it performs checks and potentially skips iterations with the `continue` statement.
   - The number of iterations where the loop skips processing due to `s <= y` is large in the slow input case. As `y` is large in the slow input, this condition is satisfied frequently, causing the loop to continue without adding elements to the vector `ans`.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **Invariant on Loop Iterations**:
   - **Natural Language Description**: "When `y` is large relative to `n`, the loop may iterate many times with minimal useful work done, causing a slowdown. Specifically, when `y` is close to `n` but `n` is not divisible by `k`, the condition `s <= y` results in many skipped iterations."
   - **Abstract Condition**: If `y` is more than half of `n` and `n % k` is small, the program is likely to perform excessive iterations without adding to results.

2. **Invariant on Input Constraints**:
   - **Natural Language Description**: "The performance degrades when `k` is small relative to `n`, leading to more iterations due to increased possible values for `s` that do not satisfy `s <= y`."
   - **Abstract Condition**: When `k` is much less than `n`, but `k` and `n` are such that many multiples of `k` are less than `n` and greater than `y`, the loop runs many iterations.

3. **Invariant on Unproductive Iterations**:
   - **Natural Language Description**: "If the loop iterates over a large range, checking conditions without fulfilling them due to `s <= y`, the execution is inefficient. This often occurs when `y` nearly equals `n` and `n` is slightly larger than a multiple of `k`."
   - **Abstract Condition**: When `y` is close to `n`, and many of `i * k` values fall under `y`, leading to many iterations without useful computation.

These invariants describe conditions under which the performance of the algorithm degrades, focusing on the relationship between `y`, `k`, and `n`, and their effects on loop iterations. Such conditions are crucial to detect and prevent potential slowdowns in similar scenarios.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
Valera had two bags of potatoes, the first of these bags contains x (x ≥ 1) potatoes, and the second — y (y ≥ 1) potatoes. Valera — very scattered boy, so the first bag of potatoes (it contains x potatoes) Valera lost. Valera remembers that the total amount of potatoes (x + y) in the two bags, firstly, was not gerater than n, and, secondly, was divisible by k.

Help Valera to determine how many potatoes could be in the first bag. Print all such possible numbers in ascending order.

Input

The first line of input contains three integers y, k, n (1 ≤ y, k, n ≤ 109; <image> ≤ 105).

Output

Print the list of whitespace-separated integers — all possible values of x in ascending order. You should print each possible value of x exactly once.

If there are no such values of x print a single integer -1.

Solution (C++ code):
{solution}


assistant: Let's translate the performance-characterizing invariants into checker code in C++ and integrate them into the given program. We'll handle this in two phases: implementing the invariant checkers and then integrating these into the original C++ program.

### Phase 3: Implementing Checkers in C++

Based on the performance-characterizing invariants derived earlier, here is how you can implement them in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstdlib>

using namespace std;

// Check if y is too close to n causing inefficient iterations
void check_y_n_invariant(long long y, long long n) {
    if (y > n / 2) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - y is too large compared to n!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Check if k is too small compared to n leading to more iterations
void check_k_n_invariant(long long k, long long n) {
    if (k < n / 1000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - k is too small compared to n!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Check if there are many skipped iterations due to s <= y
void check_skipped_iterations(long long y, long long n, long long k) {
    if (y > n && n % k != 0) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - many iterations skipped due to s <= y!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrating Checkers into the Program

Now, let's integrate these checkers into the original C++ program. We will place the checks after reading inputs and before entering the critical loop, as this will help detect performance issues without adding overhead to the loop itself.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <cstdlib>

using namespace std;

// Invariant checkers as implemented above
void check_y_n_invariant(long long y, long long n) {
    if (y > n / 2) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - y is too large compared to n!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_k_n_invariant(long long k, long long n) {
    if (k < n / 1000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - k is too small compared to n!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_skipped_iterations(long long y, long long n, long long k) {
    if (y > n && n % k != 0) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - many iterations skipped due to s <= y!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    long long y, k, n;
    scanf("%I64d", &y);
    scanf("%I64d", &k);
    scanf("%I64d", &n);

    // Check for potential performance bottlenecks
    check_y_n_invariant(y, n);
    check_k_n_invariant(k, n);
    check_skipped_iterations(y, n, k);

    long long s;
    vector<int> ans;
    for (long long i = 1; i < 100001ll; i++) {
        s = i * k;
        if (s > n) break;
        if (s <= y)
            continue;
        else {
            ans.push_back((int)(s - y));
        }
    }
    if (ans.size() == 0)
        cout << -1;
    else {
        for (int i = 0; i < ans.size(); i++) cout << ans[i] << " ";
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

- **Check Placement**: The checks for potential performance bottlenecks are placed after reading the inputs. This ensures that they are verified before any heavy computation starts.
- **Conditions**: The checks are designed to catch scenarios where the program's performance might degrade, such as when `y` is large relative to `n`, `k` is too small, or many iterations are skipped due to the condition `s <= y`.
- **Abort on Detection**: If any condition indicative of a performance issue is detected, the program outputs a warning message and aborts execution. This helps in debugging and optimizing the program to prevent potential slowdowns in future runs.
