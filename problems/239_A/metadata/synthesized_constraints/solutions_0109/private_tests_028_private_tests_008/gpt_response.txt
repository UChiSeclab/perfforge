=== Invariants Response ===
To analyze the performance bottleneck of the provided C program, we need to identify the code segments that perform inefficiently for the slow input. Based on the hit count information, we can derive performance-characterizing invariants as follows:

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Hit Count Comparison:**
   - The line `for (long long i = 1; i < (n / k) + 1; i++)` (line 28) has significantly more hits for the slow input (`100001` hits) compared to the fast input (`2` hits).
   - The condition `if (i * k > y)` (line 29) is evaluated `100000` times for the slow input but only once for the fast input.

2. **Inference:**
   - The loop is executing a large number of iterations due to the range determined by `n / k`.
   - The condition `i * k > y` checks if the current multiple of `k` is greater than `y`, which is essential for determining valid values of `x`.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the loop's behavior and hit counts, we can derive the following natural language invariants:

1. **Invariant #1: Large Iteration Range**
   - **Description:** The program experiences a slowdown if the range of the loop `(n / k)` is large. This happens when `n` is significantly larger than `k`. Since `n` is divided by `k` to determine the number of iterations, a large ratio results in many loop iterations.
   - **Condition:** "If `n` is much larger than `k` and `y` is small enough such that many multiples of `k` exceed `y`, the loop will execute many times, causing a slowdown."

2. **Invariant #2: Low Filtering by Condition**
   - **Description:** The slowdown is compounded if the condition `i * k > y` rarely filters out iterations. This means most of the iterations result in output, further increasing computational workload.
   - **Condition:** "If most multiples of `k` within the loop range exceed `y`, the program spends more time outputting results, further slowing down execution."

These invariants help characterize the performance issues without relying on specific values from the slow input, focusing instead on the relationships between `y`, `k`, and `n` that lead to inefficiency.

### Phase 3: Implement the Natural Language Invariants in C++

Here, I will translate the natural language performance invariants into C++ code snippets:

1. **Invariant #1: Large Iteration Range**
   
   ```cpp
   void check_large_iteration_range(long long n, long long k) {
       if (n / k > 100000) {  // Arbitrary threshold to detect large iteration range
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large iteration range!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Invariant #2: Low Filtering by Condition**

   ```cpp
   void check_low_filtering_condition(long long n, long long y, long long k) {
       if (y < k && n / k > 1000) {  // Condition where i*k > y rarely filters out iterations
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - low filtering by condition!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Integrate the Checker C++ Code Snippets with the Original Program

Here's the original program with the integrated invariant checks:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
long long mod = 998244353;

inline long long add(long long x, long long y) {
  x += y;
  if (x >= mod) x -= mod;
  return x;
}

inline long long sub(long long x, long long y) {
  x -= y;
  if (x < 0) x += mod;
  return x;
}

inline long long mul(long long x, long long y) { return (x * y) % mod; }

inline long long powr(long long a, long long b) {
  long long x = 1 % mod;
  while (b) {
    if (b & 1) x = mul(x, a);
    a = mul(a, a);
    b >>= 1;
  }
  return x;
}

inline long long inv(long long a) { return powr(a, mod - 2); }

// Performance checkers
void check_large_iteration_range(long long n, long long k) {
    if (n / k > 100000) {  // Arbitrary threshold to detect large iteration range
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large iteration range!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_low_filtering_condition(long long n, long long y, long long k) {
    if (y < k && n / k > 1000) {  // Condition where i*k > y rarely filters out iterations
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - low filtering by condition!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void solve() {
  long long y, n, k, fg = 1;
  cin >> y >> k >> n;

  // Check for performance conditions
  check_large_iteration_range(n, k);
  check_low_filtering_condition(n, y, k);

  for (long long i = 1; i < (n / k) + 1; i++) {
    if (i * k > y) {
      fg = 0;
      cout << i * k - y << " ";
    }
  }

  if (fg) cout << "-1";
  return;
}

signed main() {
  long long t = 1;
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(nullptr);
  cout.tie(nullptr);
  while (t--) {
    solve();
  }
  return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

1. **`check_large_iteration_range`:** This check is added right after reading `n` and `k` to ensure that the loop's iteration range doesn't become excessively large, which could cause a performance bottleneck.

2. **`check_low_filtering_condition`:** This check is also added after reading inputs to verify that the loop's filtering condition (`i * k > y`) doesn't become ineffective, leading to unnecessary iterations. 

These checks help in identifying situations where the program might face performance issues, allowing a fuzzer to detect potential slowdowns.
