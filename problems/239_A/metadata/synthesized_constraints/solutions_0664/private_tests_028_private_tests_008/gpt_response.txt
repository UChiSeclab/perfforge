=== Invariants Response ===
To analyze the performance bottlenecks in the provided C++ code and derive performance-characterizing invariants, let's go through the tasks outlined in the problem statement.

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Compare Line-level Hit Counts**: 
   - The `for` loop on line 9 has a significant disparity in hit counts between the slow and fast inputs. It is hit 100,001 times with the slow input, compared to just 2 times with the fast input.
   - The `if` condition inside the loop on line 10 is hit frequently (100,000 times) when running the slow input, which suggests this loop is a major contributor to the performance degradation.

2. **Pinpointing Lines or Functions**:
   - The loop from `m - y` to `n - y`, stepping by `m`, is the critical section of the code, especially when `m - y` is much smaller than `n - y`. This causes the loop to iterate a large number of times.

3. **Inference Regarding Data Structures and Loops**:
   - The code uses a loop to find numbers `i` such that `(i + y) % m == 0` and `i > 0`. As `n` and `y` are large, and `m` is small (1 in this case), the loop covers a wide range with many iterations.
   - Since `n` is large and `m` is small compared to `y`, the loop performs excessive iterations without any substantial early exit.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **Natural Language Performance Invariants**:
   - **Invariant 1**: When the difference between `n` and `y` is large and `m` is small, the loop iterates excessively, leading to increased execution time.
   - **Invariant 2**: If `m` is significantly smaller than `y` and `n`, the condition `(i + y) % m == 0` results in a high number of checks over an extensive range, slowing the computation.
   - **Invariant 3**: Performance degradation occurs when the lower bound of the loop (`m - y`) is much less than the upper bound (`n - y`), causing the loop to execute many times without early termination.

2. **Avoiding Exact Numeric Dependencies**:
   - The above invariants abstractly describe scenarios that lead to increased computational time without relying on specific numeric values from the slow input. They use relational descriptions (e.g., "difference between `n` and `y` is large") instead.

3. **Correlation with Input Patterns**:
   - These invariants correlate strongly with input patterns where `n` is at its maximum or near its maximum constraint (e.g., close to `10^9`), `y` is large, and `m` is small, as demonstrated by the slow input.

4. **Broad but Realistic Triggers**:
   - The statements capture realistic triggers for slow performance by considering how input values relate to each other, such as `n - y` and the stepping interval `m`.

### Conclusion

By identifying the critical loop and understanding how the input parameters interact, we've derived natural language performance invariants that highlight conditions causing the program to slow down. These invariants should help guide optimizations or aid fuzzer tools in identifying similar slow-performance scenarios in the future.

=== Checker Response ===
Let's implement the natural language invariants derived earlier into C++ code checks.

### Phase 3: Implement the Natural Language Invariants in C++

Here are the natural language invariants translated into C++ checker code:

1. **Invariant 1**: When the difference between `n` and `y` is large and `m` (equivalent to `k` in the original problem statement) is small, the loop iterates excessively, leading to increased execution time.

```cpp
void check_large_range_small_step_invariant(int y, int m, int n) {
    if ((n - y) / m > 100000) {  // This threshold is chosen as a proxy for excessive iterations
        cerr << "Warning: large_range_small_step_invariant triggered - excessive loop iterations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

2. **Invariant 2**: If `m` is significantly smaller than `y` and `n`, the condition `(i + y) % m == 0` results in a high number of checks over an extensive range, slowing the computation.

```cpp
void check_small_m_invariant(int y, int m, int n) {
    if (m < 10 && n > 100000 && y > 100000) {  // Arbitrary but reasonable threshold
        cerr << "Warning: small_m_invariant triggered - m is very small compared to n and y" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

3. **Invariant 3**: Performance degradation occurs when the lower bound of the loop (`m - y`) is much less than the upper bound (`n - y`), causing the loop to execute many times without early termination.

```cpp
void check_large_diff_invariant(int y, int m, int n) {
    if ((n - y) - (m - y) > 1000000) {  // Another threshold indicating excessive iterations
        cerr << "Warning: large_diff_invariant triggered - large loop range" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrate Checker Code with the Original Program

Now, let's integrate these checks into the original C++ program.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Checkers for performance invariants
void check_large_range_small_step_invariant(int y, int m, int n) {
    if ((n - y) / m > 100000) {
        cerr << "Warning: large_range_small_step_invariant triggered - excessive loop iterations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_small_m_invariant(int y, int m, int n) {
    if (m < 10 && n > 100000 && y > 100000) {
        cerr << "Warning: small_m_invariant triggered - m is very small compared to n and y" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_large_diff_invariant(int y, int m, int n) {
    if ((n - y) - (m - y) > 1000000) {
        cerr << "Warning: large_diff_invariant triggered - large loop range" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    int y, m, n;
    cin >> y >> m >> n;

    // Insert checks after input to catch problematic configurations early
    check_large_range_small_step_invariant(y, m, n);
    check_small_m_invariant(y, m, n);
    check_large_diff_invariant(y, m, n);

    vector<int> a;
    for (int i = m - y; i <= n - y; i += m) {
        if ((i + y) % m == 0 && i > 0) {
            a.push_back(i);
        }
    }

    if (a.empty()) {
        cout << -1 << endl;
    } else {
        for (int i = 0; i < a.size(); i++) cout << a[i] << " ";
    }
}
```

### Explanation

- **Integration**: Each of the checks is placed right after reading the input, which prevents entering the main loop if conditions that could lead to performance degradation are met.
- **Checks**: The checks help identify potentially problematic input configurations quickly, providing immediate feedback if the program is likely to slow down due to such inputs. These are not hardcoded to specific values from the slow input but are instead based on general conditions derived from the problem context.
- **Abort on Trigger**: When any condition is met, the program will abort with a descriptive warning message to help diagnose the issue.
