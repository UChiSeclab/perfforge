=== Invariants Response ===
To analyze the given code and derive performance-characterizing invariants, let's go through the provided details and code.

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Compare Line-Level Hit Counts:**
   - The line with the most significant hit count difference between the slow and fast input is line 7:
     - **Slow Input:** `while (k - y <= 0) k += ki;` hit 1,000,000,001 times.
     - **Fast Input:** hit 11 times.

2. **Pinpoint Lines or Functions with More Hits:**
   - The line `while (k - y <= 0) k += ki;` inside the main function gets significantly more hits in the slow input compared to the fast one.
   - This line is responsible for adjusting the value of `k` to ensure `(x + y)` is a valid number that fulfills the constraints provided.

3. **Interaction with Data Structures and Conditions:**
   - This loop continually increments `k` by `ki` until `k - y > 0`. The increment is based on the value of `k`, which heavily relies on the input values provided for `y` and `k`.
   - If `k` is initially less than or equal to `y`, as in the slow input, this loop iterates excessively, resulting in a large number of operations.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the above analysis, let's derive natural language invariants that explain when the program slows down:

1. **Invariant 1: Large Initial Difference Between `k` and `y`**
   - **Natural Language Statement:** "If the initial value of `k` is much less than the value of `y`, the program will spend excessive time adjusting `k` to make `k - y > 0`, especially when `k` is small relative to `y`."

2. **Invariant 2: High Iteration in Adjustment Loop**
   - **Natural Language Statement:** "When `k` is initially smaller than or equal to `y`, and the difference is large, the loop to adjust `k` might run a high number of times, leading to slow execution. This is particularly noticeable if the ratio of `y` to `k` is significant."

### Output Requirements: Performance Invariants 

Based on the above conditions, here is the concise set of natural language statements:

1. **Performance Invariant 1:**
   - "The program may experience significant slowdown when the difference between `y` and `k` is large, requiring substantial iterations to adjust `k` such that `k - y` becomes positive."

2. **Performance Invariant 2:**
   - "If `y` is substantially larger than `k`, the adjustment loop iterates excessively to satisfy the condition, which is a potential cause of slowdown."

These statements abstractly describe the condition that leads to the slow execution path without relying on specific numeric values from the input, while still considering the problem constraints where `1 ≤ y, k, n ≤ 10^9`.

=== Checker Response ===
### Phase 3: Implement Invariants as Checker Code in C++

Based on the performance-characterizing invariants derived earlier, we will implement checker code to detect conditions that may lead to slow execution.

**Invariant 1: Large Initial Difference Between `k` and `y`**
- Natural Language: "If the initial value of `k` is much less than the value of `y`, the program will spend excessive time adjusting `k` to make `k - y > 0`, especially when `k` is small relative to `y`."

**Invariant 2: High Iteration in Adjustment Loop**
- Natural Language: "When `k` is initially smaller than or equal to `y`, and the difference is large, the loop to adjust `k` might run a high number of times, leading to slow execution. This is particularly noticeable if the ratio of `y` to `k` is significant."

Here is the C++ code implementing these invariants:

```cpp
void check_large_difference_invariant(int k, int y) {
    if (k <= y) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large initial difference between k and y!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_high_iteration_invariant(int k, int y) {
    if (y > 1000000 * k) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high number of iterations due to y being much larger than k!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrate Checker Code into Original Program

Now, let's integrate the checker code into the original C++ program, ensuring the checks are placed at effective points in control flow without adding overhead in tight loops.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Checker functions implementing performance-characterizing invariants
void check_large_difference_invariant(int k, int y) {
    if (k <= y) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large initial difference between k and y!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_high_iteration_invariant(int k, int y) {
    if (y > 1000000 * k) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high number of iterations due to y being much larger than k!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    int x, y, n, k, ki;
    cin >> y >> k >> n;

    // Check for potential performance bottlenecks
    check_large_difference_invariant(k, y);
    check_high_iteration_invariant(k, y);

    ki = k;
    while (k - y <= 0) k += ki;
    x = k - y;
    if (x + y > n) {
        cout << "-1" << endl;
        return 0;
    }
    while (x + y <= n) {
        cout << x << " ";
        k += ki;
        x = k - y;
    }
    cout << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation of Integrated Code:**
- **Checking Conditions:** The checker functions are called immediately after reading the input values. This ensures that any potential performance bottlenecks are detected early.
- **Avoiding Overhead:** The checks are placed outside of the main processing loops to prevent additional overhead during execution, especially in performance-critical sections of the code.
- **Fuzzer Utility:** The added checks will help in detecting slow performance triggers during testing or fuzzing by aborting execution with a clear warning message when conditions are met.
