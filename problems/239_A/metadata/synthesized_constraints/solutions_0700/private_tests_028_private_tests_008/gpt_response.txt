### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Line-Level Hit Count Analysis:**
   - **Line 14:** The `for` loop runs `n/k + 1` times, which results in 100,002 iterations for the slow input, compared to only 3 iterations for the fast input. The loop's high hit count is an indicator of a performance bottleneck.
   - **Line 15 and Line 16:** These lines are executed once per loop iteration, indicating that the loop's logic (including conditional checks) is being repeatedly evaluated, contributing significantly to the slowdown.

2. **Interaction with Data Structures:**
   - The loop aims to compute multiples of `k` and check these against `y`. For each valid multiple, it computes and stores `num - y` in a vector. This process involves numerous iterations and potential memory operations, impacting performance with larger values of `n`.

3. **Recursion, Loops, and Constraints:**
   - The loop iterates over a range defined by the quotient `n/k`, meaning the larger the `n` relative to `k`, the more iterations occur. This is exacerbated when `n` is at its constraint limit (close to 1 billion).

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **Invariants and Conditions:**
   - **Invariant 1: High Iteration Count**
     - Natural language description: "When `n` is significantly larger than `k`, the loop iterates many times, leading to a slowdown. This is especially true when the quotient `n/k` is large."
   - **Invariant 2: Loop Operation Intensity**
     - Natural language description: "If the loop repeatedly checks and calculates multiples for a high value of `n` relative to `k`, performance is impacted due to excessive iteration and condition evaluation."
   - **Invariant 3: Memory and Vector Usage**
     - Natural language description: "While the vector `ans` is populated only when `num` is greater than `y`, a large `n` can still lead to numerous conditional checks and potential memory operations, affecting performance."

2. **Threshold Considerations:**
   - The performance slows down substantially when the ratio `n/k` approaches upper limits allowed by constraints, leading to excessive iterations in the loop.
   - The code is efficient for smaller ratios of `n/k`, thereby minimizing the number of times lines 15 and 16 are executed.

3. **Generalized Performance Triggers:**
   - These invariants highlight that performance issues arise primarily due to the loop's extensive iteration count when `n` is large and `k` is small, relative to the maximum constraint.

### Conclusion

The main performance bottleneck is the extensive iteration in the loop when `n` is large, resulting in the loop being run a significant number of times. The natural language invariants suggest that ensuring `n` is not excessively large relative to `k` will keep the loop iteration count manageable, preventing slow execution.

### Phase 3: Implement the Natural Language Invariants in C++

Based on the performance-characterizing invariants identified in Phase 2, here's C++ code to check those conditions at runtime:

#### Invariant 1: High Iteration Count
When `n` is significantly larger than `k`, the loop iterates many times, leading to a slowdown.

```cpp
void check_iteration_invariant(int n, int k) {
    if (n / k > 100000) {  // Arbitrary threshold based on constraints and analysis
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive loop iterations due to high n/k ratio!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

#### Invariant 2: Loop Operation Intensity
If the loop repeatedly checks and calculates multiples for a high value of `n` relative to `k`, performance is impacted due to excessive iteration and condition evaluation.

```cpp
void check_loop_intensity_invariant(int n, int k, int y) {
    if (n / k > 100000 && y < k) {  // Combining conditions to check for intense loop operation
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high loop intensity due to n/k ratio and low y!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrate the Checker Code into the Original Program

Here's the original C++ program integrated with the invariant checks:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Check for excessive loop iterations based on n/k ratio
void check_iteration_invariant(int n, int k) {
    if (n / k > 100000) {  // Arbitrary threshold based on constraints and analysis
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive loop iterations due to high n/k ratio!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Check for intense loop operations due to high n/k ratio and low y
void check_loop_intensity_invariant(int n, int k, int y) {
    if (n / k > 100000 && y < k) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high loop intensity due to n/k ratio and low y!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    int y, k, n;
    cin >> y >> k >> n;

    // Insert checks after reading inputs
    check_iteration_invariant(n, k);
    check_loop_intensity_invariant(n, k, y);

    vector<int> ans;
    for (int i = 0; i <= n / k; i++) {  // Loop susceptible to performance issues
        int num = i * k;
        if (num <= y) continue;
        ans.push_back(num - y);
    }
    if ((int)ans.size() == 0)
        cout << -1 << endl;
    else {
        for (int x : ans) cout << x << ' ';
        cout << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

- **Invariant Checks:** The checks are inserted right after reading the input values. This ensures that the program exits early if it detects a potential performance issue, avoiding the computational cost of executing the problematic loop.

- **Placement:** The checks are placed before the for-loop to avoid impacting performance further by placing checks inside the loop.

- **Thresholds:** The arbitrary threshold of `100,000` for `n/k` ratio is based on observed performance degradation and the problem's constraints. This threshold should be adjusted based on empirical testing and more precise performance profiling if necessary.

This integration of checker functions helps identify performance bottlenecks during execution, especially useful when testing with a fuzzer to detect slow input scenarios.
