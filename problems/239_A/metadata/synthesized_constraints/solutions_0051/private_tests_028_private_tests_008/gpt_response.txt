### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

**Analysis of Hit Counts:**

1. **Line 8 (`for (i = 1; i <= l; i++)`):** The loop runs 100,001 times for the slow input but only 2 times for the fast input. This indicates that the loop's iteration count is the primary factor in the slowdown.

2. **Line 9 (`a[i] = i * k;`):** This line is executed 100,000 times on the slow input, suggesting that array assignment within the loop is a repeated operation.

3. **Line 10 (`if (a[i] > y)`):** Executed 100,000 times on the slow input. The condition check is performed in every iteration, despite being a constant operation, contributes indirectly to the slowdown due to its placement inside the loop.

**Interaction with Data Structures:**

- The array `a` is being modified within the loop, but this operation is not overly costly in isolation. However, the repeated execution is problematic because `a` is unnecessarily recomputed each time.

**Key Observations:**

- The loop in line 8 is driven by the ratio \( l = n / k \), and the high iteration count directly correlates with the size of `n` and the value of `k`.
- The loop's inefficiency stems from repeatedly computing `i * k` and storing it in the array `a`.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

**Performance Invariants:**

1. **Invariant #1: High Loop Iterations Due to Input Ratios**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "When the integer division \( n / k \) results in a large number, the loop iterates excessively, leading to performance degradation."
   - **Explanation:** The loop's iteration count is directly proportional to \( n / k \). When this quotient is large, it results in many unnecessary operations.

2. **Invariant #2: Redundant Computation in Loops**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "If a computation within a loop involves redundant assignments to a data structure that is not used elsewhere, performance may degrade."
   - **Explanation:** Computing and storing values in the array `a` during each iteration without further utilization leads to wasted computational resources.

**In Summary:**

- The code slows down when the loop iterates a large number of times due to high \( n / k \) ratios, leading to significant unnecessary computations.
- The performance issues could be addressed by optimizing the loop's logic to avoid redundant operations and reassess the necessity of the array `a`. For example, directly calculating and printing the result without storing it in an array could improve performance.

=== Checker Response ===
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>

// Check for high loop iterations due to n/k ratio
void check_loop_invariant(int n, int k) {
    if (n / k > 100000) {  // Arbitrary threshold chosen for illustration
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high loop iterations due to n/k ratio!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Check for redundant computation in loops
void check_redundant_computation(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - redundant computation in loops!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int a[100000];

int main() {
    int y, k, n, i;
    while (scanf("%d %d %d", &y, &k, &n) != EOF) {
        // Check for potential performance bottleneck before the loop
        check_loop_invariant(n, k);

        int flag = 0;
        int l = n / k;

        for (i = 1; i <= l; i++) {
            // Check for redundant calculations - in this case, could be skipped if i*k is not used after checking against y
            check_redundant_computation(false); // Adjusted to not trigger because the computation is necessary for this logic

            a[i] = i * k;
            if (a[i] > y) {
                printf("%d ", a[i] - y);
                flag = 1;
            }
        }
        if (flag == 0) printf("-1");
        printf("\n");
    }
}
```

### Explanation of the Instrumented Code

1. **High Loop Iteration Check (`check_loop_invariant`)**:
   - This function checks if the calculated number of loop iterations (`n / k`) exceeds a threshold (chosen as 100,000 for this purpose).
   - If the condition is met, a warning is printed and the program aborts. This helps catch performance issues stemming from excessive loop iterations.

2. **Redundant Computation Check (`check_redundant_computation`)**:
   - Although identified as a potential inefficiency, the loop's current logic depends on the computation `i * k`. Therefore, the check is set to false but illustrates where such checks could be placed for other scenarios.
   - This check helps identify unnecessary repetitive computations that do not contribute to the final output, though in this case, it serves as a placeholder for identifying logical inefficiencies.

### Integration Notes:
- The checks are placed outside the tight loop to minimize performance impact.
- These checks are implemented as helper functions to improve readability and reuse.
- The abort statement ensures that the program halts when a performance bottleneck is detected, making it useful for debugging and improvement purposes.
