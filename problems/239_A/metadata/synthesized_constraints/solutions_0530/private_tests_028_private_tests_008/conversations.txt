system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

Valera had two bags of potatoes, the first of these bags contains x (x ≥ 1) potatoes, and the second — y (y ≥ 1) potatoes. Valera — very scattered boy, so the first bag of potatoes (it contains x potatoes) Valera lost. Valera remembers that the total amount of potatoes (x + y) in the two bags, firstly, was not gerater than n, and, secondly, was divisible by k.

Help Valera to determine how many potatoes could be in the first bag. Print all such possible numbers in ascending order.

Input

The first line of input contains three integers y, k, n (1 ≤ y, k, n ≤ 109; <image> ≤ 105).

Output

Print the list of whitespace-separated integers — all possible values of x in ascending order. You should print each possible value of x exactly once.

If there are no such values of x print a single integer -1.

assistant: To analyze the given C code and identify the performance bottlenecks, let's go through the steps:

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Compare Line-Level Hit Counts**:
   - **Line 10 (`while (k * i <= n)`)**: This loop is executed 100,001 times for the slow input and only 2 times for the fast input.
   - **Line 11 (`if (y == n)`)**: This check is performed 100,000 times for the slow input and once for the fast input.
   - **Line 13 (`else if (k * i > y)`)**: This condition is checked 100,000 times for the slow input and once for the fast input.
   - **Line 17 (`i++`)**: The increment operation is executed 100,000 times for the slow input and once for the fast input.

2. **Inference**:
   - The main performance bottleneck is the loop starting at line 10. The loop iterates from `i = 1` to a point where `k * i > n`, incrementing `i` and performing several checks.
   - For the slow input, the value of `n` is significantly larger than `k`, leading to a high number of iterations.
   - The conditional checks within the loop (lines 11 and 13) do not significantly reduce the number of iterations, especially when `y` is significantly larger than `k`.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the above analysis, we can generate natural language statements that describe the conditions leading to the slow path:

1. **Invariant 1: Large Difference Between `n` and `k`**:
   - "If the value of `n` is significantly larger than `k`, the loop in the program runs many times, leading to slow performance."
   - **Explanation**: When `n` is much larger than `k`, the loop iterates extensively, causing a slowdown.

2. **Invariant 2: Inefficient Loop When `y` is Small**:
   - "If `y` is small compared to `n` and `k`, the loop iterates many times without printing any valid results, as most `k * i` values are greater than `y`."
   - **Explanation**: A smaller `y` means the condition `k * i > y` becomes true more often, but without reaching the printing condition quickly.

3. **Invariant 3: Loop Iterations Reaching Upper Bound**:
   - "If `k` divides `n` but does not divide a substantial part of the range before `y`, the loop performs many unnecessary checks."
   - **Explanation**: If `k` divides `n` perfectly, but it skips many potential `x` values less than or equal to `y`, the loop iterates without finding valid results.

These invariants capture the scenarios where the loop performs excessively many iterations due to the relationships between `n`, `k`, and `y`. They help in understanding when the loop becomes a performance bottleneck by focusing on the structural conditions of the input.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp

    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
Valera had two bags of potatoes, the first of these bags contains x (x ≥ 1) potatoes, and the second — y (y ≥ 1) potatoes. Valera — very scattered boy, so the first bag of potatoes (it contains x potatoes) Valera lost. Valera remembers that the total amount of potatoes (x + y) in the two bags, firstly, was not gerater than n, and, secondly, was divisible by k.

Help Valera to determine how many potatoes could be in the first bag. Print all such possible numbers in ascending order.

Input

The first line of input contains three integers y, k, n (1 ≤ y, k, n ≤ 109; <image> ≤ 105).

Output

Print the list of whitespace-separated integers — all possible values of x in ascending order. You should print each possible value of x exactly once.

If there are no such values of x print a single integer -1.

Solution (C++ code):
{solution}


assistant: ### Phase 3: Implement the Natural Language Invariants in C++

Based on the natural language invariants derived earlier, here are the C++ code snippets to check each condition at runtime:

1. **Invariant 1: Large Difference Between `n` and `k`**
   ```cpp
   void check_large_difference_invariant(long long k, long long n) {
       if (n > 100 * k) { // Assuming a threshold of 100 times larger
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to large n compared to k!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Invariant 2: Inefficient Loop When `y` is Small**
   ```cpp
   void check_small_y_invariant(long long y, long long n, long long k) {
       if (y < k && n > y) { // Small y compared to n and k
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to small y!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Invariant 3: Loop Iterations Reaching Upper Bound**
   ```cpp
   void check_k_divides_n_invariant(long long n, long long k, long long y) {
       if ((n % k == 0) && (y < n / 2)) { // Checks if k divides n and y is relatively small
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to k dividing n perfectly!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Instrument the Original Program with Checkers

Now, integrate these checks into the existing C++ program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Checker functions
void check_large_difference_invariant(long long k, long long n) {
    if (n > 100 * k) { // Assuming a threshold of 100 times larger
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to large n compared to k!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_small_y_invariant(long long y, long long n, long long k) {
    if (y < k && n > y) { // Small y compared to n and k
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to small y!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_k_divides_n_invariant(long long n, long long k, long long y) {
    if ((n % k == 0) && (y < n / 2)) { // Checks if k divides n and y is relatively small
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to k dividing n perfectly!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);

    long long y, k, n;
    cin >> y >> k >> n;

    // Run the performance checks
    check_large_difference_invariant(k, n);
    check_small_y_invariant(y, n, k);
    check_k_divides_n_invariant(n, k, y);

    bool flag = true;
    long long i = 1;
    while (k * i <= n) {
        if (y == n)
            break;
        else if (k * i > y) {
            cout << k * i - y << " ";
            flag = false;
        }
        i++;
    }
    if (flag) cout << -1;
}
```

### Explanation

- **Placement of Checks**: The checks are placed after reading the input values and before the main loop to ensure no unnecessary overhead is added by placing them within the loop.
- **Flexibility**: The checks use estimated thresholds based on the problem description to help identify conditions where performance might degrade, aiming for a balance between catching potential issues and avoiding false positives.
- **Usefulness for Fuzzers**: These conditions can help a fuzzer trigger slow performance paths, potentially identifying further areas for optimization.
