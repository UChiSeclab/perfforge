=== Invariants Response ===
Here's an analysis and explanation of what causes the slowdown in the given C program:

**Phase 1: Identify expensive or inefficient code segments**

1. **Comparison of Line-Level Hit Counts:**
   - The function `f(long long n)` is called recursively.
   - Lines 4 and 7, which are related to the recursive calls, have significantly higher hit counts for the slow input compared to the fast input.

2. **Pinpointing Lines with High Hit Counts:**
   - **Line 4:** `long long f(long long n)` - This line is the entry for the recursive function and indicates the number of times `f` is called. The hit count for the slow input (21891) is vastly higher than for the fast input (3).
   - **Line 7:** `return f(n - 1) + f(n - 2);` - This line indicates recursive calls to `f`. For the slow input, the hit count is 10945, compared to 1 for the fast input.

3. **Interaction Analysis:**
   - The recursion depth and branching factor are high for the slow input (n = 20), leading to a large number of recursive calls.
   - This results in exponential growth of recursive calls due to the nature of the Fibonacci-like computation, where each call to `f` generates two more calls unless `n` reaches 0 or 1.

**Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language)**

1. **Exponential Growth due to Recursion:**
   - **Invariant:** "When `n` is large, close to the upper constraint of 20, the recursive Fibonacci-like function incurs exponential growth in function calls, leading to significant slowdown."

2. **Depth of Recursion:**
   - **Invariant:** "The function's performance degrades when recursion depth approaches the maximum allowed input value, as each level of recursion multiplies the number of calls exponentially."

3. **Branching Factor and Recursive Calls:**
   - **Invariant:** "The branching factor in the recursive function causes an exponential increase in calls as `n` increases, making the computation expensive when `n` is at the higher end of the allowed range."

These invariants highlight that the main performance bottleneck is due to the recursive nature of the function, which results in exponential growth in recursive calls as `n` approaches its upper limit. This is typical for naive recursive implementations of the Fibonacci sequence without memoization or dynamic programming techniques.

=== Checker Response ===
Let's proceed first with Phase 3, where we will implement the natural language invariants from Phase 2 in C++ checker code.

### Phase 3: Implementing Checkers in C++

Here are the C++ checkers for the performance-characterizing invariants:

1. **Exponential Growth due to Recursion:**

```cpp
void check_exponential_growth_invariant(int n) {
    if (n > 15) { // Threshold based on recursion depth
        cerr << "Warning: Exponential recursion growth condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

2. **Depth of Recursion:**

```cpp
void check_recursion_depth_invariant(int n) {
    if (n > 15) { // Threshold based on recursion depth
        cerr << "Warning: Recursion depth condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

3. **Branching Factor and Recursive Calls:**

```cpp
void check_branching_factor_invariant(int n) {
    if (n > 15) { // Threshold for branching factor leading to exponential calls
        cerr << "Warning: High branching factor condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrating Checkers with the Original Program

Now, let's integrate these checkers into the original C++ program.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

long long a, b;

// Checkers for performance-characterizing invariants
void check_exponential_growth_invariant(int n) {
    if (n > 15) { // Threshold based on recursion depth
        cerr << "Warning: Exponential recursion growth condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_recursion_depth_invariant(int n) {
    if (n > 15) { // Threshold based on recursion depth
        cerr << "Warning: Recursion depth condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_branching_factor_invariant(int n) {
    if (n > 15) { // Threshold for branching factor leading to exponential calls
        cerr << "Warning: High branching factor condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

long long f(long long n) {
    if (n == 0) return a;
    if (n == 1) return b;
    return f(n - 1) + f(n - 2);
}

int main() {
    long long n;
    cin >> a >> b;
    cin >> n;
    
    // Check for conditions that may lead to performance bottlenecks.
    check_exponential_growth_invariant(n);
    check_recursion_depth_invariant(n);
    check_branching_factor_invariant(n);

    cout << f(n);
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

- **Placement of Checks:** The checks are placed after reading the input and before invoking the recursive function `f`. This ensures that we catch potential slow paths without introducing extra overhead within the recursive calls.
  
- **Integration with Original Logic:** The checkers are called with the input `n` to detect if the conditions for slow performance are likely to be met based on the input value.

- **Thresholds:** The threshold (`n > 15`) is based on the fact that for higher values, recursion leads to an exponential number of calls, causing slow performance. This is a heuristic chosen given the constraints (1 ≤ n ≤ 20).
