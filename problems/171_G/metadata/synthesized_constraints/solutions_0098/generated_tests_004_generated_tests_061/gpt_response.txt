## Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

Upon examining the provided hit counts for both the slow and fast inputs, the following observations can be made:

1. **High Recursion Depth**: The function `f` at line 3 is called 21,891 times for the slow input compared to only 3 times for the fast input. This indicates that the recursive calls are the primary contributors to the slowdown.

2. **Conditional Checks**:
   - Line 4 (`if (n == 0)`) and line 6 (`else if (n == 1)`) are hit frequently in the slow input. This suggests that the base cases are essential to terminating recursion, and with a high value of `n`, the recursion depth increases significantly.

3. **Recursive Calls**: Line 8 (`return f(n1, n2, n - 1) + f(n1, n2, n - 2)`) is called 10,945 times in the slow input. This line represents the Fibonacci-like recursive structure, causing exponential growth in the number of function calls.

## Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the analysis above, the following natural language performance invariants can be derived:

### Invariant 1: Deep Recursion Due to Large `n`

- **Natural Language Description**: "When the third input integer `n` is large, especially near the upper constraint limit (e.g., close to 20), the recursive function calls increase exponentially, leading to significant slowdowns."
  
  - This invariant identifies that as `n` approaches its maximum allowed value, the recursive nature of the function `f` leads to a large number of redundant calculations, causing performance degradation.

### Invariant 2: Exponential Growth in Computation

- **Natural Language Description**: "The recursive calls exhibit exponential growth as `n` increases, particularly when `n` is much larger than in typical cases, causing an explosion in the number of function evaluations."

  - This invariant highlights that the Fibonacci-like nature of the recursion results in an exponential number of calls, which is computationally expensive.

### Invariant 3: Inefficient Base Case Handling

- **Natural Language Description**: "If the base cases for the recursive function are repeatedly checked due to high recursion levels, this indicates excessive unnecessary computations, contributing to slow performance."

  - This invariant stresses the repeated evaluation of base cases when `n` is large, which, although necessary for correctness, is inefficient for performance.

### Important Note:

These invariants are designed to capture broad conditions indicative of slow performance. They do not rely on exact numeric values from the slow input but instead consider the problem constraints and typical behavior patterns of recursive algorithms.

## Phase 3: Implement Performance-Characterizing Invariants in C++

### Invariant 1: Deep Recursion Due to Large `n`
```cpp
void check_deep_recursion_invariant(int n) {
    if (n >= 15) { // Assuming large n as a threshold for recursion depth
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - deep recursion due to large n" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Invariant 2: Exponential Growth in Computation
```cpp
void check_exponential_growth_invariant(int n) {
    if (n > 10) { // Threshold chosen based on exponential growth behavior
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - exponential growth in recursion" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Invariant 3: Inefficient Base Case Handling
```cpp
void check_base_case_handling_invariant(int n) {
    if (n > 12) { // Threshold where base case handling becomes inefficient
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - inefficient base case handling" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

## Phase 4: Integrate Checker Code into the Original Program

Below is the final C++ program with the integrated runtime checks for performance bottlenecks:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Check for deep recursion due to large `n`
void check_deep_recursion_invariant(int n) {
    if (n >= 15) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - deep recursion due to large n" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Check for exponential growth in computation
void check_exponential_growth_invariant(int n) {
    if (n > 10) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - exponential growth in recursion" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Check for inefficient base case handling
void check_base_case_handling_invariant(int n) {
    if (n > 12) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - inefficient base case handling" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int f(int n1, int n2, int n) {
    if (n == 0)
        return n1;
    else if (n == 1)
        return n2;
    return f(n1, n2, n - 1) + f(n1, n2, n - 2);
}

int main() {
    int n1, n2, n;
    cin >> n1 >> n2 >> n;

    // Inserted checks to detect potential performance bottlenecks
    check_deep_recursion_invariant(n);
    check_exponential_growth_invariant(n);
    check_base_case_handling_invariant(n);

    cout << f(n1, n2, n);
}
```

### Explanation:

- **Placement of Checks**: The checks are placed immediately after reading the input values. This ensures that any potentially problematic input is flagged before the expensive recursive calls begin.
- **Thresholds**: Reasonable thresholds are chosen based on the observed performance patterns and constraints (e.g., `n <= 20`). These thresholds help in identifying when the computation may become inefficient due to recursion depth or exponential call growth.
