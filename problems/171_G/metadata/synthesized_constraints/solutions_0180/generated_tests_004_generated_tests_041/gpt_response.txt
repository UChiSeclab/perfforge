=== Invariants Response ===
Let's analyze the program and derive performance-characterizing invariants based on the given information.

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Comparing Hit Counts**:
   - The function `f(int n)` has significantly higher hit counts for the slow input compared to the fast input. Specifically:
     - Function `f` is hit 21,891 times for the slow input and only once for the fast input.
     - Lines involving recursive calls (`lines 5, 6, and 7`) are repeatedly executed for the slow input.

2. **Analysis of Recursive Function**:
   - The recursion in the function `f` is causing the performance bottleneck. For `n = 20` (slow input), the recursion unfolds exponentially in terms of function calls due to the nature of the Fibonacci sequence calculation.
   - The expensive part is the repeated calculation of the same Fibonacci numbers, characteristic of naive recursive implementations without memoization.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Here are the natural language invariants that describe when and why the code slows down:

1. **Invariant 1 (Recursive Depth and Overlapping Subproblems)**:
   - "If the input `n` is large and approaches the upper limit of 20, the exponential growth in recursive calculations for Fibonacci-like sequences can significantly slow down the program due to overlapping subproblems being recalculated."

2. **Invariant 2 (Absence of Memoization)**:
   - "When a recursive function is called multiple times with the same arguments without memoization, the program may experience significant slowdowns as it performs redundant computations."

3. **Invariant 3 (High Recursive Call Overhead)**:
   - "If the recursion depth reaches a level where the number of function calls grows exponentially without optimization techniques like dynamic programming, the program's performance will degrade considerably."

### Additional Considerations

- **Thresholds**: The problem constraint (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) means that significant slowdowns occur as `n` approaches 20 due to the exponential nature of the recursive calls.
- **Optimization Suggestions**: Utilizing memoization or converting the recursive solution into an iterative one could mitigate the identified performance bottleneck.

These invariants broadly capture conditions under which the recursive function might lead to slow execution, focusing on the algorithmic inefficiency rather than just the input size.

=== Checker Response ===
### Phase 3: Implement Invariants as Checker Code in C++

For each invariant derived in Phase 2, here is the corresponding C++ checker code:

1. **Invariant 1 (Recursive Depth and Overlapping Subproblems)**:
   - This invariant checks if the input `n` is close to the upper constraint limit, indicating potential exponential growth in recursive calculations.

```cpp
void check_recursive_depth_invariant(int n) {
    if (n >= 15) {  // Threshold chosen based on the nature of exponential growth
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high recursive depth." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

2. **Invariant 2 (Absence of Memoization)**:
   - Checks if the function is being called recursively without memoization for large `n`.

```cpp
void check_memoization_invariant(int n, int callCount) {
    if (n >= 15 && callCount > 1000) {  // Call count threshold based on expected exponential calls
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive recursive calls without memoization." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

3. **Invariant 3 (High Recursive Call Overhead)**:
   - This invariant checks for the expected high call overhead in recursive functions.

```cpp
void check_call_overhead_invariant(int n, int callCount) {
    if (n >= 15 && callCount > 500) {  // This threshold accounts for expected recursive growth
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high recursive call overhead." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrate Checkers into the Original Program

Below is the instrumented C++ code with integrated performance checkers:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int a1, a2;
int recursiveCallCount = 0; // Track the number of recursive calls

// Checker functions
void check_recursive_depth_invariant(int n) {
    if (n >= 15) {  // Threshold chosen based on the nature of exponential growth
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high recursive depth." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_memoization_invariant(int n, int callCount) {
    if (n >= 15 && callCount > 1000) {  // Call count threshold based on expected exponential calls
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive recursive calls without memoization." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_call_overhead_invariant(int n, int callCount) {
    if (n >= 15 && callCount > 500) {  // This threshold accounts for expected recursive growth
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high recursive call overhead." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int f(int n) {
    recursiveCallCount++;
    check_memoization_invariant(n, recursiveCallCount); // Check for memoization issue
    check_call_overhead_invariant(n, recursiveCallCount); // Check for call overhead

    if (n == 0) return a1;
    if (n == 1) return a2;
    return f(n - 1) + f(n - 2);
}

int main() {
    int n;
    cin >> a1 >> a2 >> n;

    check_recursive_depth_invariant(n); // Check before starting the recursive process

    cout << f(n) << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of Inserted Checks

- **`check_recursive_depth_invariant`**: This check is placed before recursive calculations start, ensuring that any risky input configuration is caught early.
- **`check_memoization_invariant`** and **`check_call_overhead_invariant`**: These checks are placed inside the recursive function `f` to monitor its call patterns and detect performance bottlenecks during execution. They use the `recursiveCallCount` variable to track the depth and intensity of recursion.

This implementation ensures that the checks do not add overhead in tight loops, as they are invoked conditionally based on the depth and call patterns of the recursion.
