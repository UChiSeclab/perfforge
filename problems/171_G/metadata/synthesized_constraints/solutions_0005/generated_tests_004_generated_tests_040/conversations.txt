system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

  return 0; /* line 14 slow_hit_count: 1, fast_hit_count: 1 */
} /* line 15 slow_hit_count: 0, fast_hit_count: 0 */


assistant: ## Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs:**

   - The `fonk` function is invoked recursively, with line 4 (`int fonk(int c)`) being hit 21,891 times for the slow input and only 3 times for the fast input.
   - Line 7, where the recursion happens (`return fonk(c - 1) + fonk(c - 2);`), is hit 10,945 times for the slow input and only once for the fast input.

2. **Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input:**

   - The recursion in the `fonk` function is the primary contributor to the difference in performance.
   - The recursive calls increase exponentially with the value of `c`, leading to a significant increase in execution time for larger values of `c`.

3. **Infer interactions with data structures, loops, recursion, etc.:**

   - `fonk` implements a recursive calculation that is akin to computing Fibonacci numbers.
   - The inefficiency arises from direct recursion without memoization or iteration, leading to repeated redundant calculations of the same results for larger values of `c`.

## Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **Generate natural language statements for slow path conditions:**

   - **Invariant 1: Recursion Depth and Redundancy**
     - "If the value of `c` in the recursive function `fonk` is large, the number of recursive calls increases exponentially, which can drastically slow down execution."
     - **Reasoning:** This is due to the exponential growth in recursive calls as `c` increases, leading to repeated calculations.

   - **Invariant 2: Recursive Function Calls**
     - "When the recursive function `fonk` is called many times without caching results, performance degrades significantly due to redundant computations."
     - **Reasoning:** Inefficiency from recomputation of values that have already been calculated in the recursive tree.

2. **Abstract conditions and provide thresholds based on input constraints:**

   - "For the recursive function `fonk`, if `c` is close to the upper constraint (e.g., 20), the recursive call count can become very high, causing performance issues."

3. **Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns:**

   - The slowdown occurs notably when `c` is large relative to `a` and `b`, as in the slow input (`2 1 20`).

4. **Consider fuzzer utility and avoid checks inside tight loops:**

   - Checks and invariant detection should occur before deep recursion starts, i.e., before calling `fonk` with a high value of `c`.

## Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **Invariant 1: Recursion Growth**
   - "If the recursion depth in the function `fonk` exceeds a certain level (e.g., when `c` approaches 20), the number of recursive calls increases exponentially, leading to significant slowdown."

2. **Invariant 2: Computation Redundancy**
   - "When `fonk` is recursively invoked with a large `c` without optimization techniques such as memoization, the performance may degrade due to repeated calculations."

These statements capture the main performance issues, focusing on recursion depth and redundancy without hardcoding specific input values.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:

The only line of input contains three integers a1, a2, a3 (1 ≤ a1, a2, a3 ≤ 20), separated by spaces.

assistant: ## Phase 3: Implement Natural Language Invariants in C++

Below are the C++ code snippets that implement the performance-characterizing invariants inferred from the program analysis.

### Invariant 1: Recursion Depth and Redundancy
This invariant checks if the recursion depth in the function `fonk` exceeds a certain level, leading to excessive recursive calls.

```cpp
void check_recursion_invariant(int c) {
    if (c >= 20) { // We assume a depth close to the problem's constraint limit (20) can cause a slowdown
        cerr << "Warning: Recursion depth invariant triggered - excessive recursion depth" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Invariant 2: Computation Redundancy
This invariant checks for redundant calculations due to lack of optimization techniques like memoization.

```cpp
void check_computation_redundancy(int c) {
    if (c >= 20) { // Similar threshold for recognizing potentially redundant computation
        cerr << "Warning: Computation redundancy invariant triggered - redundant calculations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

## Phase 4: Insert Conditional Checks into the Original Program

Here is the original C++ program, instrumented with the invariant checks. The checks are inserted at effective points in the control flow of the program to avoid overhead in tight loops.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int a, b;

void check_recursion_invariant(int c) {
    if (c >= 20) { // Recursion depth check
        cerr << "Warning: Recursion depth invariant triggered - excessive recursion depth" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_computation_redundancy(int c) {
    if (c >= 20) { // Computation redundancy check
        cerr << "Warning: Computation redundancy invariant triggered - redundant calculations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int fonk(int c) {
    check_recursion_invariant(c); // Check before recursion
    check_computation_redundancy(c); // Check for redundant computations
    
    if (c == 0) return a;
    if (c == 1) return b;
    return fonk(c - 1) + fonk(c - 2);
}

int main() {
    int c;
    scanf("%d %d", &a, &b);
    scanf("%d", &c);

    printf("%d", fonk(c));
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of Integration

- **Invariant Checks:** The invariant checks (`check_recursion_invariant` and `check_computation_redundancy`) are placed before the recursive calls in the function `fonk` to detect potential performance bottlenecks due to deep recursion or redundant calculations.

- **Thresholds:** The check condition uses `c >= 20` as the threshold, which is the maximum allowable value based on the problem's constraints. This reflects potential performance triggers without relying on specific input values.

- **Abort on Trigger:** Each invariant check logs a warning and aborts program execution upon triggering, ensuring clear detection of performance issues during testing or fuzzing.
