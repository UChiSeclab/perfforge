### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

Based on the hit count information, the following lines are hit significantly more often in the slow input compared to the fast input:

1. **Line 39-40:** The construction of the `not_used` set with 100,000 elements.
2. **Line 43:** The `while` loop condition `ver.size() != n`, which runs 100,001 times.
3. **Line 44-46:** The maintenance of the `q` and `ver` sets.
4. **Line 48-48:** The `for` loop iterating over `not_used` within the `while` loop.
5. **Lines 49-55:** The conditional checks and set operations within the `for` loop.
6. **Line 59-60:** The `for` loop iterating over `to_er` for erasing elements from `not_used`.

The bottleneck appears to be the repeated iterations over potentially large sets (`not_used` and `to_er`) and the frequent insertions and erasures in unordered sets, which can become costly with large sizes.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Here are the natural language performance invariants that describe when the code encounters slow execution paths:

1. **Invariant: Large Graph with No Weighted Edges**
   - **Description:** When the number of vertices `n` is large and the number of weighted edges `m` is zero, the code performs extensive unnecessary iterations over all vertices because every edge is implicitly weight zero. This leads to a large number of operations for constructing the spanning tree.
   - **Condition:** The program is likely to slow down significantly with large values of `n` and `m` being zero, as the algorithm will needlessly visit all vertices in an attempt to form a minimum spanning tree.

2. **Invariant: Many Iterations Over Unused Vertices**
   - **Description:** If the set of unused vertices (`not_used`) becomes large and each vertex needs to be processed in a loop, the operations on this set can become a bottleneck due to frequent insertions, deletions, and membership checks.
   - **Condition:** Performance may degrade when the set of unused vertices is close to the total number of vertices, particularly when each membership check and operation on this set is repeated for every vertex.

3. **Invariant: Inefficient Handling of Vertex Connections**
   - **Description:** The frequent checks to see if vertex pairs are connected by a weighted edge become expensive with no weighted edges or with the majority of the graph being described by zero-weight edges. 
   - **Condition:** The number of operations grows when there are very few or no edges with weight 1, thus requiring many iterations to establish connections between all vertices.

These invariants highlight scenarios where the algorithm unnecessarily processes every vertex and edge in the graph, leading to performance degradation despite not contributing meaningful data for the minimum spanning tree calculation. Addressing these will help optimize the program for large input sizes and edge cases where `m` is zero.

### Phase 3: Implementing Natural Language Invariants as C++ Runtime Checks

For each natural language invariant identified, we will create a C++ function to check the condition at runtime. 

#### Invariant 1: Large Graph with No Weighted Edges
- **Description:** Detects if the graph is large with `n` vertices and `m` is zero.
- **Code:**
  ```cpp
  void check_no_edges_invariant(long long n, long long m) {
      if (n > 10000 && m == 0) {  // Example threshold for large n
          cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large graph with no weighted edges" << endl;
          abort();
      }
  }
  ```

#### Invariant 2: Many Iterations Over Unused Vertices
- **Description:** Detects when `not_used` set is large, indicating potential inefficiency.
- **Code:**
  ```cpp
  void check_not_used_invariant(size_t notUsedSize, long long n) {
      if (notUsedSize > n / 2) {  // A large portion of the vertices are unused
          cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - many unused vertices" << endl;
          abort();
      }
  }
  ```

#### Invariant 3: Inefficient Handling of Vertex Connections
- **Description:** Detects inefficiency when there are few or no edges with weight 1.
- **Code:**
  ```cpp
  void check_vertex_connection_invariant(long long numWeightedEdges, long long n) {
      if (numWeightedEdges < n / 100) {  // Few weighted edges compared to the size of the graph
          cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - inefficient vertex connections" << endl;
          abort();
      }
  }
  ```

### Phase 4: Integrate Checkers into Original C++ Program

Now, we integrate these checks into the original C++ code.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int IT_MAX = 1 << 17;
int MOD = 1e9 + 7;
const int INF = 0x3f3f3f3f;
const long long LL_INF = 0x0f3f3f3f3f3f3f3f;
const double PI = acos(-1);
const double ERR = 1e-10;

void check_no_edges_invariant(long long n, long long m) {
    if (n > 10000 && m == 0) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large graph with no weighted edges" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_not_used_invariant(size_t notUsedSize, long long n) {
    if (notUsedSize > n / 2) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - many unused vertices" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_vertex_connection_invariant(long long numWeightedEdges, long long n) {
    if (numWeightedEdges < n / 100) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - inefficient vertex connections" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cout.tie(0);
    cin.tie(0);

    long long n, m;
    cin >> n >> m;

    // Check for the first invariant after reading the input
    check_no_edges_invariant(n, m);

    vector<unordered_set<long long>> gr(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
        long long a, b;
        cin >> a >> b;
        --a;
        --b;
        gr[a].insert(b);
        gr[b].insert(a);
    }

    vector<long long> to(n);
    unordered_set<long long> ver;
    ver.reserve(1024);
    ver.max_load_factor(0.25);
    long long ans = 0;
    unordered_set<long long> q;
    q.reserve(1024);
    q.max_load_factor(0.25);
    q.insert(0);
    unordered_set<long long> not_used;
    not_used.reserve(1024);
    not_used.max_load_factor(0.25);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        not_used.insert(i);
    }
    not_used.erase(0);
    
    // Check for the second invariant before entering the while loop
    check_not_used_invariant(not_used.size(), n);
    
    while (ver.size() != n) {
        long long cur_ver = *q.begin();
        q.erase(cur_ver);
        ver.insert(cur_ver);
        vector<long long> to_er;
        for (auto i : not_used) {
            if (ver.count(i) == 0) {
                if (gr[cur_ver].count(i)) {
                    to[i]++;
                }
                if (to[i] != ver.size()) {
                    to_er.push_back(i);
                    q.insert(i);
                }
            }
        }
        for (auto i : to_er) {
            not_used.erase(i);
        }
        if (q.size() == 0 && ver.size() != n) {
            long long a = *not_used.begin();
            q.insert(a);
            not_used.erase(a);
            ++ans;
        }
    }

    // Check for the third invariant after processing
    check_vertex_connection_invariant(m, n);

    cout << ans;
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Check Insertion:** The `check_no_edges_invariant` is placed right after reading inputs. The `check_not_used_invariant` is placed before the while loop starts, and `check_vertex_connection_invariant` is checked after processing the graph to catch conditions leading to inefficiency.
2. **Placement:** These checks are placed outside tight loops to avoid overhead, ensuring they don't degrade performance further.
3. **Thresholds:** The thresholds are chosen to reflect conditions where performance issues are likely to occur, given the constraints and observed behaviors.
