system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

Ujan has a lot of useless stuff in his drawers, a considerable part of which are his math notebooks: it is time to sort them out. This time he found an old dusty graph theory notebook with a description of a graph.

It is an undirected weighted graph on n vertices. It is a complete graph: each pair of vertices is connected by an edge. The weight of each edge is either 0 or 1; exactly m edges have weight 1, and all others have weight 0.

Since Ujan doesn't really want to organize his notes, he decided to find the weight of the minimum spanning tree of the graph. (The weight of a spanning tree is the sum of all its edges.) Can you find the answer for Ujan so he stops procrastinating?

Input

The first line of the input contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ m ≤ min((n(n-1))/(2),10^5)), the number of vertices and the number of edges of weight 1 in the graph. 

The i-th of the next m lines contains two integers a_i and b_i (1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ n, a_i ≠ b_i), the endpoints of the i-th edge of weight 1.

It is guaranteed that no edge appears twice in the input.

Output

Output a single integer, the weight of the minimum spanning tree of the graph.

Note

The graph from the first sample is shown below. Dashed edges have weight 0, other edges have weight 1. One of the minimum spanning trees is highlighted in orange and has total weight 2.

In the second sample, all edges have weight 0 so any spanning tree has total weight 0.

assistant: ## Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

After analyzing the line-level hit counts for both the fast and slow inputs, we observe the following:

1. **Lines 6-8 (`dna` function):** The `dna` function is called 13 times in the fast case but not at all in the slow case. This suggests that the computation involves finding representative elements in a disjoint set union structure, relevant for merging sets.

2. **Lines 11-13 (`merge` function):** This function is invoked 3 times in the fast input, but not at all in the slow case. This indicates the merging operation, which utilizes the `dna` function, isn't triggered in the slow input.

3. **Lines 41-48:** The code block involving a nested loop from lines 42-44 only operates in the fast input. This is due to the condition `if (n <= bor)` evaluating to true only when `n` is small (specifically, `n <= 5000`). Hence, in the fast input, `merge` is repeatedly called here to connect components.

4. **No significant line hits in slow input:** This means the program structure is possibly avoiding many significant operations with the slow input configuration, specifically larger `n` handling when there are no edges of weight 1 (`m=0`).

## Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

### Performance Invariants

Based on the above analysis, here are some natural language invariants describing conditions leading to slow performance:

1. **Large Graph Handling:** 
   - Natural Language: "When the number of vertices `n` is large and all edges have a weight of zero, and `m = 0`, the program may not efficiently utilize disjoint set operations, leading to complexity in component merging due to no initial connections."
   
2. **Absence of Weighted Edges:**
   - Natural Language: "If `m = 0`, indicating all edges have weight zero, the problem becomes trivial to solve, but inefficient handling without early return can cause the program to appear slow on large graphs."

3. **Threshold-based Sparse Connection:**
   - Natural Language: "When the graph has a large number of vertices (`n` close to the upper limit), the absence of a more significant number of weighted edges (small `m`) while using inefficient data structures can result in skipping optimized paths, making it slow."

### Insights

- **Threshold for Efficient Path:** The program switches paths based on whether `n <= 5000`. For larger graphs, it should handle the connections more efficiently, especially when edge weights are absent or minimal.
- **Early Return Condition:** An early termination when `m=0` with a large `n` could prevent unnecessary operations and immediately return a result, optimizing for this edge case.
  
By integrating these insights, potential slowdowns can be diagnosed and addressed, leading to a more efficient handling of graph-related computations, specifically in the context of minimum spanning tree calculations in complete graphs.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function

Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
Ujan has a lot of useless stuff in his drawers, a considerable part of which are his math notebooks: it is time to sort them out. This time he found an old dusty graph theory notebook with a description of a graph.

It is an undirected weighted graph on n vertices. It is a complete graph: each pair of vertices is connected by an edge. The weight of each edge is either 0 or 1; exactly m edges have weight 1, and all others have weight 0.

Since Ujan doesn't really want to organize his notes, he decided to find the weight of the minimum spanning tree of the graph. (The weight of a spanning tree is the sum of all its edges.) Can you find the answer for Ujan so he stops procrastinating?

Input

The first line of the input contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ m ≤ min((n(n-1))/(2),10^5)), the number of vertices and the number of edges of weight 1 in the graph. 

The i-th of the next m lines contains two integers a_i and b_i (1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ n, a_i ≠ b_i), the endpoints of the i-th edge of weight 1.

It is guaranteed that no edge appears twice in the input.

Output

Output a single integer, the weight of the minimum spanning tree of the graph.

Examples

Input


6 11
1 3
1 4
1 5
1 6
2 3
2 4
2 5
2 6
3 4
3 5
3 6


Output


2


Input


3 0


Output


0

Note

The graph from the first sample is shown below. Dashed edges have weight 0, other edges have weight 1. One of the minimum spanning trees is highlighted in orange and has total weight 2.

In the second sample, all edges have weight 0 so any spanning tree has total weight 0.

Solution (C++ code):

assistant: ## Phase 3: Implementing the Natural Language Invariants in C++

Let's translate the performance-characterizing invariants into C++ checker code:

### Invariant 1: Large Graph Handling with No Edges of Weight 1
```cpp
void check_large_graph_no_edges(int n, int m) {
    if (n > 5000 && m == 0) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large graph with no heavy edges." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Invariant 2: Absence of Weighted Edges
```cpp
void check_absence_of_weighted_edges(int n, int m) {
    if (m == 0 && n > 10000) { // example threshold when the absence of edges might cause inefficiencies
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - absence of weighted edges in large graph." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Invariant 3: Threshold-based Sparse Connection
```cpp
void check_sparse_connection(int n, int m) {
    if (n > 5000 && m < 25) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - sparse connection in large graph." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

## Phase 4: Integrating the Checkers into the Original Program

Now, we'll integrate these checks into the C++ program. These checks should be placed after reading input values, where they can evaluate the state before the main computation begins.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
const int MAX = (int)1e5 + 5;
int n, m;
int dad[MAX];
int dna(int a) {
  if (dad[a] == a) return a;
  return dad[a] = dna(dad[a]);
}
void merge(int a, int b) {
  int pa = dna(a);
  int push_back = dna(b);
  dad[push_back] = pa;
}
set<pair<int, int> > s;
bool is0(int a, int b) {
  if (a > b) swap(a, b);
  return s.find({a, b}) == s.end();
}
const int bor = 5000;
bool p[bor + 5][bor + 5];
set<int> QWER;
int cnt[MAX];

void check_large_graph_no_edges(int n, int m) {
    if (n > 5000 && m == 0) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large graph with no heavy edges." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_absence_of_weighted_edges(int n, int m) {
    if (m == 0 && n > 10000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - absence of weighted edges in large graph." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_sparse_connection(int n, int m) {
    if (n > 5000 && m < 25) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - sparse connection in large graph." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
  scanf("%d%d", &n, &m);
  
  // Insert checker functions here to detect possible performance bottlenecks
  check_large_graph_no_edges(n, m);
  check_absence_of_weighted_edges(n, m);
  check_sparse_connection(n, m);

  for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
    int a, b;
    scanf("%d%d", &a, &b);
    a--;
    b--;
    cnt[a]++;
    cnt[b]++;
    if (a > b) swap(a, b);
    if (n <= bor) {
      p[a][b] = 1;
    } else {
      s.insert({a, b});
    }
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) dad[i] = i;
  if (n <= bor) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
      for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
        if (!p[i][j]) merge(i, j);
      }
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) QWER.insert(dna(i));
    printf("%d\n", (int)QWER.size() - 1);
    return 0;
  }
  set<int> q;
  int g = -1;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (cnt[i] < n - 25) {
      if (g < 0) g = i;
      continue;
    }
    q.insert(i);
  }
  srand(time(0));
  for (int i = 0; i < 50; i++) {
    int r = rand() * rand() + rand();
    q.insert(r % n);
  }
  if (g >= 0) q.insert(g);
  for (auto first : q) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      if (is0(first, i)) merge(first, i);
    }
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) QWER.insert(dna(i));
  printf("%d\n", (int)QWER.size() - 1);
  return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:

- **Placement of Checks:** The checks are inserted immediately after reading the input parameters `n` and `m`, so they can prevent unnecessary computations if a performance bottleneck condition is detected.
- **Abstraction:** The checks are designed to abstractly represent the conditions that could lead to performance problems, based on the previously derived natural language invariants.
