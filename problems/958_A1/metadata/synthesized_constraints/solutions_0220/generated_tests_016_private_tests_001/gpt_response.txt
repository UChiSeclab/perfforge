=== Invariants Response ===
To diagnose the performance bottlenecks in the given C program, we need to compare the line-level hit counts for both the fast and slow inputs and identify patterns leading to slow execution. Let's break down the analysis into phases:

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Observation of Hit Counts:**
   - The `check` function (lines 11-17) shows a significant number of hits for the slow input compared to the fast input, suggesting it's repeatedly being invoked unnecessarily or in a costly manner.
   - Functions `fun1`, `fun2`, `fun3`, `fun4`, and `fun5` (lines 19-64) also exhibit higher hit counts for the slow input, indicating frequent transformations of the map that may not be optimizing the process well.
   - The loop starting at line 81 and nested within it (lines 87-105) has excessive hit counts, suggesting that the permutations and transformations of the map are leading to many checks.

2. **Potential Causes:**
   - The use of `next_permutation` leads to a combinatorial explosion of permutations, causing excessive transformations and checks.
   - The repeated usage of transformation functions `fun1` to `fun5` without early exits contributes to the high number of operations.
   - The nested loop structure combined with the `check` function inside the innermost loop increases the computational cost when `n` is at its maximum (n = 10).

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Using the observations from Phase 1, we can derive the following natural language performance invariants:

1. **Invariant 1: Permutation Explosion with Transformations**
   - "When the map size is at its maximum (n = 10), the algorithm's permutation approach can lead to a combinatorial explosion, causing many unnecessary transformations and checks. Consider optimizing the permutation and transformation strategy to reduce redundant checks."

2. **Invariant 2: Inefficient Repeated Transformations**
   - "If the map undergoes frequent transformations without early exits upon finding a match, the program may perform excessive operations. Ensure that transformations are only executed when necessary, and incorporate early termination logic."

3. **Invariant 3: High Cost of Frequent Checks**
   - "The `check` function is repeatedly invoked during transformation permutations, leading to high computational costs when n is large. Streamline the check process, potentially by integrating checks directly into transformations when feasible."

### Summary

The slow input performance issue is primarily due to the combinatorial nature of permutations and repeated transformations/checks, which are exacerbated by the maximum input constraint (n = 10). Optimizing the algorithm to reduce unnecessary permutations and integrate checks more efficiently can mitigate slowdowns. By abstracting these conditions into general performance invariants, the code can be more resilient to future slow scenarios within the given constraints.

### Phase 3: Implement the Performance-Characterizing Invariants in C++

Based on the previously inferred natural language invariants, we can now implement the corresponding C++ runtime checks. Here are the code snippets for each invariant:

```cpp
void check_permutation_explosion(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to permutation explosion!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_repeated_transformations(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to repeated transformations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_frequent_checks(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to frequent checks!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrate the Checker Code into the Original Program

Now, let's integrate these checks into the original C++ program at strategic points to effectively monitor performance bottlenecks.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int debug_num = 0;
const int maxn = 20;
struct node {
  char mapp[maxn][maxn];
};
node sta;
node ans;
int n;

// Check for permutation explosion
void check_permutation_explosion(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to permutation explosion!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Check for repeated transformations
void check_repeated_transformations(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to repeated transformations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Check for frequent checks
void check_frequent_checks(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to frequent checks!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

bool check(node a) {
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
    for (int j = 1; j <= n; ++j) {
      if (ans.mapp[i][j] != a.mapp[i][j]) return false;
    }
  }
  return true;
}

node fun1(const node &a) {
  node temp;
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
    for (int j = 1; j <= n; ++j) {
      temp.mapp[i][j] = a.mapp[n + 1 - j][i];
    }
  }
  return temp;
}

node fun2(const node &a) {
  node temp;
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
    for (int j = 1; j <= n; ++j) {
      temp.mapp[i][j] = a.mapp[n + 1 - j][n + 1 - i];
    }
  }
  return temp;
}

node fun3(const node &a) {
  node temp;
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
    for (int j = 1; j <= n; ++j) {
      temp.mapp[i][j] = a.mapp[j][n + 1 - i];
    }
  }
  return temp;
}

node fun4(const node &a) {
  node temp;
  temp = a;
  for (int i = 1; i <= n / 2; ++i) {
    for (int j = 1; j <= n; ++j) {
      swap(temp.mapp[i][j], temp.mapp[n + 1 - i][j]);
    }
  }
  return temp;
}

node fun5(const node &a) {
  node temp;
  temp = a;
  for (int i = 1; i <= n / 2; ++i) {
    for (int j = 1; j <= n; ++j) {
      swap(temp.mapp[j][i], temp.mapp[j][n + 1 - i]);
    }
  }
  return temp;
}

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin >> n;
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
    for (int j = 1; j <= n; ++j) {
      cin >> sta.mapp[i][j];
    }
  }
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
    for (int j = 1; j <= n; ++j) {
      cin >> ans.mapp[i][j];
    }
  }
  
  // Check permutation explosion when n is at maximum limit
  check_permutation_explosion(n == 10);

  int flag = 0;
  string s = "12345";
  do {
    node now = sta;
    if (check(now)) {
      flag = 1;
      break;
    }
    
    // Checking repeated transformations
    int transformation_count = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= 5; ++i) {
      int id = s[i] - '0';
      if (id == 1) {
        now = fun1(now);
      } else if (id == 2) {
        now = fun2(now);
      } else if (id == 3) {
        now = fun3(now);
      } else if (id == 4) {
        now = fun4(now);
      } else {
        now = fun5(now);
      }
      
      transformation_count++;
      
      // Limit transformations on maximum map size
      check_repeated_transformations(transformation_count > 6 && n == 10);

      if (check(now)) {
        flag = 1;
        break;
      }
    }
    
    // Check frequency of checks
    check_frequent_checks(!flag && n == 10);

    if (flag) break;
  } while (next_permutation(s.begin(), s.end()));
  
  if (flag)
    cout << "Yes" << endl;
  else
    cout << "No" << endl;
    
  return 0;
}
```

In this instrumented program:
- **`check_permutation_explosion`**: This check is placed right after input reading to ensure we avoid combinatorial explosion when n is at its maximum.
- **`check_repeated_transformations`**: This check is inside the transformation loop to ensure transformations don't exceed a reasonable count when n is large.
- **`check_frequent_checks`**: This check ensures that excessive checks are happening only when a solution isn't found early for large n values. 

These checks will help identify potential performance issues during execution, aiding debugging and fuzzer testing.
