system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

The stardate is 1977 and the science and art of detecting Death Stars is in its infancy. Princess Heidi has received information about the stars in the nearby solar system from the Rebel spies and now, to help her identify the exact location of the Death Star, she needs to know whether this information is correct. 

Two rebel spies have provided her with the maps of the solar system. Each map is an N × N grid, where each cell is either occupied by a star or empty. To see whether the information is correct, Heidi needs to know whether the two maps are of the same solar system, or if possibly one of the spies is actually an Empire double agent, feeding her false information.

Unfortunately, spies may have accidentally rotated a map by 90, 180, or 270 degrees, or flipped it along the vertical or the horizontal axis, before delivering it to Heidi. If Heidi can rotate or flip the maps so that two of them become identical, then those maps are of the same solar system. Otherwise, there are traitors in the Rebel ranks! Help Heidi find out.

Input

The first line of the input contains one number N (1 ≤ N ≤ 10) – the dimension of each map. Next N lines each contain N characters, depicting the first map: 'X' indicates a star, while 'O' indicates an empty quadrant of space. Next N lines each contain N characters, depicting the second map in the same format.

Output

The only line of output should contain the word Yes if the maps are identical, or No if it is impossible to match them by performing rotations and translations.

Examples

Input

4
XOOO
XXOO
OOOO
XXXX
XOOO
XOOO
XOXO
XOXX


Output

Yes


Input

2
XX
OO
XO
OX


Output

No

Note

In the first test, you can match the first map to the second map by first flipping the first map along the vertical axis, and then by rotating it 90 degrees clockwise.

assistant: ### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Comparison of Hit Counts**:
   - The `rotate()` function is called significantly more often during the slow input, with a line-level hit count of 8 versus 2 for the fast input.
   - Lines inside the `rotate()` function, such as the initialization of the temporary string array `t` (line 13) and the nested loops (lines 14-19), have very high hit counts for the slow input.
   - The `flip()` function is called once for the slow input but not for the fast input.

2. **Pinpointing Lines**:
   - Inside `rotate()`, line 13 (`string t[N];`) is executed very frequently, indicating repeated memory allocation and initialization.
   - Lines 16 and 19, which involve the nested loop and the copying of matrix elements, show significant hit count differences between slow and fast inputs.
   - The `flip()` function (lines 22-25) is executed during the slow input and includes nested loop operations.

3. **Inference**:
   - The repeated invocation of `rotate()` indicates that the slow input causes the code to go through multiple matrix transformations repeatedly before a match is found or concluded impossible.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **Invariant 1: Repeated Rotations and Matrix Transformations**:
   - **Natural Language Description**: 
     - "If the map requires multiple rotations to align correctly with the target map, and each rotation involves extensive matrix element copying and memory operations, the execution time may increase significantly."
   - **Explanation**: 
     - This covers scenarios where the matrix requires multiple rotations, leading to repeated computational overhead and memory operations.

2. **Invariant 2: Complex Flip Requirements**:
   - **Natural Language Description**: 
     - "When a flip operation, followed by multiple rotations, is needed to achieve alignment, the combination of operations can lead to increased execution time."
   - **Explanation**: 
     - If alignment requires a flip operation and additional rotations, the added complexity can degrade performance.

3. **Invariant 3: Large Matrix Operation**:
   - **Natural Language Description**: 
     - "If each transformation (rotation or flip) requires processing an entire large matrix (e.g., close to the maximum size of 10x10), the program might slow down due to the volume of data being manipulated."
   - **Explanation**: 
     - The invariant highlights that the program becomes slower when the operations involve the entire matrix, especially as `N` approaches its upper limit of 10.

### Conclusion

The slow performance is primarily triggered by repeated complex transformations, including both rotation and flip operations, especially when the matrix size is large and requires multiple manipulations to achieve alignment. These invariants help in identifying potential performance bottlenecks in similar future scenarios without relying on specific numeric values from the current slow input.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
The stardate is 1977 and the science and art of detecting Death Stars is in its infancy. Princess Heidi has received information about the stars in the nearby solar system from the Rebel spies and now, to help her identify the exact location of the Death Star, she needs to know whether this information is correct. 

Two rebel spies have provided her with the maps of the solar system. Each map is an N × N grid, where each cell is either occupied by a star or empty. To see whether the information is correct, Heidi needs to know whether the two maps are of the same solar system, or if possibly one of the spies is actually an Empire double agent, feeding her false information.

Unfortunately, spies may have accidentally rotated a map by 90, 180, or 270 degrees, or flipped it along the vertical or the horizontal axis, before delivering it to Heidi. If Heidi can rotate or flip the maps so that two of them become identical, then those maps are of the same solar system. Otherwise, there are traitors in the Rebel ranks! Help Heidi find out.

Input

The first line of the input contains one number N (1 ≤ N ≤ 10) – the dimension of each map. Next N lines each contain N characters, depicting the first map: 'X' indicates a star, while 'O' indicates an empty quadrant of space. Next N lines each contain N characters, depicting the second map in the same format.

Output

The only line of output should contain the word Yes if the maps are identical, or No if it is impossible to match them by performing rotations and translations.

Examples

Input

4
XOOO
XXOO
OOOO
XXXX
XOOO
XOOO
XOXO
XOXX


Output

Yes


Input

2
XX
OO
XO
OX


Output

No

Note

In the first test, you can match the first map to the second map by first flipping the first map along the vertical axis, and then by rotating it 90 degrees clockwise.

Solution (C++ code):
{solution}


assistant: ### Phase 3: Implement the Natural Language Invariants in C++

Below are the C++ implementations of the performance-characterizing invariants derived in Phase 2. The checker functions will abort the program if a specific performance bottleneck condition is met.

#### Invariant 1: Repeated Rotations and Matrix Transformations
```cpp
void check_repeated_rotations(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - repeated rotations of large matrix!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

#### Invariant 2: Complex Flip Requirements
```cpp
void check_complex_flip(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - complex flip requirements and multiple rotations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

#### Invariant 3: Large Matrix Operation
```cpp
void check_large_matrix(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large matrix operations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrate Checker Functions into the Original Code

We will add the above checker functions to the code at strategic points to ensure they do not introduce unnecessary overhead in tight loops but effectively catch performance bottlenecks.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

const int MAX_N = 10; // max value of N as per problem constraints
string s[MAX_N], x[MAX_N];
int n;

// Check for repeated rotations of a large matrix
void check_repeated_rotations(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - repeated rotations of large matrix!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Check for complex flip requirements and multiple rotations
void check_complex_flip(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - complex flip requirements and multiple rotations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Check for large matrix operations
void check_large_matrix(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large matrix operations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void rotate() {
    string t[MAX_N];
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        t[i] = string(n, '0');
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j)
            t[i][j] = s[j][n - 1 - i];
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) s[i] = t[i];
}

void flip() {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
        for (int j = i + 1; j < n; ++j)
            swap(s[i][j], s[j][i]);
}

void solve() {
    cin >> n;

    // Check for large matrix operations
    check_large_matrix(n > 8); // Example threshold based on problem constraints

    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) cin >> s[i];
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) cin >> x[i];

    int rotation_count = 0;

    for (int t = 0; t < 4; ++t) {
        bool check = true;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
            if (s[i] != x[i]) check = false;
        if (check) {
            puts("Yes");
            return;
        }
        rotate();
        rotation_count++;
    }

    // Check for repeated rotations
    check_repeated_rotations(rotation_count >= 4);

    flip();
    rotation_count = 0;

    for (int t = 0; t < 4; ++t) {
        bool check = true;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
            if (s[i] != x[i]) check = false;
        if (check) {
            puts("Yes");
            return;
        }
        rotate();
        rotation_count++;
    }

    // Check for complex flip requirements and multiple rotations
    check_complex_flip(rotation_count >= 4 && flip_count > 0);

    puts("No");
}

int main() {
    int Test = 1;
    for (int i = 0; i < Test; ++i) {
        solve();
    }
}
```

### Explanation

- **check_large_matrix**: Inserted after reading `n` to detect potentially large operations on the matrix.
- **check_repeated_rotations**: Placed after the initial series of rotations to catch files where all four rotations are needed.
- **check_complex_flip**: Placed after flips and rotations to detect sequences that require both operations extensively.
