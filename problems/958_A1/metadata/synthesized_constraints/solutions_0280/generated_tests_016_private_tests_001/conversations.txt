system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

The stardate is 1977 and the science and art of detecting Death Stars is in its infancy. Princess Heidi has received information about the stars in the nearby solar system from the Rebel spies and now, to help her identify the exact location of the Death Star, she needs to know whether this information is correct. 

Two rebel spies have provided her with the maps of the solar system. Each map is an N × N grid, where each cell is either occupied by a star or empty. To see whether the information is correct, Heidi needs to know whether the two maps are of the same solar system, or if possibly one of the spies is actually an Empire double agent, feeding her false information.

Unfortunately, spies may have accidentally rotated a map by 90, 180, or 270 degrees, or flipped it along the vertical or the horizontal axis, before delivering it to Heidi. If Heidi can rotate or flip the maps so that two of them become identical, then those maps are of the same solar system. Otherwise, there are traitors in the Rebel ranks! Help Heidi find out.

Input

The first line of the input contains one number N (1 ≤ N ≤ 10) – the dimension of each map. Next N lines each contain N characters, depicting the first map: 'X' indicates a star, while 'O' indicates an empty quadrant of space. Next N lines each contain N characters, depicting the second map in the same format.

Output

The only line of output should contain the word Yes if the maps are identical, or No if it is impossible to match them by performing rotations and translations.

assistant: To analyze the provided C program and identify performance bottlenecks, let's go through the steps:

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Compare Line-Level Hit Counts**: 
   - The `rot()` function (lines 5-10) and the `dfs()` function (lines 17-38) exhibit significantly higher hit counts in the slow input compared to the fast input.

2. **Pinpoint Problematic Lines or Functions**:
   - **`rot()` Function**: The loop within this function (lines 6-9) is heavily hit, indicating the rotation operation is frequently performed.
   - **`dfs()` Function**: The `dfs(a + 1)` recursive calls (lines 27, 30, 35) are invoked repeatedly, suggesting extensive recursion depth. The swaps (lines 29, 32, 34) also have high hit counts.

3. **Interaction with Data Structures**:
   - The program involves an `N x N` grid (`s`, `t`, `T`, `A`) where `N` can be up to 10. This implies that operations on these 2D arrays are computationally intensive when repeated often.
   - The depth of recursion and repeated transformation of the matrix (`rot` and `swap` operations) are key contributors to the slowdown.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the analysis, let's define the conditions that may lead to slow performance:

1. **Recursive Depth and High Repetition**:
   - **Invariant**: "When the recursion explores many possible transformations and repeatedly applies rotations and flips, the computation becomes significantly expensive."
   - **Explanation**: The recursive function `dfs` generates numerous permutations of the map through rotations and flips, and the high number of recursive calls (in slow cases) exponentially increases the operations performed.

2. **Inefficient Transformations**:
   - **Invariant**: "If the process frequently rotates or flips the grid, performance may degrade due to repeated transformations."
   - **Explanation**: The `rot` function and swap operations within `dfs` are invoked multiple times, leading to high computational overhead.

3. **Lack of Early Termination**:
   - **Invariant**: "If early matches in map comparison are not found, the process becomes slower as it explores all transformation paths exhaustively."
   - **Explanation**: The recursive exploration of transformation paths continues until a match is found or all possibilities are exhausted, which is costly if no early match is detected.

**Code Implementation Suggestions**:
- Consider adding memoization or pruning strategies to reduce redundant transformations.
- Implement checks to avoid unnecessary recursive calls once a match is found.

By understanding these performance triggers, developers can optimize the program by limiting excessive recursion and redundant operations, thus improving its efficiency in handling larger grids (as allowed by the problem constraints).

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

assistant: ### Phase 3: Implementing the Natural Language Invariants in C++

Let's implement the performance-characterizing invariants identified previously, using the provided template for runtime checks.

1. **Recursive Depth and High Repetition**:
   This invariant identifies potential performance issues when the recursion explores many permutations with repeated transformations.

    ```cpp
    void check_dfs_invariant(int depth, int maxDepth) {
        if (depth > maxDepth) {
            cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - excessive recursion depth!" << endl;
            abort();
        }
    }
    ```

2. **Inefficient Transformations**:
   This invariant checks for frequent rotations or flips that can degrade performance.

    ```cpp
    void check_transformation_invariant(int transformationCount, int maxTransformations) {
        if (transformationCount > maxTransformations) {
            cerr << "Warning: transformation_invariant triggered - too many transformations!" << endl;
            abort();
        }
    }
    ```

3. **Lack of Early Termination**:
   This invariant would ideally check whether the process of matching maps takes too long due to exhaustive exploration.

    ```cpp
    void check_early_termination_invariant(bool matchFound, int currentDepth, int maxDepth) {
        if (!matchFound && currentDepth >= maxDepth) {
            cerr << "Warning: early_termination_invariant triggered - no early match found!" << endl;
            abort();
        }
    }
    ```

### Phase 4: Integrating Checker Code into the Original Program

Now, let's integrate these checks into the given C++ program at appropriate points to ensure they do not add overhead in tight loops.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
char s[20][20], t[20][20], T[20][20];
int n;

void rot() {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j)
            t[j][n - 1 - i] = s[i][j];
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j)
            s[i][j] = t[i][j];
}

bool chk() {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j)
            if (T[i][j] != s[i][j])
                return false;
    return true;
}

void dfs(int a, int maxDepth) {
    check_dfs_invariant(a, maxDepth); // Detect excessive recursion depth
    if (a >= 8) return;
    if (chk()) {
        puts("Yes");
        exit(0);
    }
    int A[20][20];
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j)
            A[i][j] = s[i][j];
    rot();
    dfs(a + 1, maxDepth);
    for (int i = 0; i < n - 1 - i; ++i)
        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j)
            swap(s[i][j], s[n - 1 - i][j]);
    dfs(a + 1, maxDepth);
    for (int i = 0; i < n - 1 - i; ++i)
        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j)
            swap(s[i][j], s[n - 1 - i][j]);
    for (int i = 0; i < n - 1 - i; ++i)
        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j)
            swap(s[j][i], s[j][n - 1 - i]);
    dfs(a + 1, maxDepth);
    for (int i = 0; i < n - 1 - i; ++i)
        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j)
            swap(s[j][i], s[j][n - 1 - i]);
}

int main() {
    scanf("%d", &n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) scanf("%s", s[i]);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) scanf("%s", T[i]);
    int maxDepth = 8; // Allowable depth for transformations
    dfs(0, maxDepth);
    puts("No");
}
```

### Explanation:
- **`check_dfs_invariant`**: Inserted at the start of the `dfs` function to monitor recursion depth.
- **`check_transformation_invariant`**: Not explicitly inserted, as the program's recursive structure inherently limits transformations.
- **`check_early_termination_invariant`**: Inserted conceptually, but ensuring early exits when a match is found.

These checks help detect when the program might take a slow path due to excessive recursion or transformations, thus allowing for optimization insights or debugging during testing.
