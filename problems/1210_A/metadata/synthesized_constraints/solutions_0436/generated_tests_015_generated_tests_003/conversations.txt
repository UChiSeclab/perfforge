system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

Anadi has a set of dominoes. Every domino has two parts, and each part contains some dots. For every a and b such that 1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 6, there is exactly one domino with a dots on one half and b dots on the other half. The set contains exactly 21 dominoes. Here is an exact illustration of his set:

<image>

Also, Anadi has an undirected graph without self-loops and multiple edges. He wants to choose some dominoes and place them on the edges of this graph. He can use at most one domino of each type. Each edge can fit at most one domino. It's not necessary to place a domino on each edge of the graph.

When placing a domino on an edge, he also chooses its direction. In other words, one half of any placed domino must be directed toward one of the endpoints of the edge and the other half must be directed toward the other endpoint. There's a catch: if there are multiple halves of dominoes directed toward the same vertex, each of these halves must contain the same number of dots.

How many dominoes at most can Anadi place on the edges of his graph?

Input

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 7, 0 ≤ m ≤ (n⋅(n-1))/(2)) — the number of vertices and the number of edges in the graph.

The next m lines contain two integers each. Integers in the i-th line are a_i and b_i (1 ≤ a, b ≤ n, a ≠ b) and denote that there is an edge which connects vertices a_i and b_i.

The graph might be disconnected. It's however guaranteed that the graph doesn't contain any self-loops, and that there is at most one edge between any pair of vertices.

Output

Output one integer which denotes the maximum number of dominoes which Anadi can place on the edges of the graph.

And here is one of the ways to place a domino on each of its edges:

Note that each vertex is faced by the halves of dominoes with the same number of dots. For instance, all halves directed toward vertex 1 have three dots.

assistant: To diagnose the performance bottleneck in the given C program, let's first analyze the hit counts for the slow and fast inputs to identify which parts of the code are contributing to the slowdown.

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Hit Count Analysis**:
   - The `dfs` function (lines 8-23) sees a drastic increase in hit counts for the slow input compared to the fast input. Specifically, line 9 (the outer loop) and line 10 (the inner loop) have a significantly higher number of executions in the slow run.
   - Lines 36-39 in the `check` function also exhibit increased activity for the slow input. These lines handle iterating over potential domino configurations and calling `dfs`.
   - The `reCov` function (lines 44-53) is recursively generating combinations for the vertices, and its recursive call at line 51 shows increased activity for the slow input.

2. **Data and Control Flow Interaction**:
   - The increase in hit counts indicates that the recursive nature of `reCov` is leading to a much larger number of configurations being tested for the slow input than the fast input.
   - The `dfs` function is heavily used to explore possible valid placements of dominoes, which becomes expensive with more possible configurations (combinatorial explosion).

3. **Constraints and Loops**:
   - With `n <= 7`, the level of recursion and the combinations of placements can grow rapidly. The recursive depth is directly related to `n`, and the combination checking (`reCov`) grows factorially.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Here are the conditions under which the program is likely to slow down, expressed in natural language:

1. **High Combinatorial Complexity**:
   - When the number of vertices `n` is at its maximum (close to 7), the recursive exploration (`reCov`) leads to factorial growth in potential domino placements across the graph. This is due to each vertex potentially taking on multiple values (domino numbers), hence a high branching factor at each level of recursion.

   Natural language invariant: "If the number of vertices `n` is near its upper limit and the recursive configuration exploration (`reCov`) runs deeply, the number of potential domino placements can grow factorially, causing a slowdown."

2. **Increased DFS Calls**:
   - The `dfs` function is called repeatedly to check possible placements of domino halves, and this is exacerbated when the graph structure allows many configurations to be checked. High hit counts in `dfs` indicate it is a combinatorial bottleneck.

   Natural language invariant: "When `dfs` is invoked frequently due to a large number of configuration checks, and the graph allows many potential domino placements, this can significantly degrade performance."

3. **Graph Structure Impact**:
   - A graph with a structure that allows many vertex connections (near the maximum `m` edges for given `n`) increases the number of configurations `check` evaluates. This causes the code to explore many configurations through recursive backtracking.

   Natural language invariant: "If the graph is densely connected (maximizing `m` with respect to `n`), and multiple configurations are explored, the program performance may degrade due to increased backtracking."

These invariants illustrate the conditions under which the input causes a combinatorial explosion in the number of configurations the program must evaluate, leading to performance degradation. These conditions are tied directly to the size and connectivity of the graph and the recursive exploration logic.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
Anadi has a set of dominoes. Every domino has two parts, and each part contains some dots. For every a and b such that 1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 6, there is exactly one domino with a dots on one half and b dots on the other half. The set contains exactly 21 dominoes. Here is an exact illustration of his set:

<image>

Also, Anadi has an undirected graph without self-loops and multiple edges. He wants to choose some dominoes and place them on the edges of this graph. He can use at most one domino of each type. Each edge can fit at most one domino. It's not necessary to place a domino on each edge of the graph.

When placing a domino on an edge, he also chooses its direction. In other words, one half of any placed domino must be directed toward one of the endpoints of the edge and the other half must be directed toward the other endpoint. There's a catch: if there are multiple halves of dominoes directed toward the same vertex, each of these halves must contain the same number of dots.

How many dominoes at most can Anadi place on the edges of his graph?

Input

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 7, 0 ≤ m ≤ (n⋅(n-1))/(2)) — the number of vertices and the number of edges in the graph.

The next m lines contain two integers each. Integers in the i-th line are a_i and b_i (1 ≤ a, b ≤ n, a ≠ b) and denote that there is an edge which connects vertices a_i and b_i.

The graph might be disconnected. It's however guaranteed that the graph doesn't contain any self-loops, and that there is at most one edge between any pair of vertices.

Output

Output one integer which denotes the maximum number of dominoes which Anadi can place on the edges of the graph.

Note

Here is an illustration of Anadi's graph from the first sample test:

And here is one of the ways to place a domino on each of its edges:

<image>

Note that each vertex is faced by the halves of dominoes with the same number of dots. For instance, all halves directed toward vertex 1 have three dots.

assistant: ### Phase 3: Implement the Natural Language Invariants in C++

Let's implement checkers for each of the performance characterizing invariants derived in the previous stage.

1. **High Combinatorial Complexity Checker**:
   - This checker will warn if the number of vertices `n` is near its maximum, suggesting a potentially high number of recursive calls in `reCov`.

```cpp
void check_combinatorial_complexity(int n) {
    if (n == 7) {  // Since n <= 7, close to maximum
        cerr << "Warning: Combinatorial complexity triggered - maximum recursion depth in reCov" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

2. **Increased DFS Calls Checker**:
   - This checker warns if there are many calls to `dfs`, which could indicate excessive configuration checks.

```cpp
void check_dfs_calls(int dfsCallCount) {
    if (dfsCallCount > 5000000) {  // Set a threshold based on typical excessive call scenarios
        cerr << "Warning: Excessive DFS calls detected - potential performance bottleneck" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

3. **Graph Structure Impact Checker**:
   - This checker assesses whether the graph is densely connected, thereby increasing configuration exploration.

```cpp
void check_graph_density(int n, int m) {
    if (m > (n * (n - 1)) / 4) {  // Arbitrary threshold for dense graph relative to n
        cerr << "Warning: Dense graph structure triggered - increased configuration exploration" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrate Checker Code into the Original Program

Now, let's integrate these checkers into the provided C++ program. We need to ensure that they are placed in such a way that they do not add unnecessary overhead during execution, particularly avoiding tight loops.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int n, m;
int mp[14][14], res[14];
int ans;
int go[54][54], lk[54];
bool vis[54];
int dfsCallCount = 0;  // To count DFS calls

void check_combinatorial_complexity(int n) {
    if (n == 7) {
        cerr << "Warning: Combinatorial complexity triggered - maximum recursion depth in reCov" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_dfs_calls(int dfsCallCount) {
    if (dfsCallCount > 5000000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Excessive DFS calls detected - potential performance bottleneck" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_graph_density(int n, int m) {
    if (m > (n * (n - 1)) / 4) {
        cerr << "Warning: Dense graph structure triggered - increased configuration exploration" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

bool dfs(int x) {
    dfsCallCount++;  // Increment every time dfs is called
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j <= n; j++) {
            int to = i * n + j;
            if (!go[x][to]) continue;
            if (!vis[to]) {
                vis[to] = 1;
                if (lk[to] == 0 || dfs(lk[to])) {
                    lk[to] = x;
                    return 1;
                }
            }
        }
    }
    return 0;
}

void check() {
    memset(go, 0, sizeof(go));
    memset(lk, 0, sizeof(lk));
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j <= n; j++) {
            if (!mp[i][j]) continue;
            int a = res[i], b = res[j];
            if (a > b) swap(a, b);
            go[a * 7 + b][i * n + j] = 1;
        }
    }
    int now = 0;
    for (int a = 1; a <= 6; a++) {
        for (int b = a; b <= 6; b++) {
            memset(vis, 0, sizeof(vis));
            if (dfs(a * 7 + b)) ++now;
        }
    }
    ans = max(ans, now);
}

void reCov(int x, int lim) {
    if (x > lim) {
        check();
        return;
    }
    for (int i = 1; i <= 6; i++) {
        res[x] = i;
        reCov(x + 1, lim);
    }
}

int main() {
    ans = 0;
    scanf("%d%d", &n, &m);

    // Integrate checkers right after reading inputs
    check_combinatorial_complexity(n);
    check_graph_density(n, m);

    for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
        int a, b;
        scanf("%d%d", &a, &b);
        mp[a][b] = 1;
        mp[b][a] = 1;
    }
    reCov(1, n);

    // Check the number of DFS calls
    check_dfs_calls(dfsCallCount);

    printf("%d\n", ans);
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of Instrumentation

- **Combinatorial Complexity Check**: Placed right after reading the input to ensure that the complexity check is assessed before recursive exploration starts.
- **Graph Density Check**: Also added after input parsing, as the number of edges (`m`) directly influences this condition.
- **DFS Call Count Check**: Implemented after the main processing (`reCov`) to verify if DFS calls exceeded the threshold, indicating a performance bottleneck.
  
This setup ensures minimal runtime overhead while effectively monitoring potential bottlenecks.
