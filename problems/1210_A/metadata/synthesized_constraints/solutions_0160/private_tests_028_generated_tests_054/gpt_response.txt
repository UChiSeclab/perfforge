### Phase 1: Identifying Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

From the provided hit count data, we observe the following:

1. **`countDom()` function**:
   - Lines 12 and 13 in the `countDom()` function have higher hits for the slow input compared to the fast input. Specifically, line 13 (`for (int v : gr[i])`) is hit significantly more often in the slow input. This suggests that this loop is a bottleneck when processing the graph.
   - Lines 14 and 15 are also hit more frequently in the slow input, indicating that the condition and update for `dom[node[i]][node[v]]` are involved in the slowdown.

2. **`solve()` function**:
   - Line 30 (`while (node[1] != 2)`) has the same number of hits for both inputs, indicating it runs a fixed number of iterations.
   - The expensive calls to `countDom()` (line 32) show that the bottleneck is within the graph traversal and checking logic in `countDom()`.

Given the problem constraints (n ≤ 7, m ≤ 21), the code appears to be performing a form of exhaustive search or permutation testing across different configurations of domino placements, which can become computationally expensive when the graph is dense or has many edges.

### Phase 2: Deriving Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the analysis, the slowdown can be characterized by the following invariant conditions:

1. **Invariant: High Degree of Vertices**  
   Natural Language Description: "If the graph has vertices with high degree, the number of possible domino configurations increases significantly, leading to more iterations in nested loops and thus slowing down the program."
   - This invariant reflects the observation that when vertices are connected to many other vertices, the potential configurations multiply, especially when each vertex must satisfy the condition that all incoming domino halves have the same number of dots.

2. **Invariant: Dense Graph Structure**  
   Natural Language Description: "When the graph is densely connected, meaning it has a large number of edges relative to the number of vertices, the exhaustive search through possible domino placements becomes computationally intensive."
   - A dense graph (close to the maximum number of edges) leads to more possible permutations of domino placements that need to be checked, increasing the hit count in loops significantly.

3. **Invariant: Symmetrical Configurations**  
   Natural Language Description: "Graphs that allow symmetrical configurations of domino placements may cause redundant calculations, where multiple equivalent states are evaluated, slowing down the execution."
   - This relates to scenarios where the same placement configuration can occur in different forms, leading to inefficiency in the search process as similar checks are repeatedly performed.

These invariants help identify potential slow paths in the code by focusing on the graph structure and its implications on the exhaustive search algorithm's performance.

### Phase 3: Implementing Checker Code in C++

Below are the C++ code snippets implementing the performance-characterizing invariants derived in natural language. Each invariant is transformed into a checker function using the template provided.

```cpp
void check_high_degree_invariant(const vector<vector<int>>& graph, int n) {
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        if (graph[i].size() > 4) {  // Consider a high degree to be greater than 4 for n ≤ 7
            cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high degree of vertices!" << endl;
            abort();
        }
    }
}

void check_dense_graph_invariant(int n, int m) {
    // A dense graph for n vertices would have close to n*(n-1)/2 edges
    if (m > (n * (n - 1)) / 3) {  // Use a fraction of the complete graph edges as a threshold
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - dense graph structure!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_symmetrical_configurations_invariant(const vector<vector<int>>& graph, int n) {
    // Check for symmetrical configurations, e.g., multiple identical subgraphs
    // This is a simplistic check; for illustration, assume symmetry if each vertex connects to the same number of other vertices
    int common_degree = graph[1].size();
    for (int i = 2; i <= n; ++i) {
        if (graph[i].size() != common_degree) {
            return;  // Not symmetrical, skip further check
        }
    }
    cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - symmetrical configurations!" << endl;
    abort();
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrating Checkers into the Original Program

Now, let's incorporate these checker functions into the original C++ program at strategic points in the code to detect potential slowdowns effectively.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Checker functions
void check_high_degree_invariant(const vector<vector<int>>& graph, int n) {
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        if (graph[i].size() > 4) {  // Consider a high degree to be greater than 4 for n ≤ 7
            cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high degree of vertices!" << endl;
            abort();
        }
    }
}

void check_dense_graph_invariant(int n, int m) {
    // A dense graph for n vertices would have close to n*(n-1)/2 edges
    if (m > (n * (n - 1)) / 3) {  // Use a fraction of the complete graph edges as a threshold
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - dense graph structure!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_symmetrical_configurations_invariant(const vector<vector<int>>& graph, int n) {
    // Check for symmetrical configurations, e.g., multiple identical subgraphs
    // This is a simplistic check; for illustration, assume symmetry if each vertex connects to the same number of other vertices
    int common_degree = graph[1].size();
    for (int i = 2; i <= n; ++i) {
        if (graph[i].size() != common_degree) {
            return;  // Not symmetrical, skip further check
        }
    }
    cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - symmetrical configurations!" << endl;
    abort();
}

int n, m;
int node[8];
vector<vector<int>> gr;

int countDom() {
    int dom[8][8];
    for (int i = 0; i < 8; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < 8; j++) dom[i][j] = 0;
    }
    int ans = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        for (int v : gr[i]) {
            if (!dom[node[i]][node[v]]) {
                dom[node[i]][node[v]] = dom[node[v]][node[i]] = 1;
                ans++;
            }
        }
    }
    if (ans == 21) {
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            cout << node[i] << " ";
        }
        cout << "\n";
    }
    return ans;
}

int solve() {
    int ans = 0;
    while (node[1] != 2) {
        int i = 7;
        ans = max(ans, countDom());
        while (++node[i] == 7) {
            node[i--] = 1;
        }
    }
    return ans;
}

int main() {
    cin >> n >> m;
    for (int i = 0; i < 8; i++) node[i] = 1;
    gr.resize(n + 1);
    for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
        int u, v;
        cin >> u >> v;
        gr[u].push_back(v);
        gr[v].push_back(u);
    }
    
    // Insert checks after graph construction
    check_high_degree_invariant(gr, n);  // Check for high degree vertices
    check_dense_graph_invariant(n, m);   // Check for dense graph structure
    check_symmetrical_configurations_invariant(gr, n);  // Check for symmetrical configurations
    
    cout << solve();
    cin >> n;
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

- **High Degree Invariant:** This is checked after constructing the graph (`gr`) to ensure no vertex has a degree higher than a reasonable threshold for a small graph size.
- **Dense Graph Invariant:** This is based on the number of edges (`m`) relative to the number of vertices (`n`). It ensures the graph doesn't approach the complete graph density, which can lead to performance issues.
- **Symmetrical Configurations Invariant:** This checks for identical degrees across all vertices, which is a simplistic way to detect possible symmetrical structures that can lead to redundant calculations. 

These checks aim to preemptively identify scenarios likely to cause performance degradation in the implemented algorithm, thereby assisting debugging and testing processes.
