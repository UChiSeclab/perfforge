system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

Anadi has a set of dominoes. Every domino has two parts, and each part contains some dots. For every a and b such that 1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 6, there is exactly one domino with a dots on one half and b dots on the other half. The set contains exactly 21 dominoes. Here is an exact illustration of his set:

<image>

Also, Anadi has an undirected graph without self-loops and multiple edges. He wants to choose some dominoes and place them on the edges of this graph. He can use at most one domino of each type. Each edge can fit at most one domino. It's not necessary to place a domino on each edge of the graph.

When placing a domino on an edge, he also chooses its direction. In other words, one half of any placed domino must be directed toward one of the endpoints of the edge and the other half must be directed toward the other endpoint. There's a catch: if there are multiple halves of dominoes directed toward the same vertex, each of these halves must contain the same number of dots.

How many dominoes at most can Anadi place on the edges of his graph?

Input

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 7, 0 ≤ m ≤ (n⋅(n-1))/(2)) — the number of vertices and the number of edges in the graph.

The next m lines contain two integers each. Integers in the i-th line are a_i and b_i (1 ≤ a, b ≤ n, a ≠ b) and denote that there is an edge which connects vertices a_i and b_i.

The graph might be disconnected. It's however guaranteed that the graph doesn't contain any self-loops, and that there is at most one edge between any pair of vertices.

Output

Output one integer which denotes the maximum number of dominoes which Anadi can place on the edges of the graph.

And here is one of the ways to place a domino on each of its edges:

Note that each vertex is faced by the halves of dominoes with the same number of dots. For instance, all halves directed toward vertex 1 have three dots.

assistant: ### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

#### Analysis of Hit Counts
1. **Nested Loops in `solve()` Function:**
   - The function `solve()` uses 7 nested loops (lines 37-43), each iterating 6 times, amounting to a total of \(6^7 = 279936\) iterations.
   - This approach is used to generate possible configurations for the `arr` array, representing the dots on vertices.

2. **Function `check()` Call:**
   - The `check()` function (line 18) is called 279936 times in both fast and slow inputs.
   - However, within `check()`, the line `for (int i = 0; i < m; i++)` (line 25) iterates over the edges. This loop is executed more times for the slow input (3079296 times) than for the fast input (1119744 times).

3. **Difference in Edge Count:**
   - The number of edges (`m`) is higher in the slow input. Specifically, the slow input has `m = 10`, while the fast input has `m = 3`.

#### Inefficient Code Segments
- **Combinatorial Explosion:**
  - The nested loops in `solve()` combined with the iteration over edges in `check()` lead to a combinatorial explosion, especially when there are more edges to process.
  
- **Repeated Edge Processing:**
  - The slow input's increased edge count causes significantly more iterations in the edge-processing loop (`for (int i = 0; i < m; i++)`), which is a major contributor to the slowdown.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

#### Invariant #1: Large Number of Edges
- **Natural Language Description:**
  - "If the graph contains a large number of edges relative to the number of vertices, such that the number of iterations in nested loops becomes excessive, the program may slow down significantly."
- **Explanation:**
  - When the number of edges (`m`) grows closer to its maximum possible value, it causes increased computations in the `check()` function, especially when combined with the exhaustive search by the nested loops.

#### Invariant #2: Inefficient Exhaustive Search
- **Natural Language Description:**
  - "If the exhaustive search approach in the nested loops is used without any pruning or optimization, the program may become inefficient for larger graphs, even within the given constraints."
- **Explanation:**
  - The current brute-force method explores all possible configurations, which is not efficient when combined with a larger graph. This inefficiency is exacerbated by not having any early exit conditions or pruning mechanisms.

#### Invariant #3: High Complexity of Iterations
- **Natural Language Description:**
  - "When the iteration complexity, due to a combination of high vertex and edge counts, exceeds a realistic threshold, the computation becomes prohibitively expensive."
- **Explanation:**
  - The multiplicative effect of nested loops and edge processing results in excessive computation times, especially as both `n` and `m` approach their upper limits.

These invariants collectively highlight that the primary cause of slowdown is the combination of large edge count and exhaustive permutations of vertex labels, leading to inefficiencies at the given input size constraints.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
Anadi has a set of dominoes. Every domino has two parts, and each part contains some dots. For every a and b such that 1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 6, there is exactly one domino with a dots on one half and b dots on the other half. The set contains exactly 21 dominoes. Here is an exact illustration of his set:

<image>

Also, Anadi has an undirected graph without self-loops and multiple edges. He wants to choose some dominoes and place them on the edges of this graph. He can use at most one domino of each type. Each edge can fit at most one domino. It's not necessary to place a domino on each edge of the graph.

When placing a domino on an edge, he also chooses its direction. In other words, one half of any placed domino must be directed toward one of the endpoints of the edge and the other half must be directed toward the other endpoint. There's a catch: if there are multiple halves of dominoes directed toward the same vertex, each of these halves must contain the same number of dots.

How many dominoes at most can Anadi place on the edges of his graph?

Input

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 7, 0 ≤ m ≤ (n⋅(n-1))/(2)) — the number of vertices and the number of edges in the graph.

The next m lines contain two integers each. Integers in the i-th line are a_i and b_i (1 ≤ a, b ≤ n, a ≠ b) and denote that there is an edge which connects vertices a_i and b_i.

The graph might be disconnected. It's however guaranteed that the graph doesn't contain any self-loops, and that there is at most one edge between any pair of vertices.

Output

Output one integer which denotes the maximum number of dominoes which Anadi can place on the edges of the graph.

Note

Here is an illustration of Anadi's graph from the first sample test:

And here is one of the ways to place a domino on each of its edges:

<image>

Note that each vertex is faced by the halves of dominoes with the same number of dots. For instance, all halves directed toward vertex 1 have three dots.

assistant: ### Phase 3: Implement the Natural Language Invariants in C++

Let's translate the natural language invariants into C++ runtime checks:

#### Invariant #1: Large Number of Edges
- **C++ Check:**
  - Since the problem constraints are small, we can set a threshold on `m` to detect when the graph becomes dense relative to the number of vertices. Given `1 ≤ n ≤ 7`, a high `m` can be a sign of potential slowdown.

```cpp
void check_large_edges(int n, int m) {
    if (m > (n * (n - 1)) / 3) { // arbitrary high density threshold
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large number of edges!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

#### Invariant #2: Inefficient Exhaustive Search
- **C++ Check:**
  - We need a check to ensure we are aware when the exhaustive search might become costly due to its combinatorial nature. We know the search space is \(6^7\) due to the nested loops.

```cpp
void check_exhaustive_search() {
    if (true) { // The check is primarily informational, to highlight the exhaustive search approach
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - inefficient exhaustive search!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

#### Invariant #3: High Complexity of Iterations
- **C++ Check:**
  - Detect when the combination of vertices (`n`) and edges (`m`) leads to excessive iterations. Here as well, we're more highlighting the complexity directly caused by nested loops and edge processing.

```cpp
void check_iteration_complexity(int n, int m) {
    if (m > 6 && n > 5) { // arbitrary condition to denote potential high complexity
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high iteration complexity!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrate the Checker Code into the Original Program

Now, let's integrate these checks into the original C++ program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
using ll = long long;
const ll inf = 1e18;
int n, m;
int edges[22][2];
bool used[6][6];
int arr[7];

void check_large_edges(int n, int m) {
    if (m > (n * (n - 1)) / 3) { // arbitrary high density threshold
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large number of edges!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_exhaustive_search() {
    if (true) { // The check is primarily informational, to highlight the exhaustive search approach
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - inefficient exhaustive search!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_iteration_complexity(int n, int m) {
    if (m > 6 && n > 5) { // arbitrary condition to denote potential high complexity
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high iteration complexity!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void init() {}

void input() {
    cin >> n >> m;
    check_large_edges(n, m); // Check for large number of edges
    check_iteration_complexity(n, m); // Check high iteration complexity
    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        cin >> edges[i][0] >> edges[i][1];
        edges[i][0]--;
        edges[i][1]--;
    }
}

int check() {
    int now = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= 6; i++) {
        for (int j = 1; j <= 6; j++) {
            used[i][j] = false;
        }
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        int v = edges[i][0], u = edges[i][1];
        if (!used[arr[v]][arr[u]]) {
            now++;
            used[arr[v]][arr[u]] = true;
            used[arr[u]][arr[v]] = true;
        }
    }
    return now;
}

void solve() {
    check_exhaustive_search(); // Check for inefficient exhaustive search
    int ans = 0;
    for (arr[0] = 1; arr[0] < 7; arr[0]++) {
        for (arr[1] = 1; arr[1] < 7; arr[1]++) {
            for (arr[2] = 1; arr[2] < 7; arr[2]++) {
                for (arr[3] = 1; arr[3] < 7; arr[3]++) {
                    for (arr[4] = 1; arr[4] < 7; arr[4]++) {
                        for (arr[5] = 1; arr[5] < 7; arr[5]++) {
                            for (arr[6] = 1; arr[6] < 7; arr[6]++) {
                                ans = max(ans, check());
                            }
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
    cout << ans << endl;
}

void output() {}

int main() {
    ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(0);
    int number_of_testcases = 1;
    while (number_of_testcases--) {
        init();
        input();
        solve();
        output();
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

- **Checking Large Number of Edges:** The function `check_large_edges` is called right after reading the input values for `n` and `m`. It detects if the graph is dense with edges, which could lead to slow performance.
  
- **Exhaustive Search Warning:** The `check_exhaustive_search` function is called at the start of the `solve` function to provide an alert about the inherent inefficiency of the exhaustive search method.

- **High Complexity Check:** `check_iteration_complexity` is invoked immediately after input to ensure that the combination of graph parameters doesn't lead to excessive computational complexity. 

These checks help identify scenarios that could lead to performance bottlenecks in this program when the input constraints are approached.
