### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

From analyzing the hit count data, the key differences between the slow and fast inputs are:

1. **Line 37** (`for (j = 0; j < m; j++)`): This line shows a high increase in hits for the slow input compared to the fast input, indicating that this loop is a significant contributor to the slowdown. Specifically, the more edges (`m`) there are, the more times this loop is executed.
   
2. **Lines 38-44**: These lines inside the loop show a similar increase in hit counts, suggesting that the operations on the adjacency list and the nested maps are computationally expensive, especially when `m` is large.

3. **Interaction with Permutations**: The loop over permutations (`for (i = 0; i < v.size(); i++)`) has consistent hits between the fast and slow inputs, but as it scales with the combinatorial complexity of all possible permutations of domino orientations, its impact combined with the inner loops is substantial.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the above analysis, here are some natural language performance-characterizing invariants:

1. **Excessive Edge Combinations**:
   - Natural language description: "When the number of edges `m` is near its upper limit and there are many permutations to consider, the nested loop operations on each edge become costly."
   - This suggests that when the graph is dense (many edges) and the permutations are fully explored, the operations become quadratically expensive.

2. **Permutation Overhead**:
   - Natural language description: "If the graph has a high number of possible edge connections, the exhaustive exploration of permutations results in a large number of repeated operations."
   - This suggests that even with the constraints `n <= 7`, the combination of nodes and edges can push the permutation operations to be expensive.

3. **Graph Density**:
   - Natural language description: "In graphs where `m` approaches its maximum value relative to `n`, handling the adjacency list per permutation substantially increases computational demand."
   - This reflects the role of graph density in determining how heavily the permutation space is exploited, impacting performance.

4. **Redundant Checks in Dense Graphs**:
   - Natural language description: "Dense graphs with many connections result in repetitive checks within inner loops, especially when using nested data structures like maps for each permutation."
   - This captures the inefficiency of the nested map operations when multiplied by both high `m` and the permutation count.

These performance-characterizing invariants provide insight into conditions that may cause the C program to slow down, especially when dealing with dense graphs and extensive permutations of domino placements.

Phase 3: Implementing Performance-Characterizing Invariants as C++ Checkers

Below are the C++ checkers based on the performance-characterizing invariants derived in the previous phase.

```cpp
void check_edge_permutation_invariant(int n, int m, size_t v_size) {
    // Invariant 1: Excessive Edge Combinations
    if (m > n * (n - 1) / 4 && v_size > 30000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive edge combinations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_permutation_overhead_invariant(int m, size_t v_size) {
    // Invariant 2: Permutation Overhead
    if (m > 10 && v_size > 30000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - permutation overhead!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_graph_density_invariant(int m, int n) {
    // Invariant 3: Graph Density
    if (m == n * (n - 1) / 2) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high graph density!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_redundant_checks_invariant(int m, size_t v_size) {
    // Invariant 4: Redundant Checks in Dense Graphs
    if (m > 15 && v_size > 30000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - redundant checks in dense graphs!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

Phase 4: Integrating the Checkers with the Original C++ Code

Now, let's integrate these checkers into the original C++ code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

vector<string> v;
vector<pair<int, int> > adj;
int n, m;

void f(int i, string str) {
    if (i == 7) {
        v.push_back(str);
        return;
    }
    for (int j = i; j < 7; j++) {
        swap(str[i], str[j]);
        f(i + 1, str);
        swap(str[i], str[j]);
    }
}

// Checker functions based on performance-characterizing invariants
void check_edge_permutation_invariant(int n, int m, size_t v_size) {
    if (m > n * (n - 1) / 4 && v_size > 30000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive edge combinations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_permutation_overhead_invariant(int m, size_t v_size) {
    if (m > 10 && v_size > 30000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - permutation overhead!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_graph_density_invariant(int m, int n) {
    if (m == n * (n - 1) / 2) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high graph density!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_redundant_checks_invariant(int m, size_t v_size) {
    if (m > 15 && v_size > 30000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - redundant checks in dense graphs!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    string abc = "0123456";
    for (int i = 1; i <= 6; i++) {
        abc[0] = 48 + i;
        f(0, abc);
    }

    cin >> n >> m;
    int i, j, a, b;
    for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        cin >> a >> b;
        adj.push_back({a, b});
    }

    // Place the checkers after input and permutation generation
    check_edge_permutation_invariant(n, m, v.size());
    check_permutation_overhead_invariant(m, v.size());
    check_graph_density_invariant(m, n);
    check_redundant_checks_invariant(m, v.size());

    int ans = 0;
    for (i = 0; i < v.size(); i++) {
        map<int, map<int, int> > vis;
        int an = 0;
        int arr[8] = {0};
        for (int k = 1; k < 8; k++) {
            arr[k] = v[i][k - 1] - '0';
        }
        for (j = 0; j < m; j++) {
            int a = arr[adj[j].first];
            int b = arr[adj[j].second];
            int A = min(a, b);
            int B = max(a, b);
            if (vis[A][B] == 0) {
                an++;
                vis[A][B] = 1;
            }
        }
        ans = max(an, ans);
    }
    cout << ans;
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:

- **Checker Placement**: Checkers are placed after the inputs are read and the permutations are generated, ensuring they don't interfere with the primary loop execution and focus on detecting pre-loop conditions that indicate potential slow paths.
- **Checker Conditions**: Each invariant checks for specific conditions that can lead to performance bottlenecks, triggering a warning and aborting execution if they are met. These are based on graph density, edge permutations, and redundant checks.
- **Thresholds**: The thresholds used in checkers are derived from logical estimations considering the upper limits of n and m, ensuring they capture the essence of identified bottleneck scenarios without being tied to specific input values.
