system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

In Chelyabinsk lives a much respected businessman Nikita with a strange nickname "Boss". Once Nikita decided to go with his friend Alex to the Summer Biathlon World Cup. Nikita, as a very important person, received a token which allows to place bets on each section no more than on one competitor.

To begin with friends learned the rules: in the race there are n sections of equal length and m participants. The participants numbered from 1 to m. About each participant the following is known:

  * li — the number of the starting section, 
  * ri — the number of the finishing section (li ≤ ri),
  * ti — the time a biathlete needs to complete an section of the path,
  * ci — the profit in roubles. If the i-th sportsman wins on one of the sections, the profit will be given to the man who had placed a bet on that sportsman.



The i-th biathlete passes the sections from li to ri inclusive. The competitor runs the whole way in (ri - li + 1)·ti time units. It takes him exactly ti time units to pass each section. In case of the athlete's victory on k sections the man who has betted on him receives k·ci roubles.

In each section the winner is determined independently as follows: if there is at least one biathlete running this in this section, then among all of them the winner is the one who has ran this section in minimum time (spent minimum time passing this section). In case of equality of times the athlete with the smaller index number wins. If there are no participants in this section, then the winner in this section in not determined. We have to say that in the summer biathlon all the participants are moving at a constant speed.

We should also add that Nikita can bet on each section and on any contestant running in this section.

Help the friends find the maximum possible profit.

Input

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100). Then follow m lines, each containing 4 integers li, ri, ti, ci (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ n, 1 ≤ ti, ci ≤ 1000).

Output

Print a single integer, the maximal profit in roubles that the friends can get. In each of n sections it is not allowed to place bets on more than one sportsman.

Note

In the first test the optimal bet is: in the 1-2 sections on biathlete 1, in section 3 on biathlete 3, in section 4 on biathlete 4. Total: profit of 5 rubles for 1 section, the profit of 5 rubles for 2 section, profit of 30 rubles for a 3 section, profit of 20 rubles for 4 section. Total profit 60 rubles.

In the second test the optimal bet is: on 1 and 5 sections on biathlete 1, in the 2-4 sections on biathlete 2, in the 6-7 sections on athlete 4. There is no winner in the 8 section. Total: profit of 10 rubles for 1 section, the profit of 15 rubles for 2,3,4 section, profit of 10 rubles for a 5 section, profit of 20 rubles for 6, 7 section. Total profit 105 rubles.

assistant: To diagnose the performance bottlenecks in the given C program, we need to analyze the line-level hit counts for both the slow and fast inputs. Below are the steps for Phases 1 and 2:

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Line-Level Hit Counts Analysis**
   - The `comp` function (lines 9-14) is hit significantly more often in the slow input, with 686 hits compared to only 6 hits in the fast input. This suggests that sorting operations are a key factor in the slowdown.
   - Specifically, line 11 and line 12 within the `comp` function are also heavily hit, indicating frequent comparisons between elements.
   - Line 33, where the sorting function is called, is hit 20 times in the slow input compared to 8 times in the fast input.

2. **Inference**
   - The frequent sorting operation suggests that the vector `v[i]` for each section `i` is being sorted multiple times, which becomes costly when the number of participants `m` and the range `li` to `ri` for each participant are large.
   - Analyzing the construction of `v[j]` in the nested loop on lines 27-28, the hit counts are much higher in the slow input, indicating more elements are added to each vector, leading to more expensive sorting operations.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the observations from Phase 1, we can derive the following performance-characterizing invariants in natural language:

1. **Sorting Overhead:**
   - _Invariant:_ "When there are many participants and each participant competes in a large number of sections, the sorting operation for determining the winner in each section can become a significant performance bottleneck."
   - _Condition:_ The total number of elements in vectors `v[i]` is high due to overlapping sections, exacerbating the sorting cost.

2. **Frequent Use of Overlapping Sections:**
   - _Invariant:_ "If participants have overlapping sections that result in a high number of comparisons to determine the winner, the performance can degrade significantly."
   - _Condition:_ When the range `li` to `ri` for multiple participants covers many sections, leading to increased size of `v[j]`.

3. **High Range Utilization:**
   - _Invariant:_ "If many participants compete across almost all sections (li close to 1 and ri close to n), the program can experience slow execution due to repeated sorting and comparison operations."
   - _Condition:_ High overlap in participant sections, especially when `li` is small and `ri` is large for many participants, leading to complex sorting scenarios.

These invariants aim to abstractly represent the conditions leading to slower execution based on the input patterns, without relying on specific numeric values from the provided slow input.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
In Chelyabinsk lives a much respected businessman Nikita with a strange nickname "Boss". Once Nikita decided to go with his friend Alex to the Summer Biathlon World Cup. Nikita, as a very important person, received a token which allows to place bets on each section no more than on one competitor.

  * ti — the time a biathlete needs to complete an section of the path,
  * ci — the profit in roubles. If the i-th sportsman wins on one of the sections, the profit will be given to the man who had placed a bet on that sportsman.



The i-th biathlete passes the sections from li to ri inclusive. The competitor runs the whole way in (ri - li + 1)·ti time units. It takes him exactly ti time units to pass each section. In case of the athlete's victory on k sections the man who has betted on him receives k·ci roubles.

We have to say that in the summer biathlon all the participants are moving at a constant speed.

We should also add that Nikita can bet on each section and on any contestant running in this section.

Help the friends find the maximum possible profit.

Input

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100). Then follow m lines, each containing 4 integers li, ri, ti, ci (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ n, 1 ≤ ti, ci ≤ 1000).

Output

Print a single integer, the maximal profit in roubles that the friends can get. In each of n sections it is not allowed to place bets on more than one sportsman.

assistant: ### Phase 3: Implementing the Natural Language Invariants in C++

Here are the checker functions implemented in C++ based on the performance-characterizing invariants derived earlier:

1. **Sorting Overhead Check:**

```cpp
void check_sorting_overhead(int sectionsCount, int participants) {
    // If the total number of elements in the vectors for each section is high, it could lead to costly sorting.
    if (sectionsCount * participants > 1000) { // A threshold chosen based on n, m limits
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck - high sorting overhead due to large number of elements across sections!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

2. **Frequent Use of Overlapping Sections Check:**

```cpp
void check_overlapping_sections(const vector<int>& sectionSizes) {
    int threshold = 15; // A chosen threshold for this problem
    for (int size : sectionSizes) {
        if (size > threshold) {
            cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck - excessive overlap in sections leading to high comparison operations!" << endl;
            abort();
        }
    }
}
```

3. **High Range Utilization Check:**

```cpp
void check_high_range_utilization(const vector<par> competitors, int n) {
    int highRangeThreshold = 0.75 * n; // If most competitors utilize a large section range
    for (const auto& competitor : competitors) {
        if ((competitor.id == 1 || competitor.id == n) && (competitor.time > highRangeThreshold)) {
            cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck - high range utilization by a large number of competitors!" << endl;
            abort();
        }
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Propagating and Inserting Conditional Checks into Original C++ Program

Now, let's integrate these performance checks into the original program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

struct par {
    int time;
    int id;
    int profit;
};

bool comp(const par &p1, const par &p2) {
    if (p1.time < p2.time) return true;
    if (p1.time == p2.time) {
        return p1.id < p2.id;
    }
    return false;
}

void check_sorting_overhead(int sectionsCount, int participants) {
    if (sectionsCount * participants > 1000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck - high sorting overhead due to large number of elements across sections!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_overlapping_sections(const vector<int>& sectionSizes) {
    int threshold = 15;
    for (int size : sectionSizes) {
        if (size > threshold) {
            cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck - excessive overlap in sections leading to high comparison operations!" << endl;
            abort();
        }
    }
}

void check_high_range_utilization(const vector<par> competitors, int n) {
    int highRangeThreshold = 0.75 * n;
    for (const auto& competitor : competitors) {
        if ((competitor.id == 1 || competitor.id == n) && (competitor.time > highRangeThreshold)) {
            cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck - high range utilization by a large number of competitors!" << endl;
            abort();
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    vector<par> v[120];
    par p;
    int n, m;
    int l, r, t, c;
    cin >> n >> m;
    
    vector<int> sectionSizes(n+1, 0);
    vector<par> competitors;
    
    for (int i = 1; i <= m; ++i) {
        cin >> l >> r >> t >> c;
        p.id = i;
        p.time = t;
        p.profit = c;
        competitors.push_back(p);
        for (int j = l; j <= r; ++j) {
            v[j].push_back(p);
            sectionSizes[j]++;
        }
    }

    check_sorting_overhead(n, m);
    check_overlapping_sections(sectionSizes);
    check_high_range_utilization(competitors, n);

    int res = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        sort((v[i]).begin(), (v[i]).end(), comp);
        if (v[i].size() > 0) {
            res += v[i][0].profit;
        }
    }
    cout << res << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

- The **check_sorting_overhead** function is called immediately after input is read to ensure that sorting operations won't be overly expensive.
- **check_overlapping_sections** verifies that no section has an excessive number of competitors that would lead to high comparison costs.
- **check_high_range_utilization** checks for the utilization of large ranges by many competitors, which could indicate excessive overlapping.
- These checks are inserted to catch potential performance bottlenecks before the main computation loop.
