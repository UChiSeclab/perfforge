system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

In Chelyabinsk lives a much respected businessman Nikita with a strange nickname "Boss". Once Nikita decided to go with his friend Alex to the Summer Biathlon World Cup. Nikita, as a very important person, received a token which allows to place bets on each section no more than on one competitor.

To begin with friends learned the rules: in the race there are n sections of equal length and m participants. The participants numbered from 1 to m. About each participant the following is known:

  * li — the number of the starting section, 
  * ri — the number of the finishing section (li ≤ ri),
  * ti — the time a biathlete needs to complete an section of the path,
  * ci — the profit in roubles. If the i-th sportsman wins on one of the sections, the profit will be given to the man who had placed a bet on that sportsman.



The i-th biathlete passes the sections from li to ri inclusive. The competitor runs the whole way in (ri - li + 1)·ti time units. It takes him exactly ti time units to pass each section. In case of the athlete's victory on k sections the man who has betted on him receives k·ci roubles.

In each section the winner is determined independently as follows: if there is at least one biathlete running this in this section, then among all of them the winner is the one who has ran this section in minimum time (spent minimum time passing this section). In case of equality of times the athlete with the smaller index number wins. If there are no participants in this section, then the winner in this section in not determined. We have to say that in the summer biathlon all the participants are moving at a constant speed.

We should also add that Nikita can bet on each section and on any contestant running in this section.

Help the friends find the maximum possible profit.

Input

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100). Then follow m lines, each containing 4 integers li, ri, ti, ci (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ n, 1 ≤ ti, ci ≤ 1000).

Output

Print a single integer, the maximal profit in roubles that the friends can get. In each of n sections it is not allowed to place bets on more than one sportsman.

Note

In the first test the optimal bet is: in the 1-2 sections on biathlete 1, in section 3 on biathlete 3, in section 4 on biathlete 4. Total: profit of 5 rubles for 1 section, the profit of 5 rubles for 2 section, profit of 30 rubles for a 3 section, profit of 20 rubles for 4 section. Total profit 60 rubles.

In the second test the optimal bet is: on 1 and 5 sections on biathlete 1, in the 2-4 sections on biathlete 2, in the 6-7 sections on athlete 4. There is no winner in the 8 section. Total: profit of 10 rubles for 1 section, the profit of 15 rubles for 2,3,4 section, profit of 10 rubles for a 5 section, profit of 20 rubles for 6, 7 section. Total profit 105 rubles.

assistant: To diagnose the performance bottlenecks in the provided C code, let's follow the tasks outlined in the prompt:

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Compare Line-Level Hit Counts:**
   - The `while` loop on line 39 has a significantly higher hit count for the slow input (58,162) compared to the fast input (7,999).
   - The nested `for` loop on line 40 and the corresponding operations within it, particularly `comp[i].timeNow++` on line 41 and the condition check on line 42, are executed significantly more times for the slow input.

2. **Pinpoint Lines or Functions with Higher Hits:**
   - The lines responsible for updating `comp[i].timeNow` and checking `comp[i].finished` indicate heavy usage within the `while` loop.
   - Lines 43-53 show the logic for determining section winners and advancing competitors, contributing to the higher execution count under the slow input.

3. **Infer Interaction with Data Structures and Control Flow:**
   - The primary loop iterates over all competitors for as long as there are unfinished competitors (`finM < m`), updating their `timeNow`, checking if they should proceed to the next section or declare themselves finished.
   - The code's logic heavily involves updating competitor states based on their starting and ending sections, and this logic is influenced by the initial setup in lines 29-35.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **Generate Natural Language Statements:**
   - "If a competitor starts running from an early section and the number of sections they run is large, the program may enter a slow path due to extended loop iterations for time updates and section checks."
   - "When the start section of a competitor is near the beginning and spans a long range of sections, the likelihood of extended execution time increases due to repeated competitive checks over a larger number of sections."

2. **Avoid Exact Numeric Values; Use Abstract Conditions:**
   - Instead of relying on exact values from the input, we focus on conditions: competitors with `li` near 1 and `(ri - li + 1)` large relative to `n` cause more iterations.

3. **Correlate with Input Patterns:**
   - The slow execution is correlated with competitors whose range of sections (`ri - li + 1`) is large, requiring many updates in the `while` loop.
   - This pattern is exacerbated when `li` is small, resulting in the competitor being active over the entire race, leading to repeated updates and checks in multiple sections.

4. **Set Realistic Triggers:**
   - "If the start section is significantly lower than the end section, causing a large number of sections to be traversed, performance may degrade due to increased computations."

### Final Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **Invariant 1:**
   - "When a competitor starts from an early section and covers a large number of sections, this can result in increased processing time due to repetitive state updates and section evaluations."

2. **Invariant 2:**
   - "If the starting section is near the beginning and the range of sections (`ri - li + 1`) is large, it can lead to a slowdown as the competitor remains active across many sections for a prolonged period."

These invariants are designed to help identify when the program is likely to experience slow execution due to input characteristics, without relying on specific numeric values.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
In Chelyabinsk lives a much respected businessman Nikita with a strange nickname "Boss". Once Nikita decided to go with his friend Alex to the Summer Biathlon World Cup. Nikita, as a very important person, received a token which allows to place bets on each section no more than on one competitor.

To begin with friends learned the rules: in the race there are n sections of equal length and m participants. The participants numbered from 1 to m. About each participant the following is known:

  * li — the number of the starting section, 
  * ri — the number of the finishing section (li ≤ ri),
  * ti — the time a biathlete needs to complete an section of the path,
  * ci — the profit in roubles. If the i-th sportsman wins on one of the sections, the profit will be given to the man who had placed a bet on that sportsman.



The i-th biathlete passes the sections from li to ri inclusive. The competitor runs the whole way in (ri - li + 1)·ti time units. It takes him exactly ti time units to pass each section. In case of the athlete's victory on k sections the man who has betted on him receives k·ci roubles.

In each section the winner is determined independently as follows: if there is at least one biathlete running this in this section, then among all of them the winner is the one who has ran this section in minimum time (spent minimum time passing this section). In case of equality of times the athlete with the smaller index number wins. If there are no participants in this section, then the winner in this section in not determined. We have to say that in the summer biathlon all the participants are moving at a constant speed.

We should also add that Nikita can bet on each section and on any contestant running in this section.

Help the friends find the maximum possible profit.

Input

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100). Then follow m lines, each containing 4 integers li, ri, ti, ci (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ n, 1 ≤ ti, ci ≤ 1000).

Output

Print a single integer, the maximal profit in roubles that the friends can get. In each of n sections it is not allowed to place bets on more than one sportsman.

Examples

Input

4 4
1 4 20 5
1 3 21 10
3 3 4 30
3 4 4 20


Output

60

Input

8 4
1 5 24 10
2 4 6 15
4 6 30 50
6 7 4 20


Output

105

Note

In the first test the optimal bet is: in the 1-2 sections on biathlete 1, in section 3 on biathlete 3, in section 4 on biathlete 4. Total: profit of 5 rubles for 1 section, the profit of 5 rubles for 2 section, profit of 30 rubles for a 3 section, profit of 20 rubles for 4 section. Total profit 60 rubles.

In the second test the optimal bet is: on 1 and 5 sections on biathlete 1, in the 2-4 sections on biathlete 2, in the 6-7 sections on athlete 4. There is no winner in the 8 section. Total: profit of 10 rubles for 1 section, the profit of 15 rubles for 2,3,4 section, profit of 10 rubles for a 5 section, profit of 20 rubles for 6, 7 section. Total profit 105 rubles.

assistant: ### Phase 3: Implement the Natural Language Invariants in C++

Let's translate the previously inferred natural language performance-characterizing invariants into C++ code:

1. **Invariant 1:**
   - **Natural Language:** When a competitor starts from an early section and covers a large number of sections, this can result in increased processing time due to repetitive state updates and section evaluations.
   
   ```cpp
   void check_competitor_range_invariant(int startSection, int endSection, int totalSections) {
       if (startSection <= 10 && (endSection - startSection + 1) >= totalSections / 2) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - competitor covers a large range starting early!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Invariant 2:**
   - **Natural Language:** If the starting section is near the beginning and the range of sections (`ri - li + 1`) is large, it can lead to a slowdown as the competitor remains active across many sections for a prolonged period.
   
   ```cpp
   void check_large_active_range_invariant(int startSection, int range, int totalSections) {
       if (startSection <= 10 && range >= totalSections / 2) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large active range from early section!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Integrate Checkers into the Original Program

Now, let's integrate these checks into the provided C++ program. We will place the checks at strategic points to ensure they do not add unnecessary overhead within tight loops:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

struct Competitor {
    int start;
    int end;
    int time;
    int profit;
    int timeNow;
    int secNow;
    int id;
    bool finished;
};

struct Section {
    int compid;
};

Competitor comp[102];
Section sec[102];

// Checker Function for Performance Bottlenecks
void check_competitor_range_invariant(int startSection, int endSection, int totalSections) {
    if (startSection <= 10 && (endSection - startSection + 1) >= totalSections / 2) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - competitor covers a large range starting early!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    int n, m, i, j, finM(0), s(0);
    cin >> n >> m;

    // Add a check for performance bottleneck based on competitor ranges
    for (i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
        cin >> comp[i].start >> comp[i].end >> comp[i].time >> comp[i].profit;
        comp[i].timeNow = 0;
        comp[i].secNow = comp[i].start;
        comp[i].id = i;
        comp[i].finished = false;

        // Check for performance bottleneck conditions
        check_competitor_range_invariant(comp[i].start, comp[i].end, n);
    }

    comp[m + 1].start = 0;
    comp[m + 1].end = 0;
    comp[m + 1].time = 1001;
    comp[m + 1].profit = 0;
    comp[m + 1].timeNow = 0;
    comp[m + 1].secNow = 0;
    comp[m + 1].id = m + 1;
    comp[m + 1].finished = true;

    for (i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        sec[i].compid = m + 1;
    }

    while (finM < m) {
        for (i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
            comp[i].timeNow++;
            if (comp[i].timeNow > comp[i].time && !comp[i].finished) {
                comp[i].timeNow = 1;
                if ((comp[i].time < comp[sec[comp[i].secNow].compid].time ||
                     comp[i].time == comp[sec[comp[i].secNow].compid].time &&
                     i < sec[comp[i].secNow].compid) &&
                    sec[comp[i].secNow].compid && comp[i].secNow <= n) {
                    sec[comp[i].secNow].compid = i;
                }
                comp[i].secNow++;
                if (comp[i].secNow > comp[i].end) {
                    comp[i].finished = true;
                    finM++;
                }
            }
        }
    }

    for (i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        s += comp[sec[i].compid].profit;
    }
    cout << s << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**
- **Check Placement:** The check is placed after reading input for each competitor. This ensures that we do not introduce overhead in the main loop, but still flag conditions that could lead to slow execution.
- **Check Functionality:** The checks are based on the competitors' starting section and the number of sections they cover, which was determined to be a condition related to slow performance.
