system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

In Chelyabinsk lives a much respected businessman Nikita with a strange nickname "Boss". Once Nikita decided to go with his friend Alex to the Summer Biathlon World Cup. Nikita, as a very important person, received a token which allows to place bets on each section no more than on one competitor.

To begin with friends learned the rules: in the race there are n sections of equal length and m participants. The participants numbered from 1 to m. About each participant the following is known:

  * li — the number of the starting section, 
  * ri — the number of the finishing section (li ≤ ri),
  * ti — the time a biathlete needs to complete an section of the path,
  * ci — the profit in roubles. If the i-th sportsman wins on one of the sections, the profit will be given to the man who had placed a bet on that sportsman.



The i-th biathlete passes the sections from li to ri inclusive. The competitor runs the whole way in (ri - li + 1)·ti time units. It takes him exactly ti time units to pass each section. In case of the athlete's victory on k sections the man who has betted on him receives k·ci roubles.

In each section the winner is determined independently as follows: if there is at least one biathlete running this in this section, then among all of them the winner is the one who has ran this section in minimum time (spent minimum time passing this section). In case of equality of times the athlete with the smaller index number wins. If there are no participants in this section, then the winner in this section in not determined. We have to say that in the summer biathlon all the participants are moving at a constant speed.

We should also add that Nikita can bet on each section and on any contestant running in this section.

Help the friends find the maximum possible profit.

Input

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100). Then follow m lines, each containing 4 integers li, ri, ti, ci (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ n, 1 ≤ ti, ci ≤ 1000).

Output

Print a single integer, the maximal profit in roubles that the friends can get. In each of n sections it is not allowed to place bets on more than one sportsman.

Note

In the first test the optimal bet is: in the 1-2 sections on biathlete 1, in section 3 on biathlete 3, in section 4 on biathlete 4. Total: profit of 5 rubles for 1 section, the profit of 5 rubles for 2 section, profit of 30 rubles for a 3 section, profit of 20 rubles for 4 section. Total profit 60 rubles.

In the second test the optimal bet is: on 1 and 5 sections on biathlete 1, in the 2-4 sections on biathlete 2, in the 6-7 sections on athlete 4. There is no winner in the 8 section. Total: profit of 10 rubles for 1 section, the profit of 15 rubles for 2,3,4 section, profit of 10 rubles for a 5 section, profit of 20 rubles for 6, 7 section. Total profit 105 rubles.

assistant: To diagnose the performance bottleneck in the provided C program, we must first analyze the hit counts of each line of code when run with both the "fast" and "slow" inputs. The goal is to identify which segments of the code are significantly more active during the "slow" run and understand why they contribute to the slower execution.

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Comparison of Hit Counts**:
   - The `comp` function (lines 6-12) is called significantly more often in the slow input run (686 times) compared to the fast input run (5 times). This indicates that sorting operations within the program are a major contributor to the slowdown.
   - The inner loop (lines 24-25) and subsequent sorting operations (line 33) are key areas where performance differences are evident. The inner loop executes 223 times in the slow input versus 15 times in the fast input.
   - Sorting operations (line 33) are called 20 times in the slow input and only 7 times in the fast input.

2. **Analysis**:
   - The higher frequency of sorting operations suggests that the number of elements being sorted per section is significantly larger for the slow input.
   - The comp function is heavily utilized, indicating that there might be many comparisons needed due to a large number of athletes participating in the same sections.

3. **Data Structure Interactions**:
   - The program uses a vector of vectors `v` to store tuples (each representing an athlete's time, index, and profit) for each section. The performance degradation likely arises from the need to sort these vectors frequently.
   - If more athletes compete in overlapping sections, it leads to larger vectors that require more costly sorting operations.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **Performance Invariant #1**:
   - **Natural Language Description**: "If many athletes are competing in overlapping sections, leading to large vectors per section that require extensive sorting, the program may experience significant slowdowns. Specifically, if the number of athletes in any section is high, sorting operations become a bottleneck."
   
2. **Performance Invariant #2**:
   - **Natural Language Description**: "When the overall number of sorting operations per section increases, the cumulative effect of sorting leads to performance degradation. Observing many athletes with overlapping ranges can lead to this scenario."

3. **Performance Invariant #3**:
   - **Natural Language Description**: "The program slows down when sections have a high density of athlete overlap, causing repeated sorting and comparison operations. The slowdown is particularly evident when the program's logic must frequently resolve ties by athlete indices due to similar completion times."

These invariants capture the essence of the slow path in the code. By highlighting scenarios where sorting operations become excessive due to overlapping athlete participation across sections, they provide insight into performance triggers without relying on specific input values.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:

Note

In the first test the optimal bet is: in the 1-2 sections on biathlete 1, in section 3 on biathlete 3, in section 4 on biathlete 4. Total: profit of 5 rubles for 1 section, the profit of 5 rubles for 2 section, profit of 30 rubles for a 3 section, profit of 20 rubles for 4 section. Total profit 60 rubles.

In the second test the optimal bet is: on 1 and 5 sections on biathlete 1, in the 2-4 sections on biathlete 2, in the 6-7 sections on athlete 4. There is no winner in the 8 section. Total: profit of 10 rubles for 1 section, the profit of 15 rubles for 2,3,4 section, profit of 10 rubles for a 5 section, profit of 20 rubles for 6, 7 section. Total profit 105 rubles.

assistant: ### Phase 3: Implement the Natural Language Invariants in C++

Based on the previously inferred performance-characterizing invariants, let's translate them into C++ code to serve as runtime checks.

#### Invariant #1
- **Natural Language**: If many athletes are competing in overlapping sections, leading to large vectors per section that require extensive sorting, the program may experience significant slowdowns.
- **C++ Checker**:
```cpp
void check_large_vector_invariant(int vectorSize) {
    if (vectorSize > 20) { // Threshold based on experience, considering n, m <= 100
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large vector size for sorting!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

#### Invariant #2
- **Natural Language**: When the overall number of sorting operations per section increases, the cumulative effect of sorting leads to performance degradation.
- **C++ Checker**:
```cpp
void check_frequent_sorting_invariant(int sortCount) {
    if (sortCount > 10) { // Arbitrary threshold indicating frequent sorting for n sections
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - frequent sorting!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

#### Invariant #3
- **Natural Language**: The program slows down when sections have a high density of athlete overlap.
- **C++ Checker**:
```cpp
void check_athlete_overlap_invariant(int overlapCount) {
    if (overlapCount > 30) { // Threshold for high athlete overlap
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high athlete overlap!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrate Checker Code into the Original Program

Now, we will integrate these checker functions into the provided C++ program at appropriate points.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

struct athlete {
    int l, r, t, c;
};

bool comp(tuple<int, int, int> t1, tuple<int, int, int> t2) {
    if (get<0>(t1) < get<0>(t2)) {
        return 1;
    } else if (get<0>(t1) == get<0>(t2) && get<1>(t1) < get<1>(t2)) {
        return 1;
    }
    return 0;
}

// Checker functions
void check_large_vector_invariant(int vectorSize) {
    if (vectorSize > 20) { // Threshold based on experience, considering n, m <= 100
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large vector size for sorting!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_frequent_sorting_invariant(int sortCount) {
    if (sortCount > 10) { // Arbitrary threshold indicating frequent sorting for n sections
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - frequent sorting!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_athlete_overlap_invariant(int overlapCount) {
    if (overlapCount > 30) { // Threshold for high athlete overlap
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high athlete overlap!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    int n, m;
    cin >> n >> m;
    athlete arr[105];
    for (int i = 1; i <= m; ++i) {
        cin >> arr[i].l >> arr[i].r >> arr[i].t >> arr[i].c;
    }

    vector<vector<tuple<int, int, int>>> v(102, vector<tuple<int, int, int>>());
    int totalOverlap = 0; // To track total athlete overlap

    for (int i = 1; i <= m; ++i) {
        for (int j = arr[i].l; j <= arr[i].r; ++j) {
            v[j].push_back(make_tuple(arr[i].t, i, arr[i].c));
        }
    }

    int sortCount = 0; // To track the number of sorting operations
    int c = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        int vectorSize = v[i].size();
        
        // Check for large vector size in each section
        check_large_vector_invariant(vectorSize);

        if (vectorSize == 0) {
            continue;
        }
        
        sort(v[i].begin(), v[i].end(), comp);
        sortCount++;

        // Check for frequent sorting operations
        check_frequent_sorting_invariant(sortCount);

        c += get<2>(v[i][0]);
        
        totalOverlap += vectorSize;
    }

    // Check for high athlete overlap across sections
    check_athlete_overlap_invariant(totalOverlap);

    cout << c << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Comments on the Inserted Checks

1. **Large Vector Size Check**: Placed before sorting each vector `v[i]` to ensure we detect when the size becomes a bottleneck.
2. **Frequent Sorting Check**: Counts the number of times sorting is performed and issues a warning if it's excessive.
3. **Athlete Overlap Check**: Aggregates the number of total overlaps and checks for high athlete overlap. This identifies if there's a dense concentration of athletes competing across sections.

These checks help identify performance bottlenecks and should provide useful feedback during testing or fuzzing.
