system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

In Chelyabinsk lives a much respected businessman Nikita with a strange nickname "Boss". Once Nikita decided to go with his friend Alex to the Summer Biathlon World Cup. Nikita, as a very important person, received a token which allows to place bets on each section no more than on one competitor.

To begin with friends learned the rules: in the race there are n sections of equal length and m participants. The participants numbered from 1 to m. About each participant the following is known:

  * li — the number of the starting section, 
  * ri — the number of the finishing section (li ≤ ri),
  * ti — the time a biathlete needs to complete an section of the path,
  * ci — the profit in roubles. If the i-th sportsman wins on one of the sections, the profit will be given to the man who had placed a bet on that sportsman.



The i-th biathlete passes the sections from li to ri inclusive. The competitor runs the whole way in (ri - li + 1)·ti time units. It takes him exactly ti time units to pass each section. In case of the athlete's victory on k sections the man who has betted on him receives k·ci roubles.

In each section the winner is determined independently as follows: if there is at least one biathlete running this in this section, then among all of them the winner is the one who has ran this section in minimum time (spent minimum time passing this section). In case of equality of times the athlete with the smaller index number wins. If there are no participants in this section, then the winner in this section in not determined. We have to say that in the summer biathlon all the participants are moving at a constant speed.

We should also add that Nikita can bet on each section and on any contestant running in this section.

Help the friends find the maximum possible profit.

Input

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100). Then follow m lines, each containing 4 integers li, ri, ti, ci (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ n, 1 ≤ ti, ci ≤ 1000).

Output

Print a single integer, the maximal profit in roubles that the friends can get. In each of n sections it is not allowed to place bets on more than one sportsman.

Note

In the first test the optimal bet is: in the 1-2 sections on biathlete 1, in section 3 on biathlete 3, in section 4 on biathlete 4. Total: profit of 5 rubles for 1 section, the profit of 5 rubles for 2 section, profit of 30 rubles for a 3 section, profit of 20 rubles for 4 section. Total profit 60 rubles.

In the second test the optimal bet is: on 1 and 5 sections on biathlete 1, in the 2-4 sections on biathlete 2, in the 6-7 sections on athlete 4. There is no winner in the 8 section. Total: profit of 10 rubles for 1 section, the profit of 15 rubles for 2,3,4 section, profit of 10 rubles for a 5 section, profit of 20 rubles for 6, 7 section. Total profit 105 rubles.

assistant: ### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

Based on the provided hit counts for both the slow and fast inputs, we can make several observations:

1. **Loop over Input**:
   - The loop on line 13 (`for (int i = 0; i < m; i++)`) is hit significantly more often in the slow input (31 times compared to 5 times in the fast input). This indicates that the number of participants (`m`) directly influences execution time. This is expected because the loop iterates over each participant to process their details.

2. **Event Processing Loop**:
   - The loop on line 21 (`for (multimap<pair<int, int>, int>::iterator i = s.begin(); i != s.end(); i++)`) also shows significantly higher hit counts for the slow input (61 times versus 9 times for the fast input). This loop processes each event (start and end of sections for each athlete), and its performance is influenced by the total number of events, which is `2 * m` (since each athlete contributes two events – start and finish).

3. **Conditional Branching**:
   - The conditional branching inside the loop (`if (o == 0)`) is executed 60 times for the slow input and 8 times for the fast input. This shows that most iterations are processing start events.

4. **Set Operations**:
   - Operations on the set `p` (lines 29 and 35) are executed frequently and involve inserting or erasing elements representing athletes. The time complexity of these operations is logarithmic concerning the number of elements in the set, which can be a source of inefficiency if the set grows large.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the analysis above, here are potential performance-characterizing invariants in natural language:

1. **High Number of Participants**:
   - "When the number of participants (`m`) is large, the initialization and processing of start and finish events grows, causing a significant slowdown. This is because each participant contributes two events to the multimap, leading to increased iterations and set operations."

2. **Heavy Use of Data Structures**:
   - "If there are many overlapping sections where athletes compete, the set used to determine winners can grow large, leading to increased overhead in insertion and removal operations. This is particularly evident when multiple athletes are racing in the same sections over extended ranges."

3. **Event Complexity**:
   - "Complexity arises when there are many start and finish events (due to many athletes or extended race lengths), resulting in frequent conditional checks and updates to data structures. This increased complexity can significantly impact performance as the number of events grows."

These invariants focus on structural aspects of the input that affect performance, such as the number of participants and the complexity induced by multiple overlapping sections. As such, they help identify potential slow scenarios without relying on specific input values.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:

We should also add that Nikita can bet on each section and on any contestant running in this section.

Help the friends find the maximum possible profit.

Input

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100). Then follow m lines, each containing 4 integers li, ri, ti, ci (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ n, 1 ≤ ti, ci ≤ 1000).

Output

Print a single integer, the maximal profit in roubles that the friends can get. In each of n sections it is not allowed to place bets on more than one sportsman.

Examples

Input

4 4
1 4 20 5

3 3 4 30
3 4 4 20


Output

60

Input

8 4

2 4 6 15
4 6 30 50
6 7 4 20


Output

105

Note

In the first test the optimal bet is: in the 1-2 sections on biathlete 1, in section 3 on biathlete 3, in section 4 on biathlete 4. Total: profit of 5 rubles for 1 section, the profit of 5 rubles for 2 section, profit of 30 rubles for a 3 section, profit of 20 rubles for 4 section. Total profit 60 rubles.

In the second test the optimal bet is: on 1 and 5 sections on biathlete 1, in the 2-4 sections on biathlete 2, in the 6-7 sections on athlete 4. There is no winner in the 8 section. Total: profit of 10 rubles for 1 section, the profit of 15 rubles for 2,3,4 section, profit of 10 rubles for a 5 section, profit of 20 rubles for 6, 7 section. Total profit 105 rubles.

assistant: ### Phase 3: Implementing Performance-Characterizing Invariants in C++

Based on the natural language invariants derived previously, we will now write C++ code snippets to check these conditions at runtime. Here are the implementations:

1. **High Number of Participants**:
   ```cpp
   // Checker for high number of participants
   void check_participant_invariant(int m) {
       if (m > 80) {  // Arbitrary threshold chosen well below the problem constraint
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - too many participants!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Heavy Use of Data Structures**:
   ```cpp
   // Checker for heavy use of data structures during overlapping sections
   void check_overlap_invariant(int maxConcurrentParticipants) {
       if (maxConcurrentParticipants > 50) {  // Arbitrary threshold to detect overlap pressure
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - heavy overlap in sections!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Event Complexity**:
   ```cpp
   // Checker for high event complexity due to many start and finish events
   void check_event_complexity_invariant(int eventCount) {
       if (eventCount > 180) {  // Assume eventCount = 2 * m, set threshold
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high event complexity!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Integrating Checkers into the Original C++ Program

Let's integrate these checks into the provided C++ code.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

struct A {
    int start, finish;
    int time, coin;
    A() {}
    A(int s, int f, int t, int c) { start = s, finish = f, time = t, coin = c; }
} a[105];

// Checker for high number of participants
void check_participant_invariant(int m) {
    if (m > 80) {  // Arbitrary threshold chosen well below the problem constraint
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - too many participants!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Checker for heavy use of data structures during overlapping sections
void check_overlap_invariant(int maxConcurrentParticipants) {
    if (maxConcurrentParticipants > 50) {  // Arbitrary threshold to detect overlap pressure
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - heavy overlap in sections!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Checker for high event complexity due to many start and finish events
void check_event_complexity_invariant(int eventCount) {
    if (eventCount > 180) {  // Assume eventCount = 2 * m, set threshold
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high event complexity!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    int n, m;
    cin >> n >> m;

    // Check for high number of participants
    check_participant_invariant(m);

    multimap<pair<int, int>, int> s;
    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        cin >> a[i].start >> a[i].finish >> a[i].time >> a[i].coin;
        s.insert(make_pair(make_pair(a[i].start, 0), i));
        s.insert(make_pair(make_pair(a[i].finish, 1), i));
    }

    // Check for high event complexity
    check_event_complexity_invariant(2 * m);

    a[101].coin = 0;
    set<pair<int, int>> p;
    int last = 0, ans = 0;
    int maxConcurrentParticipants = 0;

    for (multimap<pair<int, int>, int>::iterator i = s.begin(); i != s.end(); i++) {
        int t = i->first.first, o = i->first.second, id = i->second;
        if (o == 0) {
            int dif = t - last - 1;
            last = t - 1;
            int winner = (p.size() ? p.begin()->second : 101);
            ans += a[winner].coin * dif;
            p.insert(make_pair(a[id].time, id));
        } else {
            int dif = t - last;
            last = t;
            int winner = (p.size() ? p.begin()->second : 101);
            ans += a[winner].coin * dif;
            p.erase(make_pair(a[id].time, id));
        }

        // Update max concurrent participants during overlap
        maxConcurrentParticipants = max(maxConcurrentParticipants, (int)p.size());
    }

    // Check for heavy overlap in sections
    check_overlap_invariant(maxConcurrentParticipants);

    cout << ans << "\n";
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

- **Participant Invariant**: Checked right after input to ensure `m` isn't too high.
- **Event Complexity Invariant**: Checked post input processing, considering total events `2 * m`.
- **Overlap Invariant**: Checked post main loop, measuring peak concurrent participants.

These checks help detect potential slowdowns early in the execution and provide useful feedback for performance tuning.
