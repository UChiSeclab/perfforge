system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

Orac is studying number theory, and he is interested in the properties of divisors.

For two positive integers a and b, a is a divisor of b if and only if there exists an integer c, such that a⋅ c=b.

For n ≥ 2, we will denote as f(n) the smallest positive divisor of n, except 1.

For example, f(7)=7,f(10)=2,f(35)=5.

For the fixed integer n, Orac decided to add f(n) to n. 

For example, if he had an integer n=5, the new value of n will be equal to 10. And if he had an integer n=6, n will be changed to 8.

Orac loved it so much, so he decided to repeat this operation several times.

Now, for two positive integers n and k, Orac asked you to add f(n) to n exactly k times (note that n will change after each operation, so f(n) may change too) and tell him the final value of n.

For example, if Orac gives you n=5 and k=2, at first you should add f(5)=5 to n=5, so your new value of n will be equal to n=10, after that, you should add f(10)=2 to 10, so your new (and the final!) value of n will be equal to 12.

Orac may ask you these queries many times.

Input

The first line of the input is a single integer t\ (1≤ t≤ 100): the number of times that Orac will ask you.

Each of the next t lines contains two positive integers n,k\ (2≤ n≤ 10^6, 1≤ k≤ 10^9), corresponding to a query by Orac.

It is guaranteed that the total sum of n is at most 10^6. 

Output

Print t lines, the i-th of them should contain the final value of n in the i-th query by Orac.

Example

Input


3
5 1
8 2
3 4


Output


10
12
12

Note

In the first query, n=5 and k=1. The divisors of 5 are 1 and 5, the smallest one except 1 is 5. Therefore, the only operation adds f(5)=5 to 5, and the result is 10.

In the second query, n=8 and k=2. The divisors of 8 are 1,2,4,8, where the smallest one except 1 is 2, then after one operation 8 turns into 8+(f(8)=2)=10. The divisors of 10 are 1,2,5,10, where the smallest one except 1 is 2, therefore the answer is 10+(f(10)=2)=12.

In the third query, n is changed as follows: 3 → 6 → 8 → 10 → 12.

(F) Program Solving the Problem Statement

using namespace std;
int main() {
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0), cin.tie(0), cout.tie(0);
  int t;
  cin >> t;

    cin >> n >> k;
    if (n % 2 == 0) {
      cout << n + 2 * k << endl;
      continue;
    }
    int p = 0;
    for (int i = n; i >= 2; i--) {
      if (n % i == 0) {
        p = i;
      }
    }
    cout << n + p + 2 * (k - 1) << endl;

assistant: ### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Line-Level Hit Count Analysis:**
   - The line `for (int i = n; i >= 2; i--)` (line 15) was executed 999,961 times in the slow input, but not at all in the fast input.
   - The condition `if (n % i == 0)` (line 16) was checked 999,960 times in the slow input, indicating that this loop is the primary source of the slowdown.
   - The fast input triggered the condition `if (n % 2 == 0)` (line 10), executing the direct computation path `cout << n + 2 * k << endl;` (line 11) immediately, skipping the divisor search loop entirely.

2. **Inefficient Segment Identification:**
   - The inefficient segment is the loop from `n` down to 2, searching for divisors of `n` (lines 15-17). This loop runs in O(n) time complexity, which is expensive for large values of `n`.

3. **Interaction with Data Structures and Problem Constraints:**
   - The slowdown occurs when `n` is an odd number and requires finding its smallest divisor greater than 1. When `n` is a large prime number, this loop will iterate nearly the entire range from `n` to 2 until it hits the smallest divisor, which is `n` itself for primes.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **Invariant: Odd and Large Prime `n`:**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "The program slows down significantly when `n` is a large odd prime number because it requires a complete search from `n` down to 2 to identify the smallest divisor, which is `n` itself."
   - **Condition Abstracted:** This slowdown is exacerbated when `n` is close to or at the upper limit of the problem constraints (e.g., `n` is a large prime near 10^6).

2. **Invariant: Non-prime Odd `n`:**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "If `n` is a large odd number with few divisors, the program may still slow down due to the extensive divisor search required, impacting performance."
   - **Condition Abstracted:** The inefficiency is triggered even if `n` is not prime but has very few divisors, causing nearly O(n) iterations.

3. **Invariant: Large `k` with Odd Prime `n`:**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "With a large `k`, if the initial `n` is a large odd prime, performance degrades as the divisor search loop is triggered initially, but subsequent operations become trivial."
   - **Condition Abstracted:** Initial conditions that force the expensive divisor search are problematic, especially when `k` is large, making the initial cycle the bottleneck.

The identified invariants allow us to understand the slow path: it's primarily triggered by the characteristics of `n` (being a large odd prime or having few divisors) that direct the program into the expensive divisor search loop. The solution path is efficient but only when `n` is even, allowing immediate computation.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
Orac is studying number theory, and he is interested in the properties of divisors.

For two positive integers a and b, a is a divisor of b if and only if there exists an integer c, such that a⋅ c=b.

For n ≥ 2, we will denote as f(n) the smallest positive divisor of n, except 1.

For example, f(7)=7,f(10)=2,f(35)=5.

For the fixed integer n, Orac decided to add f(n) to n. 

For example, if he had an integer n=5, the new value of n will be equal to 10. And if he had an integer n=6, n will be changed to 8.

Orac loved it so much, so he decided to repeat this operation several times.

Now, for two positive integers n and k, Orac asked you to add f(n) to n exactly k times (note that n will change after each operation, so f(n) may change too) and tell him the final value of n.

For example, if Orac gives you n=5 and k=2, at first you should add f(5)=5 to n=5, so your new value of n will be equal to n=10, after that, you should add f(10)=2 to 10, so your new (and the final!) value of n will be equal to 12.

Orac may ask you these queries many times.

Input

The first line of the input is a single integer t\ (1≤ t≤ 100): the number of times that Orac will ask you.

Each of the next t lines contains two positive integers n,k\ (2≤ n≤ 10^6, 1≤ k≤ 10^9), corresponding to a query by Orac.

It is guaranteed that the total sum of n is at most 10^6. 

Output

Print t lines, the i-th of them should contain the final value of n in the i-th query by Orac.

Example

Input


3
5 1
8 2
3 4


Output


10
12
12

Note

In the first query, n=5 and k=1. The divisors of 5 are 1 and 5, the smallest one except 1 is 5. Therefore, the only operation adds f(5)=5 to 5, and the result is 10.

In the second query, n=8 and k=2. The divisors of 8 are 1,2,4,8, where the smallest one except 1 is 2, then after one operation 8 turns into 8+(f(8)=2)=10. The divisors of 10 are 1,2,5,10, where the smallest one except 1 is 2, therefore the answer is 10+(f(10)=2)=12.

In the third query, n is changed as follows: 3 → 6 → 8 → 10 → 12.

Solution (C++ code):
{solution}


assistant: ### Phase 3: Implement the Natural Language Invariants in C++

To implement the performance-characterizing invariants identified earlier, we'll create checker functions in C++. These functions will validate conditions leading to performance bottlenecks, such as when `n` is a large odd prime or when `n` is an odd number with few divisors.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;

// Function to check if a number is prime
bool isPrime(int number) {
    if (number <= 1) return false;
    if (number <= 3) return true;
    if (number % 2 == 0 || number % 3 == 0) return false;
    for (int i = 5; i * i <= number; i += 6) {
        if (number % i == 0 || number % (i + 2) == 0)
            return false;
    }
    return true;
}

// Checker function for large odd prime n
void check_large_odd_prime_invariant(int n) {
    if (n % 2 != 0 && isPrime(n)) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large odd prime!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Checker function for odd n with few divisors
void check_odd_few_divisors_invariant(int n) {
    if (n % 2 != 0) {
        int divisor_count = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= sqrt(n); ++i) {
            if (n % i == 0) {
                if (i * i == n) 
                    divisor_count++;
                else
                    divisor_count += 2;
            }
        }
        if (divisor_count <= 3) { // Few divisors other than 1 and n itself
            cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - odd number with few divisors!" << endl;
            abort();
        }
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrate Checker Code with the Original Program

Now, we'll integrate these checker functions into the original C++ program. The checks will be inserted at points where `n` is read, which is a logical place to intercept potential bottlenecks without introducing unnecessary overhead.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

bool isPrime(int number) {
    if (number <= 1) return false;
    if (number <= 3) return true;
    if (number % 2 == 0 || number % 3 == 0) return false;
    for (int i = 5; i * i <= number; i += 6) {
        if (number % i == 0 || number % (i + 2) == 0)
            return false;
    }
    return true;
}

void check_large_odd_prime_invariant(int n) {
    if (n % 2 != 0 && isPrime(n)) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large odd prime!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_odd_few_divisors_invariant(int n) {
    if (n % 2 != 0) {
        int divisor_count = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= sqrt(n); ++i) {
            if (n % i == 0) {
                if (i * i == n) 
                    divisor_count++;
                else

### Explanation of Bottleneck Detection

- **Large Odd Prime `n`:** The function `check_large_odd_prime_invariant` checks if `n` is a large odd prime when it is read from the input. This invariant captures the worst-case scenario where `n` requires a full divisor search.
  
- **Odd `n` with Few Divisors:** The function `check_odd_few_divisors_invariant` checks if `n` is an odd number with few divisors. If `n` has very few divisors, the divisor search loop remains inefficient.

These checks help in identifying when the program might encounter a performance bottleneck due to the input `n`'s characteristics and can aid debugging and performance tuning.
