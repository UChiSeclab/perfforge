## Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

### Analysis of Hit Counts

- **Line 67-68**: This block is executed only when `n` is even. In the fast input, this path is taken, indicating that for even `n`, the computation is straightforward and efficient.
- **Line 71-74**: This loop is the primary source of slow performance for the slow input. It iterates from `2` to `n`, finding the smallest positive divisor of `n` greater than `1`. The slow input `n = 149197` is odd and has a high hit count on this loop, indicating that finding the smallest divisor takes many iterations, likely because `n` is a large prime.
  
### Interaction with Data Structures and Input Constraints

- Since `n` is at most `10^6`, the loop for finding the smallest divisor can potentially iterate up to `n` times in the worst-case scenario, particularly problematic for large prime numbers.
- The `slow` input is indicative of a scenario where `n` is a large prime, requiring maximum iterations to find the divisor, whereas the `fast` input likely benefits from `n` being even, directly utilizing the efficient path.

## Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

### Natural Language Performance Invariants

1. **Large Prime Number Trap**:
   - Natural Language: "When `n` is a large prime number, the loop for finding the smallest divisor becomes expensive, iterating nearly up to `n`. This leads to significant slowdowns due to the vast number of iterations."
   - This scenario is particularly problematic because it doesn't benefit from any early exits in the loop and requires checking each possible divisor up to `n`.

2. **Even Numbers Efficiency**:
   - Natural Language: "If `n` is even, the program efficiently computes the result in constant time, as the smallest divisor is always `2`, allowing direct computation of the final result."

3. **Near Prime Composite Numbers**:
   - Natural Language: "Numbers that are not prime but have their smallest divisor close to `n` also lead to significant work in the loop, similar to prime numbers, as they require many iterations to resolve the divisor."

By focusing on these patterns, performance can be better predicted and managed. For example, incorporating an efficient primality test or immediately checking for divisibility by small primes could mitigate the performance cost for large prime `n`.

### Phase 3: Implement the Natural Language Invariants as Runtime Checks in C++

Based on the performance-characterizing invariants derived earlier, here are the C++ snippets to check these conditions at runtime:

1. **Large Prime Number Trap**:
   ```cpp
   void check_large_prime_invariant(bool condition) {
       if (condition) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck triggered - large prime number detected!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Even Numbers Efficiency**:
   - This invariant doesn't require a runtime check, as it describes an efficient path in the code.

3. **Near Prime Composite Numbers**:
   ```cpp
   void check_near_prime_invariant(bool condition) {
       if (condition) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck triggered - near prime composite number detected!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Integrate the Checker Code with the Original Program

Below is the original C++ code instrumented with the above runtime checks to detect slow performance scenarios:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

const int inf = 2000000000;
const long long infLL = 9000000000000000000;

// Checkers for performance bottlenecks
void check_large_prime_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck triggered - large prime number detected!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_near_prime_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck triggered - near prime composite number detected!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
    cin.tie(0);
    cout.tie(0);

    int t;
    cin >> t;
    while (t--) {
        long long n, k;
        cin >> n >> k;

        // Checking for large prime or near-prime composite numbers
        bool isLargePrimeOrNearPrime = true;
        for (int i = 2; i <= sqrt(n); ++i) {
            if (n % i == 0) {
                isLargePrimeOrNearPrime = false;
                break;
            }
        }
        check_large_prime_invariant(isLargePrimeOrNearPrime && n > 100000);
        check_near_prime_invariant(isLargePrimeOrNearPrime && n <= 100000);

        if (n % 2 == 0) {
            cout << n + 2 * k << '\n';
            continue;
        }
        long long hmm;
        for (int i = 2; i <= n; ++i) {
            if (n % i == 0) {
                hmm = i;
                break;
            }
        }
        n += hmm;
        long long ans = n + (k - 1) * 2;
        cout << ans << '\n';
    }
}
```

### Explanation of Inserts

- **Large Prime Check**: After reading `n`, we check whether `n` is a large prime by attempting to divide it by all integers up to its square root. If no divisors are found and `n` is significantly large (greater than 100,000), it is flagged as a potential performance bottleneck.

- **Near Prime Composite Check**: Similarly, this check is used to identify numbers that may act like primes (i.e., numbers with few divisors close to `n`).

These checks help to detect inputs that could cause the program to run slowly, thereby providing early warnings about potential performance issues.
