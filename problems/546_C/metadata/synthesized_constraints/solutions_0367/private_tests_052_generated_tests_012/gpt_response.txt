### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

#### Analysis of Hit Counts

The key observation from the hit count data is the drastic increase in the number of iterations of the `while` loop (lines 20-34) for the slow input compared to the fast input:

- The `while` loop is executed `10,000,000` times for the slow input.
- For the fast input, the loop runs only once.

This suggests that the slow input causes the game simulation to reach the artificial limit of `10,000,000` iterations, as indicated by the condition `if (cnt == 10000000) break;`.

#### Potential Causes of High Iterations

1. **Cycle Detection**: The loop might be running into a cycling pattern where the same configuration of card stacks repeats indefinitely without a resolution. Since the problem's constraints (e.g., n â‰¤ 10) are small, such a cycle can occur, leading to a non-terminating game.

2. **Data Structure Updates**: The operations within the loop involve popping and pushing elements to/from deques (`p1` and `p2`). These operations themselves are efficient for deques, but the issue lies more in the game logic causing prolonged execution.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the analysis, the following natural language invariants describe scenarios that can lead to a slowdown in the program:

1. **Cycle Formation**:
   - "If the game enters a repeating cycle where the cards are redistributed without a reduction in stack size, the program may simulate indefinitely, reaching the iteration cap of 10,000,000 without a winner."

2. **Balanced Initial Distribution**:
   - "When the initial card distribution between players is such that neither player consistently outplays the other, it can lead to prolonged back-and-forth exchanges, increasing the likelihood of hitting a repeating cycle."

3. **Equal Power Stacks**:
   - "When both players have stacks composed of closely matched card values, especially with the strongest cards distributed evenly, the game may result in a repetitive sequence of fights without progressing towards a win condition."

These conditions address the scenario where the loop reaches a high iteration count due to repetitive game states, rather than converging to a solution or breaking due to one player running out of cards. These invariants help identify when the game logic could cause long execution times, even within the small input constraints of the problem.

### Phase 3: Implement the Natural Language Invariants in C++

Based on the previously derived natural language invariants, here are the checkers to be implemented in C++:

#### Invariant 1: Cycle Formation
```cpp
void check_cycle_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: cycle_invariant triggered - potential repeating cycle detected!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

#### Invariant 2: Balanced Initial Distribution
```cpp
void check_balanced_distribution(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: balanced_distribution triggered - potentially balanced stacks detected!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

#### Invariant 3: Equal Power Stacks
```cpp
void check_equal_power_stacks(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: equal_power_stacks triggered - closely matched card values detected!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrate Checker Code into the Original Program

Here is the instrumented C++ code with the integrated checkers:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
const int oo = 1e9 + 7;
int n, k1, k2, cnt = 0;
deque<int> p1, p2;

// Checker for potential repeating cycle
void check_cycle_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: cycle_invariant triggered - potential repeating cycle detected!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Checker for balanced initial distribution
void check_balanced_distribution(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: balanced_distribution triggered - potentially balanced stacks detected!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Checker for equal power stacks
void check_equal_power_stacks(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: equal_power_stacks triggered - closely matched card values detected!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    scanf("%d", &n);
    scanf("%d", &k1);
    for (int i = 1; i <= k1; ++i) {
        int u;
        scanf("%d", &u);
        p1.push_back(u);
    }
    scanf("%d", &k2);
    for (int i = 1; i <= k2; ++i) {
        int u;
        scanf("%d", &u);
        p2.push_back(u);
    }

    // Check for balanced initial distribution
    check_balanced_distribution(abs((int)p1.size() - (int)p2.size()) <= 1);

    // Check for equal power stacks at the start
    vector<int> sorted_p1(p1.begin(), p1.end());
    vector<int> sorted_p2(p2.begin(), p2.end());
    sort(sorted_p1.begin(), sorted_p1.end());
    sort(sorted_p2.begin(), sorted_p2.end());
    bool equal_power_detected = (sorted_p1 == sorted_p2);
    check_equal_power_stacks(equal_power_detected);

    // Simulate the game and detect cycles
    set<pair<deque<int>, deque<int>>> seen_states;
    while (p1.size() != 0 && p2.size() != 0) {
        // Check for a repeating cycle
        check_cycle_invariant(seen_states.count({p1, p2}) > 0);
        seen_states.insert({p1, p2});

        int c1 = p1.front(); p1.pop_front();
        int c2 = p2.front(); p2.pop_front();
        
        if (c1 <= c2) {
            p2.push_back(c1);
            p2.push_back(c2);
        } else {
            p1.push_back(c2);
            p1.push_back(c1);
        }
        cnt++;
        if (cnt == 10000000) break;
        if (p1.size() == 0 || p2.size() == 0) break;
    }
    
    if (p1.size() == 0)
        cout << cnt << " " << "2";
    else if (p2.size() == 0)
        cout << cnt << " " << "1";
    else if (cnt == 10000000)
        cout << "-1";
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Cycle Formation**: The `seen_states` set stores each unique state of the game (stacks of both players) and checks if a state repeats, indicating a potential cycle.

2. **Balanced Initial Distribution**: Before the main loop, the initial card distribution is checked to see if the decks are closely balanced in size.

3. **Equal Power Stacks**: The initial stacks are sorted and compared to detect if both have similar strength (same sorted cards).

These checks are placed efficiently to detect potential bottlenecks without adding significant overhead to the main loop.
