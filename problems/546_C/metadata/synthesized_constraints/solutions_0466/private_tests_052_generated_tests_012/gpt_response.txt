### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Comparison of Hit Counts**: 
   - The lines within the main game loop (lines 32-48) show a dramatic difference in hit counts between the slow and fast inputs. 
   - Specifically, line 32 (`while` loop) is hit 40,000,002 times for the slow input compared to just 2 times for the fast input. 
   - The condition checks and subsequent actions in lines 33-48 are also executed 40,000,001 times for the slow input, demonstrating that the loop is being repeated excessively.

2. **Pinpoint Specific Lines**: 
   - The main loop on line 32 and its body (lines 33-48) are responsible for the slowdown. This loop is intended to simulate the game rounds and should theoretically end when one player's deck is empty.
   - The condition at line 35 triggers when the loop reaches a certain hit count (4e7), indicating a potential infinite game loop.

3. **Inference on Code Behavior**:
   - The game logic leads to an excessive number of iterations on the slow input, which suggests that the conditions for a player to lose aren't being met quickly enough, potentially leading to a stalemate or infinitely repeating state.
   - The data structure interaction involves repeatedly transferring cards between the two queues (`q1` and `q2`), leading to an excessive number of operations due to a repetitive pattern in card values.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **Natural Language Statements**:
   - **Invariant 1**: "If the sequence of card values causes the game to reach a repetitive state where the same card configurations recur repeatedly, the game may take a very long time to conclude, or may not conclude at all."
   - **Invariant 2**: "When both players have card values that lead to a cyclic or non-converging sequence of hands, the game can enter a slow path, potentially iterating indefinitely."
   - **Invariant 3**: "If neither player can gain a definitive advantage due to the value distribution of cards, leading to constant switching of cards without reducing the size of one player's stack, the performance may degrade into an infinite loop."

2. **Thresholds and Conditions**:
   - These invariants do not rely on specific numeric values but instead focus on the structural pattern of the game—specifically, when the game dynamics create a loop or stalemate. Given the problem constraints of n ≤ 10, this behavior is realistic and can be anticipated.

3. **Future Scenarios**:
   - By focusing on the behavior of the card values and how they influence the game state, these invariants are broad enough to capture future inputs that might trigger similar slowdowns. For example, any distribution of cards leading to a continuing cycle without progress toward a player winning will likely trigger this slow path. 

These performance-characterizing invariants should guide enhancements or checks within the code to detect and mitigate these slow scenarios effectively, potentially by identifying repeating game states and breaking out of these cycles early.

### Phase 3: Implementing the Natural Language Invariants in C++

For the given natural language invariants, I will implement checker functions that catch potential infinite loops or excessively long game sequences based on the described conditions.

#### Invariant 1: Repetitive State Leading to Long Execution
```cpp
void check_repetitive_state_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: repetitive_state_invariant triggered - game may enter a repetitive state with no progress!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

This checker can be invoked if the game reaches a certain large number of iterations without ending. Since our problem constraint is small (n ≤ 10), we can set a threshold based on theoretical maximum combinations, such as a few thousand.

#### Invariant 2: Cyclic or Non-Converging Sequence
```cpp
void check_cyclic_sequence_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: cyclic_sequence_invariant triggered - potential cyclic sequence detected!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

This can be implemented by maintaining a history of seen states and checking for repetitive cycles.

### Phase 4: Integrating Checker Code into the Original Program

Below is the instrumented version of the original C++ code, incorporating the checker functions at suitable places:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Checker for repetitive state invariant
void check_repetitive_state_invariant(long long ans) {
    if (ans > 1000) {  // Arbitrary threshold for demonstration
        cerr << "Warning: repetitive_state_invariant triggered - game may enter a repetitive state with no progress!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Checker for cyclic sequence invariant
void check_cyclic_sequence_invariant(set<pair<queue<long long int>, queue<long long int>>> &previousStates, queue<long long int> &q1, queue<long long int> &q2) {
    if (previousStates.find({q1, q2}) != previousStates.end()) {
        cerr << "Warning: cyclic_sequence_invariant triggered - potential cyclic sequence detected!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);
    cout.tie(NULL);

    cin >> n;
    long long int k1, k2;
    cin >> k1;
    queue<long long int> q1;
    for (__typeof(k1) i = 0; i != k1; ++i) {
        long long int a;
        cin >> a;
        q1.push(a);
    }
    cin >> k2;
    queue<long long int> q2;
    for (__typeof(k2) i = 0; i != k2; ++i) {
        long long int a;
        cin >> a;
        q2.push(a);
    }

    long long int ans = 0;
    set<pair<queue<long long int>, queue<long long int>>> previousStates;

    while (!q1.empty() && !q2.empty()) {
        check_repetitive_state_invariant(ans); // Checking for excessive iterations

        // Record the current state and check for cycles
        check_cyclic_sequence_invariant(previousStates, q1, q2);
        previousStates.insert({q1, q2});

        long long int a = q1.front();
        long long int b = q2.front();
        if (ans > 4e7) {
            cout << -1;
            return 0;
        }
        if (a < b) {
            q2.push(a);
            q2.push(b);
        } else {
            q1.push(b);
            q1.push(a);
        }
        q1.pop();
        q2.pop();
        ans++;
    }

    cout << ans << " ";
    if (q1.empty())
        cout << 2;
    else
        cout << 1;
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation
1. **Repetitive State Checker**: This was added to the main loop to monitor for excessive iterations, suggesting slow game progress. The threshold of 1000 is arbitrary and should be adjusted based on further analysis.

2. **Cyclic Sequence Checker**: This uses a set to store past states of the queues. If a current state has been seen before, a cycle is detected, and the program aborts.

These checkers are strategically placed outside of tight loops and heavy operations, thus minimizing performance impact while effectively detecting bottleneck conditions.
