### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

**Comparison of Line-Level Hit Counts:**
1. **Line 11: `while (TLE < 10000000)`**  
   - Slow Input Hit Count: 10,000,001  
   - Fast Input Hit Count: 2  
   - The loop iterates a huge number of times in the slow case, indicating the primary performance bottleneck.

2. **Line 16: `TLE++`**  
   - Slow Input Hit Count: 10,000,000  
   - Fast Input Hit Count: 1  
   - TLE increments with each loop iteration, highlighting the sheer number of cycles when the input is slow.

3. **Line 17, 18: Card Drawing and Removing**  
   - Slow Input Hit Count: 10,000,000  
   - Fast Input Hit Count: 1  
   - These operations occur for each iteration of the loop, showing that the game continues for many rounds without ending.

4. **Line 19-22: Conditional Logic for Card Comparison**  
   - Operations are balanced between the two players, resulting in frequent pushes to queues that likely prevent the game from terminating quickly.

**Inference:**
- The loop at **Line 11** running for 10,000,000 iterations is the main cause of slowdown. It suggests a case where neither player wins, and the game enters an infinite-like loop due to constant reshuffling, possibly related to specific initial card orderings.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **Natural Language Invariant #1:**
   - **Condition:** If both players have cards that are close in rank, and the game mechanics cause cards to cycle without clear dominance by one player, the game may enter into an extended or infinite state.
   - **Explanation:** The slow case indicates that when card values are such that neither player gains a lasting advantage (e.g., similar card strengths or cyclic patterns), the game continues indefinitely without resolution.
   
2. **Natural Language Invariant #2:**
   - **Condition:** When the distribution of cards allows for frequent ties or back-and-forth exchanges with minimal changes to players' card stacks, the process may continue for a long time.
   - **Explanation:** The balanced nature of exchanges, where the winning card is not sufficiently stronger to deplete the opponent's deck quickly, results in prolonged gameplay.

3. **Natural Language Invariant #3:**
   - **Condition:** If the initial distribution of cards is such that neither stack ever becomes significantly larger than the other, the loop of the game can continue without reaching a terminating condition.
   - **Explanation:** Balanced card distribution or specific initial arrangements that prevent dominance by either player can lead to the observed slow performance.

These statements encapsulate the conditions under which the game's mechanics lead to protracted execution times, focusing on the cyclic or balanced nature of card exchanges rather than specific numerical setups.

### Phase 3: Implement the Natural Language Invariants in C++

Below are the checker functions that implement the performance-characterizing invariants derived earlier.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
#include <unordered_set>
using namespace std;

// Check if the queue configurations have repeated, indicating a cycle
void check_cycle_invariant(const queue<int>& r1, const queue<int>& r2, unordered_set<string>& seenConfigurations) {
    string config;
    auto copy1 = r1, copy2 = r2;
    while (!copy1.empty()) {
        config += to_string(copy1.front()) + ",";
        copy1.pop();
    }
    config += "|";
    while (!copy2.empty()) {
        config += to_string(copy2.front()) + ",";
        copy2.pop();
    }
    
    if (seenConfigurations.find(config) != seenConfigurations.end()) {
        cerr << "Warning: Cycle detected - potential infinite loop!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
    seenConfigurations.insert(config);
}

// Check if neither player can win quickly due to balanced card strength
void check_balance_invariant(const queue<int>& r1, const queue<int>& r2) {
    int max1 = *max_element(r1.front(), r1.back());
    int max2 = *max_element(r2.front(), r2.back());
    if (abs(max1 - max2) <= 1) { // Arbitrarily chosen threshold for similar max strength
        cerr << "Warning: Balanced card strength - prolonged game possible!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Check for excessive number of rounds
void check_excessive_rounds(int TLE) {
    if (TLE > 1000) { // Example threshold, can be adjusted for practical purposes
        cerr << "Warning: Excessive number of game rounds!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrate Checks into the Original Program

Below is the original C++ code with integrated checks for performance bottlenecks, which will abort and display warnings when a potential bottleneck condition is met.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Function declarations for invariant checks
void check_cycle_invariant(const queue<int>& r1, const queue<int>& r2, unordered_set<string>& seenConfigurations);
void check_balance_invariant(const queue<int>& r1, const queue<int>& r2);
void check_excessive_rounds(int TLE);

queue<int> r1, r2;
int n, x, TLE, asd;
bool flag;

int main() {
    cin >> n >> x;
    for (int i = 1; i <= x; i++) cin >> asd, r1.push(asd);
    cin >> x;
    for (int i = 1; i <= x; i++) cin >> asd, r2.push(asd);
    
    unordered_set<string> seenConfigurations; // Set to track seen configurations

    // Check for potential bottlenecks before starting the loop
    check_balance_invariant(r1, r2);
    
    while (TLE < 10000000) {
        check_excessive_rounds(TLE);
        check_cycle_invariant(r1, r2, seenConfigurations);

        if (r1.size() == 0 || r2.size() == 0) {
            flag = 1;
            break;
        }
        TLE++;
        int u = r1.front(), v = r2.front();
        r1.pop(), r2.pop();
        if (u > v)
            r1.push(v), r1.push(u);
        else
            r2.push(u), r2.push(v);
    }
    
    if (flag)
        if (r1.size() == 0)
            cout << TLE << " " << 2 << endl;
        else
            cout << TLE << " " << 1 << endl;
    else
        puts("-1");
    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation of Check Integration:**
- **Cycle Check:** Implemented using a `unordered_set` to track configurations and detect repeats, indicating a cycle.
- **Balance Check:** Triggered if both players have similar maximum card strengths, suggesting prolonged gameplay.
- **Excessive Rounds Check:** Aborts if rounds exceed a practical threshold to indicate indefinite play.
