### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

Upon examining the hit counts for the fast and slow inputs, the following observations can be made:

1. **Line 14 (`for` loop):** This line has a significantly higher hit count during the slow run (63,246 hits) compared to the fast run (1 hit). This indicates that the for-loop is being executed many times in the slow input scenario.

2. **Line 15 (`if` condition):** This line is also hit 63,246 times during the slow run, which is consistent with the loop iteration count. 

3. **Line 21 (`k` reduction):** This line is hit 63,245 times during the slow run, indicating repeated execution and decrement of `k` within the loop.

The key focus is on the loop starting at line 14, which involves decrementing `k` repeatedly. This indicates that a significant portion of the execution time is spent iterating and modifying `k` until it satisfies the condition in line 15.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the analysis, the following natural language performance invariants can be derived:

1. **Invariant on Loop Iteration Due to Large `k`:** 
   - **Description:** "When `k` is large relative to the sequence of decrement operations determined by the `(n - i - 1)` decrements, the loop will iterate excessively before finding the position for the 'b' characters."
   - **Threshold Suggestion:** A practical threshold for considering `k` large is when `k` approaches the higher end of possible values `(n ⋅ (n-1))/2`, indicating that many iterations will be needed to decrement `k` to a value that satisfies the `if` condition.
   
2. **Invariant on Sequence Construction:**
   - **Description:** "If the constructed string requires the 'b' characters to be placed towards the end of the string, the program will perform many iterations as it searches for suitable positions, especially when `n` is large."
   - **Threshold Suggestion:** This invariant is triggered when the position of the first 'b' is close to `n - 2`, which happens when `k` is large enough, such that it results in many decrements before the condition in line 15 becomes true.

3. **Invariant on Decrement Operations:**
   - **Description:** "The decrement operations on `k` become costly when `k` starts as a large value, leading to a lengthy adjustment period where the loop iterates to reduce `k` until it is small enough to satisfy the condition."
   - **Threshold Suggestion:** A significant threshold is when `k` initially is greater than half of `(n ⋅ (n-1))/2`, indicating it is in the upper range of values and will therefore require extensive decrementing to reach a state where the condition is satisfied.

These invariants provide insight into when the program is likely to slow down due to excessive loop iterations and `k` adjustment, especially for large values of `k` in combination with large `n`.

### Phase 3: Implementing Performance-Characterizing Invariants as C++ Checker Code

Here are the C++ snippets implementing each of the performance-characterizing invariants derived previously:

1. **Invariant on Loop Iteration Due to Large `k`:**

```cpp
void check_large_k_invariant(ll n, ll k) {
    if (k > (n * (n - 1)) / 4) { // Check if k is relatively large
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large k potentially causing excessive loop iterations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

2. **Invariant on Sequence Construction:**

```cpp
void check_sequence_construction_invariant(ll n, ll k) {
    if (k > (n * (n - 1)) / 4) { // Check if k results in positioning 'b's near the string end
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - sequence construction requires many iterations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

3. **Invariant on Decrement Operations:**

```cpp
void check_decrement_operations_invariant(ll n, ll k) {
    if (k > (n * (n - 1)) / 4) { // Ensure k is large enough to necessitate many decrements
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive k decrement operations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrate Checker Code into the Original Program

Here is the final, instrumented version of the original C++ program, incorporating the performance checks:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
using ll = int64_t;
using ull = unsigned long long int;

// Performance checkers
void check_large_k_invariant(ll n, ll k) {
    if (k > (n * (n - 1)) / 4) { // Check if k is relatively large
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large k potentially causing excessive loop iterations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_sequence_construction_invariant(ll n, ll k) {
    if (k > (n * (n - 1)) / 4) { // Check if k results in positioning 'b's near the string end
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - sequence construction requires many iterations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_decrement_operations_invariant(ll n, ll k) {
    if (k > (n * (n - 1)) / 4) { // Ensure k is large enough to necessitate many decrements
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive k decrement operations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);
    int t;
    cin >> t;
    while (t--) {
        ll n, k;
        cin >> n >> k;

        // Insert performance checks
        check_large_k_invariant(n, k);
        check_sequence_construction_invariant(n, k);
        check_decrement_operations_invariant(n, k);

        string s(n, 'a');
        for (ll i = n - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (k <= n - i - 1) {
                s[i] = 'b';
                s[n - k] = 'b';
                cout << s << '\n';
                break;
            }
            k -= n - i - 1;
        }
    }
    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation of Integration:**
- The performance checks are placed immediately after reading the input values `n` and `k`, before entering the main loop. This ensures that these checks are performed without adding overhead inside the loop.
- Each check has an associated warning message and aborts execution if the invariant condition is met, thereby alerting the presence of a potential performance bottleneck.
