### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

Based on the hit count information, the primary difference between the fast and slow runs is observed in the `for` loop on lines 10-16. Here's a breakdown of the operations:

1. **Line 10 (`for` loop):** 
   - Slow input hit count: 63,246
   - Fast input hit count: 1
   - The loop iterates significantly more times on the slow input, indicating that this contributes to the slowdown.

2. **Line 11 (`if` condition check):**
   - Slow input hit count: 63,246
   - Fast input hit count: 1
   - The `if` condition is tested repeatedly, suggesting the logic in this condition is not satisfied early in the loop for the slow input.

3. **Line 16 (`k` update):**
   - Slow input hit count: 63,245
   - Fast input hit count: 0
   - The `k` value is reduced in almost every iteration in the slow input, which means `k` is large enough to bypass the `if` condition on line 11 until many iterations have passed.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

The slowdown is primarily due to the large number of iterations in the loop, driven by the large value of `k` relative to `n`. Here are the performance-characterizing invariants in natural language:

1. **Invariant: Large `k` Relative to `n`**
   - **Natural language description:** "If `k` is a large fraction of `((n * (n - 1)) / 2)`, the loop may iterate excessively, causing significant slowdown."
   - **Explanation:** The loop iterates many times to incrementally reduce `k` until it satisfies the `if` condition. When `k` is large relative to `n`, it takes more iterations to reach the condition.

2. **Invariant: Loop Iteration Depth**
   - **Natural language description:** "When the difference between `k` and the cumulative sum of decrement values (`n - i - 1`) is large, the loop runs many additional iterations, contributing to slower execution."
   - **Explanation:** The loop decrements `k` by `n - i - 1` in each iteration. If `k` is initially much larger than all these decrements combined, the loop runs for many iterations.

3. **Invariant: Early Termination Condition Not Met**
   - **Natural language description:** "When `k` is initially larger than `n * (n-1) / 4`, the early termination condition (`k <= n - i - 1`) is not met early, leading to prolonged loop execution."
   - **Explanation:** The loop condition checks if `k` is less than or equal to `n - i - 1`. When `k` is significantly larger, it takes more iterations before this condition becomes true.

These invariants suggest that performance issues arise when `k` is a large fraction of the maximum permissible value relative to `n`. This leads to many iterations in the loop, slowing down the overall execution.

### Phase 3: Implement the Natural Language Invariants in C++

Let's translate the performance-characterizing invariants into C++ checker code:

1. **Invariant: Large `k` Relative to `n`**

   ```cpp
   void check_large_k_invariant(long long n, long long k) {
       if (k > (n * (n - 1)) / 4) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large k relative to n!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Invariant: Loop Iteration Depth**

   ```cpp
   void check_iteration_depth_invariant(long long n, long long k) {
       long long max_iterations = n * (n - 1) / 2;
       if (k > max_iterations / 2) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive loop iterations!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Invariant: Early Termination Condition Not Met**

   ```cpp
   void check_early_termination_invariant(long long n, long long k) {
       if (k > ((n - 2) * (n + 1)) / 4) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - early termination condition not met!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Integrate the Checker Code with the Original Program

Now we will integrate these checks into the original C++ program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Add checker functions for performance invariants
void check_large_k_invariant(long long n, long long k) {
    if (k > (n * (n - 1)) / 4) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large k relative to n!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_iteration_depth_invariant(long long n, long long k) {
    long long max_iterations = n * (n - 1) / 2;
    if (k > max_iterations / 2) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive loop iterations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_early_termination_invariant(long long n, long long k) {
    if (k > ((n - 2) * (n + 1)) / 4) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - early termination condition not met!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

long long test;
int32_t main() {
    std::cin >> test;
    while (test--) {
        long long n, k;
        std::cin >> n >> k;

        // Insert checks after reading n and k
        check_large_k_invariant(n, k);
        check_iteration_depth_invariant(n, k);
        check_early_termination_invariant(n, k);

        string str(n, 'a');
        for (long long i = n - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (k <= n - i - 1) {
                str[i] = 'b';
                str[n - k] = 'b';
                break;
            } else {
                k -= (n - i - 1);
            }
        }
        std::cout << str << '\n';
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

- **Check Placement:** The invariant checks are placed immediately after reading the input values `n` and `k` and before entering the main computation loop. This ensures that we catch potential performance bottlenecks early without adding overhead within the loop.
- **Abort on Detection:** Each checker outputs a warning message and aborts the program if a bottleneck condition is met, aligning with the requirements to help detect slow paths during testing or fuzzing.
