system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

Vasya will fancy any number as long as it is an integer power of two. Petya, on the other hand, is very conservative and only likes a single integer p (which may be positive, negative, or zero). To combine their tastes, they invented p-binary numbers of the form 2^x + p, where x is a non-negative integer.

For example, some -9-binary ("minus nine" binary) numbers are: -8 (minus eight), 7 and 1015 (-8=2^0-9, 7=2^4-9, 1015=2^{10}-9).

The boys now use p-binary numbers to represent everything. They now face a problem: given a positive integer n, what's the smallest number of p-binary numbers (not necessarily distinct) they need to represent n as their sum? It may be possible that representation is impossible altogether. Help them solve this problem.

For example, if p=0 we can represent 7 as 2^0 + 2^1 + 2^2.

And if p=-9 we can represent 7 as one number (2^4-9).

Note that negative p-binary numbers are allowed to be in the sum (see the Notes section for an example).

Input

The only line contains two integers n and p (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, -1000 ≤ p ≤ 1000).

Output

If it is impossible to represent n as the sum of any number of p-binary numbers, print a single integer -1. Otherwise, print the smallest possible number of summands.

Note

0-binary numbers are just regular binary powers, thus in the first sample case we can represent 24 = (2^4 + 0) + (2^3 + 0).

In the second sample case, we can represent 24 = (2^4 + 1) + (2^2 + 1) + (2^0 + 1).

In the third sample case, we can represent 24 = (2^4 - 1) + (2^2 - 1) + (2^2 - 1) + (2^2 - 1). Note that repeated summands are allowed.

In the fourth sample case, we can represent 4 = (2^4 - 7) + (2^1 - 7). Note that the second summand is negative, which is allowed.

In the fifth sample case, no representation is possible.

int main() { /* line 3 slow_hit_count: 1, fast_hit_count: 1 */

    } /* line 12 slow_hit_count: 0, fast_hit_count: 0 */

      printf("%d\n", i); /* line 14 slow_hit_count: 0, fast_hit_count: 1 */
      return 0; /* line 15 slow_hit_count: 0, fast_hit_count: 1 */
    } /* line 16 slow_hit_count: 0, fast_hit_count: 0 */
  } /* line 17 slow_hit_count: 0, fast_hit_count: 0 */
  printf("-1\n"); /* line 18 slow_hit_count: 1, fast_hit_count: 0 */
} /* line 19 slow_hit_count: 1, fast_hit_count: 0 */


assistant: ### Phase 1: Identifying Expensive Code Segments

Upon analyzing the hit counts, the following observations can be made:

1. **Loop Execution (Line 6):** The loop runs significantly more iterations for the slow input (`1000102` times) compared to the fast input (`2` times). This suggests that the outer loop is a major contributor to the runtime difference.

2. **Binary Digit Counting (Lines 9-11):** The `while` loop inside the main loop is executed `28930321` times for the slow input, indicating a significant amount of work is being done here. This loop counts the number of 1s in the binary representation of `t`, which is derived from `N - P * i`.

3. **Condition (Line 13):** The condition `cnt <= i && i <= N - P * i` is evaluated `1000101` times for the slow input, while it is quickly satisfied for the fast input. This implies that the condition is rarely satisfied for the slow input, causing the loop to iterate to its limit.

### Phase 2: Deriving Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the observations, we can derive the following performance-characterizing invariants:

1. **Invariant Related to Loop Iterations:**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "When the difference between `N` and `P` is small or non-existent, the outer loop can iterate close to its maximum limit, leading to significant slowdowns."
   - **Explanation:** When `P` is close to `N` and `P` is positive, the loop iterates many times because `N - P * i` stays positive for large `i` values. This results in excessive iterations and hence a slowdown.

2. **Invariant Related to Binary Digit Counting:**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "If many iterations are needed to find a suitable representation, the repeated binary counting in the inner loop becomes a major performance bottleneck."
   - **Explanation:** The function of counting binary 1s becomes costly when applied repeatedly across many numbers, which happens when `N - P * i` remains positive for a large number of iterations of `i`.

3. **Invariant Related to Conditional Checks:**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "When the binary representation of `t = N - P * i` tends to have more 1s than the current `i`, the condition checking leads to the loop completing its full range without an early exit."
   - **Explanation:** The condition `cnt <= i` is not satisfied often if `t` is such that its binary form is dense with 1s, causing more iterations and thus slowdown.

By understanding these invariants, one can infer that slowdowns occur primarily due to excessive iterations and repeated inner loop executions, both of which are exacerbated by certain input configurations where `N` and `P` are close in magnitude. These conditions can guide optimization strategies or help identify problematic input cases in a fuzzer.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
Vasya will fancy any number as long as it is an integer power of two. Petya, on the other hand, is very conservative and only likes a single integer p (which may be positive, negative, or zero). To combine their tastes, they invented p-binary numbers of the form 2^x + p, where x is a non-negative integer.

And if p=-9 we can represent 7 as one number (2^4-9).

Note that negative p-binary numbers are allowed to be in the sum (see the Notes section for an example).

Input

The only line contains two integers n and p (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, -1000 ≤ p ≤ 1000).

If it is impossible to represent n as the sum of any number of p-binary numbers, print a single integer -1. Otherwise, print the smallest possible number of summands.

In the fifth sample case, no representation is possible.

Solution (C++ code):
{solution}


assistant: ### Phase 3: Implementing Performance-Characterizing Invariants in C++

Based on the natural language invariants derived earlier, we will create runtime checks in C++ to detect the conditions that lead to performance bottlenecks:

1. **Invariant Related to Loop Iterations:**
   - This invariant checks if the difference between `N` and `P` is small or non-existent, which may cause the loop to iterate many times.
   
   ```cpp
   void check_loop_invariant(int N, int P, int i) {
       if (P > 0 && (N - P * i > 0)) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to excessive loop iterations triggered!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Invariant Related to Binary Digit Counting:**
   - This invariant checks if the inner loop for counting binary ones is called excessively.
   
   ```cpp
   void check_binary_count_invariant(int iterations) {
       if (iterations > 1000000) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to excessive binary counting triggered!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Invariant Related to Conditional Checks:**
   - This invariant checks if the condition `cnt <= i && i <= N - P * i` is rarely satisfied, causing many loop iterations.
   
   ```cpp
   void check_condition_invariant(int cnt, int i, int t) {
       if (cnt > i && i <= t) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to unsatisfied condition triggered!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Integrating Checkers into the Original C++ Code

Now, let's integrate these runtime checks into the original program to detect performance bottlenecks effectively. We will place checks at strategic points to minimize overhead:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Function to check if the loop is taking too many iterations
void check_loop_invariant(int N, int P, int i) {
    if (P > 0 && (N - P * i > 0)) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to excessive loop iterations triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Function to check if binary digit counting is excessive
void check_binary_count_invariant(int iterations) {
    if (iterations > 1000000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to excessive binary counting triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Function to check if condition checks are causing performance issues
void check_condition_invariant(int cnt, int i, int t) {
    if (cnt > i && i <= t) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to unsatisfied condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    int N, P;
    scanf("%d%d", &N, &P);
    for (int i = 0; i <= 1000100; i++) {
        int t = N - P * i;

        // Check loop invariant before intensive computation
        check_loop_invariant(N, P, i);

        int cnt = 0;
        int iterations = 0; // Track iterations within the while loop

        while (t) {
            cnt += t % 2;
            t /= 2;
            iterations++;
        }

        // Check binary count invariant after the while loop
        check_binary_count_invariant(iterations);

        if (cnt <= i && i <= N - P * i) {
            printf("%d\n", i);
            return 0;
        }

        // Check condition invariant after evaluating the condition
        check_condition_invariant(cnt, i, N - P * i);
    }
    printf("-1\n");
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Check Placement:** 
  - **`check_loop_invariant`:** Placed before entering the while loop to avoid unnecessary computation if the main loop iterates excessively.
  - **`check_binary_count_invariant`:** Placed immediately after the while loop to capture cases where the inner loop runs excessively.
  - **`check_condition_invariant`:** Placed after evaluating the condition to monitor cases where the condition is rarely satisfied, causing prolonged iterations.

- **Abort on Condition Trigger:** Each check, when triggered, will output a warning and abort the execution, clearly indicating a potential performance bottleneck. This helps in identifying problematic scenarios early during testing or fuzzing.
