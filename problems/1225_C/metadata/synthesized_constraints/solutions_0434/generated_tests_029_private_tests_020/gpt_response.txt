### Phase 1: Identifying Expensive Code Segments

Upon analyzing the hit counts, the following observations can be made:

1. **Loop Execution (Line 6):** The loop runs significantly more iterations for the slow input (`1000102` times) compared to the fast input (`2` times). This suggests that the outer loop is a major contributor to the runtime difference.

2. **Binary Digit Counting (Lines 9-11):** The `while` loop inside the main loop is executed `28930321` times for the slow input, indicating a significant amount of work is being done here. This loop counts the number of 1s in the binary representation of `t`, which is derived from `N - P * i`.

3. **Condition (Line 13):** The condition `cnt <= i && i <= N - P * i` is evaluated `1000101` times for the slow input, while it is quickly satisfied for the fast input. This implies that the condition is rarely satisfied for the slow input, causing the loop to iterate to its limit.

### Phase 2: Deriving Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the observations, we can derive the following performance-characterizing invariants:

1. **Invariant Related to Loop Iterations:**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "When the difference between `N` and `P` is small or non-existent, the outer loop can iterate close to its maximum limit, leading to significant slowdowns."
   - **Explanation:** When `P` is close to `N` and `P` is positive, the loop iterates many times because `N - P * i` stays positive for large `i` values. This results in excessive iterations and hence a slowdown.

2. **Invariant Related to Binary Digit Counting:**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "If many iterations are needed to find a suitable representation, the repeated binary counting in the inner loop becomes a major performance bottleneck."
   - **Explanation:** The function of counting binary 1s becomes costly when applied repeatedly across many numbers, which happens when `N - P * i` remains positive for a large number of iterations of `i`.

3. **Invariant Related to Conditional Checks:**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "When the binary representation of `t = N - P * i` tends to have more 1s than the current `i`, the condition checking leads to the loop completing its full range without an early exit."
   - **Explanation:** The condition `cnt <= i` is not satisfied often if `t` is such that its binary form is dense with 1s, causing more iterations and thus slowdown.

By understanding these invariants, one can infer that slowdowns occur primarily due to excessive iterations and repeated inner loop executions, both of which are exacerbated by certain input configurations where `N` and `P` are close in magnitude. These conditions can guide optimization strategies or help identify problematic input cases in a fuzzer.

### Phase 3: Implementing Performance-Characterizing Invariants in C++

Based on the natural language invariants derived earlier, we will create runtime checks in C++ to detect the conditions that lead to performance bottlenecks:

1. **Invariant Related to Loop Iterations:**
   - This invariant checks if the difference between `N` and `P` is small or non-existent, which may cause the loop to iterate many times.
   
   ```cpp
   void check_loop_invariant(int N, int P, int i) {
       if (P > 0 && (N - P * i > 0)) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to excessive loop iterations triggered!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Invariant Related to Binary Digit Counting:**
   - This invariant checks if the inner loop for counting binary ones is called excessively.
   
   ```cpp
   void check_binary_count_invariant(int iterations) {
       if (iterations > 1000000) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to excessive binary counting triggered!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Invariant Related to Conditional Checks:**
   - This invariant checks if the condition `cnt <= i && i <= N - P * i` is rarely satisfied, causing many loop iterations.
   
   ```cpp
   void check_condition_invariant(int cnt, int i, int t) {
       if (cnt > i && i <= t) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to unsatisfied condition triggered!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Integrating Checkers into the Original C++ Code

Now, let's integrate these runtime checks into the original program to detect performance bottlenecks effectively. We will place checks at strategic points to minimize overhead:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Function to check if the loop is taking too many iterations
void check_loop_invariant(int N, int P, int i) {
    if (P > 0 && (N - P * i > 0)) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to excessive loop iterations triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Function to check if binary digit counting is excessive
void check_binary_count_invariant(int iterations) {
    if (iterations > 1000000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to excessive binary counting triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Function to check if condition checks are causing performance issues
void check_condition_invariant(int cnt, int i, int t) {
    if (cnt > i && i <= t) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to unsatisfied condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    int N, P;
    scanf("%d%d", &N, &P);
    for (int i = 0; i <= 1000100; i++) {
        int t = N - P * i;

        // Check loop invariant before intensive computation
        check_loop_invariant(N, P, i);

        int cnt = 0;
        int iterations = 0; // Track iterations within the while loop

        while (t) {
            cnt += t % 2;
            t /= 2;
            iterations++;
        }

        // Check binary count invariant after the while loop
        check_binary_count_invariant(iterations);

        if (cnt <= i && i <= N - P * i) {
            printf("%d\n", i);
            return 0;
        }

        // Check condition invariant after evaluating the condition
        check_condition_invariant(cnt, i, N - P * i);
    }
    printf("-1\n");
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Check Placement:** 
  - **`check_loop_invariant`:** Placed before entering the while loop to avoid unnecessary computation if the main loop iterates excessively.
  - **`check_binary_count_invariant`:** Placed immediately after the while loop to capture cases where the inner loop runs excessively.
  - **`check_condition_invariant`:** Placed after evaluating the condition to monitor cases where the condition is rarely satisfied, causing prolonged iterations.

- **Abort on Condition Trigger:** Each check, when triggered, will output a warning and abort the execution, clearly indicating a potential performance bottleneck. This helps in identifying problematic scenarios early during testing or fuzzing.
