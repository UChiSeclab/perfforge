### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

#### Analysis of Hit Counts:
1. **Loop Iteration (line 18):** 
   - **Slow Input:** 100,001 iterations
   - **Fast Input:** 1 iteration

2. **Binary Representation While Loop (line 21):**
   - **Slow Input:** 2,665,898 iterations
   - **Fast Input:** 2 iterations

3. **Inner For Loop (line 26):**
   - **Slow Input:** 2,665,898 iterations
   - **Fast Input:** 2 iterations

The most significant difference in execution is due to the loops that iterate over the binary representation of `n1` and within the outer loop iterating up to 100,000 times for the slow input but only once for the fast one.

#### Observation:
- The outer loop on line 18 iterates a large number of times (up to `1e5`), trying different values of `i`.
- The while loop (line 21) and subsequent inner loop (line 26) iterate over binary digits, which are more substantial for certain values of `n1`.
- The conditions checked at line 37 determine whether the loop breaks early; this condition fails much more frequently for the slow input.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **Invariant 1: Large Number of Iterations in Outer Loop**
   - **Natural Language:** "When `p` is close to `n` or results in small values of `n1` after `n - p*i`, the algorithm may iterate excessively without satisfying the conditions early and thus enter a slow path."
   - **Explanation:** If the product `p*i` closely matches `n` or results in a small `n1`, the loop may run many iterations without breaking, causing significant slowdown.

2. **Invariant 2: Large Binary Representation of `n1`**
   - **Natural Language:** "When the binary representation of `n1` involves many bits being set (i.e., when `n1` is large or has a complex binary structure), the computation of binary powers and summation conditions can induce slower execution."
   - **Explanation:** A complex binary representation of `n1` causes increased iterations in the inner loops, contributing to slower performance.

3. **Invariant 3: Large Power of Two Calculations**
   - **Natural Language:** "If calculating powers of two frequently within loops due to repeated division by 2 leads to extensive computations, the algorithm's performance may degrade."
   - **Explanation:** The function `binpow` could be called excessively when `n1` has significant binary complexity, increasing computation time.

By recognizing these invariants, one can understand and potentially predict scenarios under which the algorithm will exhibit slow performance. Adjusting the handling of these situations in the algorithm could help mitigate these bottlenecks.

### Phase 3: Implementing Performance-Characterizing Invariants in C++

Let's translate the natural language invariants into C++ checker code snippets.

#### Invariant 1: Large Number of Iterations in Outer Loop
```cpp
void check_large_iteration_invariant(long long p, long long n) {
    if (abs(p) >= n) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive loop iterations." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

#### Invariant 2: Large Binary Representation of `n1`
```cpp
void check_binary_representation_invariant(long long n1) {
    int bit_count = 0;
    long long temp = n1;
    while (temp != 0) {
        bit_count += temp % 2;
        temp /= 2;
    }
    if (bit_count > 20) { // Arbitrary threshold for significant binary complexity
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - complex binary representation." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrate Checks into the Original Program

Now, let's integrate these checks into the provided C++ program at appropriate locations.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Checker functions for performance bottlenecks
void check_large_iteration_invariant(long long p, long long n) {
    if (abs(p) >= n) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive loop iterations." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_binary_representation_invariant(long long n1) {
    int bit_count = 0;
    long long temp = n1;
    while (temp != 0) {
        bit_count += temp % 2;
        temp /= 2;
    }
    if (bit_count > 20) { // Arbitrary threshold for significant binary complexity
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - complex binary representation." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

long long binpow(long long a, long long n) {
    if (n == 0) return 1;
    if (n % 2 == 1)
        return binpow(a, n - 1) * a;
    else {
        long long b = binpow(a, n / 2);
        return b * b;
    }
}

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(0);
    cout.tie(0);
    long long n, p, v = 0, a = -1;
    cin >> n >> p;

    // Check for potential performance bottlenecks before entering the loop
    check_large_iteration_invariant(p, n);

    for (long long i = 1; i <= 1e5; ++i) {
        long long n1 = n - p * i;
        
        // Check binary representation complexity
        check_binary_representation_invariant(n1);

        vector<long long> ans;
        while (n1 != 0) {
            ans.push_back(n1 % 2);
            n1 /= 2;
        }
        long long cont = 0, p2 = 0;
        for (long long j = 0; j < ans.size(); ++j) {
            if (ans[j] == 1) {
                p2 += 1;
                long long o = binpow(2, j);
                if (o != 1) {
                    cont += binpow(2, j) / 2;
                } else {
                    cont += 1;
                }
            }
        }
        if (cont >= i && p2 <= i) {
            a = i;
            break;
        }
    }
    cout << a;
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of Integration
- **Invariant 1 Check:** Before entering the loop, we verify that the condition `abs(p) >= n` isn't met, which would lead to excessive iterations.
- **Invariant 2 Check:** Inside the loop, after calculating `n1`, we check its binary complexity and warn if it crosses a specified threshold. This helps detect when the binary representation might be too complex, leading to performance issues.
  
These checks help identify and abort execution when potential performance bottlenecks are triggered, aiding in debugging and optimization efforts.
