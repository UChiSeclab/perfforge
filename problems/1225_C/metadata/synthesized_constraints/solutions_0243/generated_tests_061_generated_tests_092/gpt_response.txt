### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Comparison of Hit Counts:**
   - The loop at line 16 is executed 100,000,001 times for the slow input but only once for the fast input. This indicates a significant difference in execution paths.
   - Lines 17, 18, and 19 are executed 100,000,000 times for the slow input, implying that the loop is mostly iterating without finding a valid solution.
   - The `deg` function is never called during the slow execution, while it is called once during the fast execution. This suggests that the condition `if (k <= 0 || k < i)` is stopping further processing early in the slow input.

2. **Interaction with Data Structures and Loops:**
   - The slow case indicates that the computation of `k = n - i * p` repeatedly results in values that do not satisfy the condition needed to proceed to the `deg` computation or further checks.
   - The outer loop's upper bound, `P`, which is `1e8`, signifies a potential for excessive computation if the exit condition is not met early.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **Invariant 1: Negative or Small Solutions**
   - **Natural Language Description:**
     "If the value `n - i * p` rapidly becomes non-positive or remains too small as `i` increases, the program will iterate through the entire loop range without making progress, causing a slowdown."
   - **Explanation:**
     This describes why the input pattern for `n = 3, p = 3` results in many iterations without invoking the costly `deg` function, as the result quickly falls below zero or is smaller than `i`, causing the loop to continue.

2. **Invariant 2: Inefficient Loop Termination**
   - **Natural Language Description:**
     "When `p` is such that the resulting subtraction `n - i * p` does not allow the loop to break early, and especially when `n` is small relative to `p`, the loop will execute nearly to its maximum bound, leading to inefficiency."
   - **Explanation:**
     This highlights the inefficiency in loop execution when the operation under the loop's logic fails to progress toward a solution, thus not triggering the `deg` function call.

3. **Invariant 3: Missed Early Termination Conditions**
   - **Natural Language Description:**
     "If for increasing `i`, the value calculated as `n - i * p` often meets the criteria `k <= 0 || k < i`, the loop will iterate excessively without executing the secondary condition checks, thereby degrading performance."
   - **Explanation:**
     This points out that if the condition check results in a continue for most iterations, performance deteriorates due to ineffective loop control.

These invariants help identify performance bottlenecks based on input characteristics and offer a guide for potential optimizations or adjustments in the algorithm to avoid such inefficiencies.

### Phase 3: Implementing the Natural Language Invariants in C++

For each invariant derived in Phase 2, I'll write a C++ checker function to detect the performance bottleneck conditions.

#### Invariant 1: Negative or Small Solutions

```cpp
void check_negative_or_small_solutions(long long k, long long i) {
    if (k <= 0 || k < i) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - negative or small k." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

#### Invariant 2: Inefficient Loop Termination

```cpp
void check_inefficient_loop_termination(long long n, long long p, long long i) {
    long long k = n - i * p;
    if (k > 0 && k < i && i > 1e7) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - inefficient loop termination." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

#### Invariant 3: Missed Early Termination Conditions

```cpp
void check_missed_early_termination(long long k, long long i) {
    if ((k <= 0 || k < i) && i > 1e7) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - missed early termination." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrating the Checkers into the Original Program

Next, I'll integrate these checkers into the provided C++ code at appropriate places to detect when these performance bottlenecks might be triggered.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
const long long P = 1e8;
long long n, p;

long long deg(long long k) {
    long long a = 0;
    while (k > 0) {
        a += k % 2;
        k /= 2;
    }
    return a;
}

// Checker functions for performance bottlenecks
void check_negative_or_small_solutions(long long k, long long i) {
    if (k <= 0 || k < i) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - negative or small k." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_inefficient_loop_termination(long long n, long long p, long long i) {
    long long k = n - i * p;
    if (k > 0 && k < i && i > 1e7) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - inefficient loop termination." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_missed_early_termination(long long k, long long i) {
    if ((k <= 0 || k < i) && i > 1e7) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - missed early termination." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    cin >> n >> p;
    long long ans = -1;
    for (long long i = 1; i <= P; i++) {
        long long k = n - i * p;

        // Insert invariant checks
        check_negative_or_small_solutions(k, i);
        check_inefficient_loop_termination(n, p, i);
        check_missed_early_termination(k, i);

        if (k <= 0 || k < i) {
            continue;
        }
        long long cnt = deg(k);
        if (cnt <= i) {
            ans = i;
            break;
        }
    }
    cout << ans;
    return 0;
}
```

### Comments for Each Check:
- **`check_negative_or_small_solutions`**: Detects when `k` becomes non-positive or too small to make further progress.
- **`check_inefficient_loop_termination`**: Detects if the loop is running inefficiently without meaningful termination, particularly for large `i`.
- **`check_missed_early_termination`**: Detects when early termination conditions are frequently met, but the loop is not broken efficiently. 

These checks ensure that the program aborts early when it detects potential inefficiencies based on the derived invariants, without adding overhead to the main computational loop.
