system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

Vasya will fancy any number as long as it is an integer power of two. Petya, on the other hand, is very conservative and only likes a single integer p (which may be positive, negative, or zero). To combine their tastes, they invented p-binary numbers of the form 2^x + p, where x is a non-negative integer.

For example, some -9-binary ("minus nine" binary) numbers are: -8 (minus eight), 7 and 1015 (-8=2^0-9, 7=2^4-9, 1015=2^{10}-9).

The boys now use p-binary numbers to represent everything. They now face a problem: given a positive integer n, what's the smallest number of p-binary numbers (not necessarily distinct) they need to represent n as their sum? It may be possible that representation is impossible altogether. Help them solve this problem.

For example, if p=0 we can represent 7 as 2^0 + 2^1 + 2^2.

And if p=-9 we can represent 7 as one number (2^4-9).

Note that negative p-binary numbers are allowed to be in the sum (see the Notes section for an example).

Input

The only line contains two integers n and p (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, -1000 ≤ p ≤ 1000).

Output

If it is impossible to represent n as the sum of any number of p-binary numbers, print a single integer -1. Otherwise, print the smallest possible number of summands.

Note

0-binary numbers are just regular binary powers, thus in the first sample case we can represent 24 = (2^4 + 0) + (2^3 + 0).

In the second sample case, we can represent 24 = (2^4 + 1) + (2^2 + 1) + (2^0 + 1).

In the third sample case, we can represent 24 = (2^4 - 1) + (2^2 - 1) + (2^2 - 1) + (2^2 - 1). Note that repeated summands are allowed.

In the fourth sample case, we can represent 4 = (2^4 - 7) + (2^1 - 7). Note that the second summand is negative, which is allowed.

In the fifth sample case, no representation is possible.

assistant: ### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Compare Line-Level Hit Counts:**
   - The `for` loop on line 22 is hit 2,000,001 times for the slow input and only once for the fast input. This indicates a significant performance bottleneck.
   - The inner loop on line 25, which runs up to 40 iterations, is hit 82,000,000 times for the slow input compared to 41 times for the fast input.
   - Line 26 is hit 80,000,000 times during the slow input run, showing that the operation `(m >> j) & 1` is executed excessively.

2. **Pinpoint Lines or Functions with More Hits:**
   - Lines 22 through 28 are critical areas where slow performance manifests due to excessive loop iterations. The check on line 28 (`if (value <= i && i <= m)`) is crucial because its failure leads the code to continue the outer loop, driving up hit counts.

3. **Inference on Data Interaction:**
   - The outer loop (line 22) iterates over a range of 2,000,000, attempting to find a valid combination of p-binary numbers.
   - The inner loop (line 25) checks each bit in a potential representation of `m` (derived from `n` and `p * i`) to count how many powers of two would be needed, increasing computational cost.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **Natural Language Invariants:**

   - **Excessive Iteration Invariant:** 
     - "When `p` is small relative to `n`, the outer loop may iterate over a vast range without finding a valid solution quickly. This occurs because too many potential combinations of `p-binary` numbers are checked, leading to excessive iteration without successful termination."
   
   - **Excessive Bit-Checking Invariant:**
     - "When the condition `(value <= i && i <= m)` frequently fails, the function repeatedly checks the bits of large numbers `m`, causing the inner loop to iterate intensively over all bit positions, significantly hampering performance."
     
2. **Avoid Hardcoding, Use Thresholds:**
   - Instead of using specific numbers from the slow input, describe conditions broadly enough to apply to future scenarios considering the input constraints (e.g., n ≤ 100).

3. **Correlate Conditions to Input Patterns:**
   - **Slow Path Trigger:** The slow path is triggered when `p` results in large values of `m` or when `m` is close to zero but requires multiple powers of two. The loop iterates extensively, incrementing `i` with little progress toward satisfying the condition `value <= i`.
   
4. **Concise Descriptive Set of Statements:**
   - "When the resultant `m` from subtracting multiples of `p` is large relative to the required `i`, the computation becomes intensive due to excessive iterations for binary decomposition."
   - "If the bit-checking does not reduce the problem space significantly due to an ineffective decrement in `m`, performance suffers due to large iteration counts without convergence."

These invariants provide a conceptual understanding of performance bottlenecks in the code and help identify scenarios where the solution may require optimization or alternative approaches to handle inputs more efficiently.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
Vasya will fancy any number as long as it is an integer power of two. Petya, on the other hand, is very conservative and only likes a single integer p (which may be positive, negative, or zero). To combine their tastes, they invented p-binary numbers of the form 2^x + p, where x is a non-negative integer.

For example, some -9-binary ("minus nine" binary) numbers are: -8 (minus eight), 7 and 1015 (-8=2^0-9, 7=2^4-9, 1015=2^{10}-9).

The boys now use p-binary numbers to represent everything. They now face a problem: given a positive integer n, what's the smallest number of p-binary numbers (not necessarily distinct) they need to represent n as their sum? It may be possible that representation is impossible altogether. Help them solve this problem.

For example, if p=0 we can represent 7 as 2^0 + 2^1 + 2^2.

And if p=-9 we can represent 7 as one number (2^4-9).

Note that negative p-binary numbers are allowed to be in the sum (see the Notes section for an example).

Input

The only line contains two integers n and p (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, -1000 ≤ p ≤ 1000).

Output

If it is impossible to represent n as the sum of any number of p-binary numbers, print a single integer -1. Otherwise, print the smallest possible number of summands.

Note

0-binary numbers are just regular binary powers, thus in the first sample case we can represent 24 = (2^4 + 0) + (2^3 + 0).

In the second sample case, we can represent 24 = (2^4 + 1) + (2^2 + 1) + (2^0 + 1).

In the third sample case, we can represent 24 = (2^4 - 1) + (2^2 - 1) + (2^2 - 1) + (2^2 - 1). Note that repeated summands are allowed.

In the fourth sample case, we can represent 4 = (2^4 - 7) + (2^1 - 7). Note that the second summand is negative, which is allowed.

In the fifth sample case, no representation is possible.

Solution (C++ code):
{solution}


assistant: ### Phase 3: Implementing Performance-Characterizing Invariants in C++

Based on the natural language invariants derived earlier, we will implement runtime checks using C++ to help identify when the code is likely to enter a performance bottleneck.

1. **Excessive Iteration Check:**

```cpp
void check_excessive_iteration(long long i, long long m) {
    if (i > 1000000 && m > 0) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to excessive iteration!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

2. **Excessive Bit-Checking Check:**

```cpp
void check_excessive_bit_checking(long long value, long long i, long long m) {
    if (value > i || i > m) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to excessive bit-checking!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrating Checkers into the C++ Program

We will integrate these checks into the original program at suitable points to ensure they do not add overhead in tight loops, while still effectively monitoring the conditions for performance bottlenecks.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Function to check excessive iteration condition
void check_excessive_iteration(long long i, long long m) {
    if (i > 1000000 && m > 0) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to excessive iteration!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Function to check excessive bit-checking condition
void check_excessive_bit_checking(long long value, long long i, long long m) {
    if (value > i || i > m) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to excessive bit-checking!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void solve() {

### Explanation of Integration Points:

- **Excessive Iteration Check:** Placed right after the if-statement on line 28. This ensures that we are monitoring the loop's progress without adding checks inside the most computationally expensive operations.

- **Excessive Bit-Checking Check:** Added after the calculation of `value` and before the if-statement on line 28. This ensures that we catch the potential bottleneck arising from the continuous failure of the condition `value <= i && i <= m`. 

These checks will help in identifying when the program enters conditions that could lead to slow execution, making it easier to diagnose and optimize these scenarios in future revisions.
