### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Compare Line-Level Hit Counts:**
   - The `for` loop on line 22 is hit 2,000,001 times for the slow input and only once for the fast input. This indicates a significant performance bottleneck.
   - The inner loop on line 25, which runs up to 40 iterations, is hit 82,000,000 times for the slow input compared to 41 times for the fast input.
   - Line 26 is hit 80,000,000 times during the slow input run, showing that the operation `(m >> j) & 1` is executed excessively.

2. **Pinpoint Lines or Functions with More Hits:**
   - Lines 22 through 28 are critical areas where slow performance manifests due to excessive loop iterations. The check on line 28 (`if (value <= i && i <= m)`) is crucial because its failure leads the code to continue the outer loop, driving up hit counts.

3. **Inference on Data Interaction:**
   - The outer loop (line 22) iterates over a range of 2,000,000, attempting to find a valid combination of p-binary numbers.
   - The inner loop (line 25) checks each bit in a potential representation of `m` (derived from `n` and `p * i`) to count how many powers of two would be needed, increasing computational cost.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **Natural Language Invariants:**

   - **Excessive Iteration Invariant:** 
     - "When `p` is small relative to `n`, the outer loop may iterate over a vast range without finding a valid solution quickly. This occurs because too many potential combinations of `p-binary` numbers are checked, leading to excessive iteration without successful termination."
   
   - **Excessive Bit-Checking Invariant:**
     - "When the condition `(value <= i && i <= m)` frequently fails, the function repeatedly checks the bits of large numbers `m`, causing the inner loop to iterate intensively over all bit positions, significantly hampering performance."
     
2. **Avoid Hardcoding, Use Thresholds:**
   - Instead of using specific numbers from the slow input, describe conditions broadly enough to apply to future scenarios considering the input constraints (e.g., n â‰¤ 100).

3. **Correlate Conditions to Input Patterns:**
   - **Slow Path Trigger:** The slow path is triggered when `p` results in large values of `m` or when `m` is close to zero but requires multiple powers of two. The loop iterates extensively, incrementing `i` with little progress toward satisfying the condition `value <= i`.
   
4. **Concise Descriptive Set of Statements:**
   - "When the resultant `m` from subtracting multiples of `p` is large relative to the required `i`, the computation becomes intensive due to excessive iterations for binary decomposition."
   - "If the bit-checking does not reduce the problem space significantly due to an ineffective decrement in `m`, performance suffers due to large iteration counts without convergence."

These invariants provide a conceptual understanding of performance bottlenecks in the code and help identify scenarios where the solution may require optimization or alternative approaches to handle inputs more efficiently.

### Phase 3: Implementing Performance-Characterizing Invariants in C++

Based on the natural language invariants derived earlier, we will implement runtime checks using C++ to help identify when the code is likely to enter a performance bottleneck.

1. **Excessive Iteration Check:**

```cpp
void check_excessive_iteration(long long i, long long m) {
    if (i > 1000000 && m > 0) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to excessive iteration!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

2. **Excessive Bit-Checking Check:**

```cpp
void check_excessive_bit_checking(long long value, long long i, long long m) {
    if (value > i || i > m) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to excessive bit-checking!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrating Checkers into the C++ Program

We will integrate these checks into the original program at suitable points to ensure they do not add overhead in tight loops, while still effectively monitoring the conditions for performance bottlenecks.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Function to check excessive iteration condition
void check_excessive_iteration(long long i, long long m) {
    if (i > 1000000 && m > 0) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to excessive iteration!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Function to check excessive bit-checking condition
void check_excessive_bit_checking(long long value, long long i, long long m) {
    if (value > i || i > m) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to excessive bit-checking!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void solve() {
    long long n, p;
    cin >> n >> p;
    for (int i = 1; i <= 2000000; i++) {
        long long m = n - p * i;
        long long value = 0;
        for (int j = 0; j < 40; j++) {
            if ((m >> j) & 1) value += 1;
        }
        check_excessive_bit_checking(value, i, m); // Check for excessive bit-checking
        
        if (value <= i && i <= m) {
            cout << i;
            return;
        }
        check_excessive_iteration(i, m); // Check for excessive iteration
    }
    cout << -1;
}

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
    cin.tie(nullptr);
    cout.tie(nullptr);
    solve();
}
```

### Explanation of Integration Points:

- **Excessive Iteration Check:** Placed right after the if-statement on line 28. This ensures that we are monitoring the loop's progress without adding checks inside the most computationally expensive operations.

- **Excessive Bit-Checking Check:** Added after the calculation of `value` and before the if-statement on line 28. This ensures that we catch the potential bottleneck arising from the continuous failure of the condition `value <= i && i <= m`. 

These checks will help in identifying when the program enters conditions that could lead to slow execution, making it easier to diagnose and optimize these scenarios in future revisions.
