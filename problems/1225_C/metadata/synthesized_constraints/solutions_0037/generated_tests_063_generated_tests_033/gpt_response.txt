## Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

### Analysis of Hit Counts:

1. **Line 38:** This line, which initiates a loop, is hit 1,000,001 times in the slow input and only once for the fast input. This indicates that the loop iterates a million times in the slow case, causing the slowdown.

2. **Lines 39, 40, 47:** These lines are part of the loop from line 38 and are also hit 1,000,000 times for the slow input but only once for the fast input, suggesting that repeated calculations are performed inside this loop.

3. **Lines 41-45:** These lines are part of an inner loop. Line 41, which initiates the loop, is hit 52,000,000 times in the slow case but only 52 times in the fast case. This suggests that the inner loop iterates extensively in the slow input. 

4. **Line 42:** This line is a conditional check inside the inner loop, hit 51,000,000 times for the slow input, indicating it is frequently bypassing the logic that modifies variables `need`, `now`, and `needm` (lines 43-45).

### Inference:
- The primary bottleneck is the large number of iterations in the outer loop (line 38) and the inner loop (line 41). These loops perform extensive operations on the `now` variable and array `p`, especially when they interact with large values or a wide range of the loop counter `i`.

## Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

### Natural Language Performance Invariants:

1. **Excessive Iterations in Outer Loop:**
   - "When the product of `i` and `m` approaches or exceeds `n`, the outer loop iterates too many times, leading to significant performance degradation. This is exacerbated if `m` is large relative to `n`."

2. **High Iteration Count in Inner Loop:**
   - "If the difference between `n` and the product `i * m` results in a value that requires multiple powers of two near the maximum possible (i.e., close to 2^50), the inner loop iterates many times, significantly slowing down the program."

3. **Unproductive Iterations in Conditional Check:**
   - "When many iterations of the inner loop result in the condition `p[j] > now` being true, the loop spends excessive time bypassing logic without reducing `now`, which indicates inefficiencies in processing numbers that are not easily decomposable into the required summands."

### Generalization and Threshold Consideration:
- The thresholds primarily concern the relationship between `n`, `m`, and the powers of two. Specifically, inefficiencies arise when `n` is difficult to represent with available `p-binary` numbers due to `m` being a constraining factor or when `n` lies just below large powers of two requiring complex summand combinations.
- Considering `n` is capped at 10^9 and `p` ranges from -1000 to 1000, these thresholds are indicative of what occurs when `m` is non-zero and small compared to `n`, leading to extensive iteration in an attempt to decompose `n`.

These performance-characterizing invariants describe general patterns that can lead to slow execution, abstracted from specific input values, and applicable to any valid input within given constraints.

## Phase 3: Implement the Natural Language Invariants in C++

Here, I'll translate the performance-characterizing invariants into C++ code snippets to check for these conditions at runtime.

### Invariant 1: Excessive Iterations in Outer Loop

```cpp
void check_excessive_iterations(long long i, long long m, long long n) {
    if (i * m >= n) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive iterations in outer loop!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Invariant 2: High Iteration Count in Inner Loop

```cpp
void check_high_inner_iterations(long long now, int j) {
    if (now > 0 && j <= 0) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high iteration count in inner loop!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Invariant 3: Unproductive Iterations in Conditional Check

```cpp
void check_unproductive_iterations(long long now, int p_j) {
    if (p_j > now) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - unproductive iterations in inner loop!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

## Phase 4: Insert Conditional Checks into the Program

Now, let's integrate these checks into the original C++ program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

const int MAXN = 1e6 + 2;
const int MAXM = 1e5 + 10;

long long inline in() {
    long long x = 0, flag = 1;
    char ch = getchar();
    while (ch < '0' || ch > '9') {
        if (ch == '-') flag = -1;
        ch = getchar();
    }
    while (ch >= '0' && ch <= '9')
        x = (x << 3) + (x << 1) + (ch ^ 48), ch = getchar();
    return x * flag;
}

void check_excessive_iterations(long long i, long long m, long long n) {
    if (i * m >= n) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive iterations in outer loop!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_high_inner_iterations(long long now, int j) {
    if (now > 0 && j <= 0) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high iteration count in inner loop!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_unproductive_iterations(long long now, long long p_j) {
    if (p_j > now) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - unproductive iterations in inner loop!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int head[MAXN], nume;
struct Adj {
    int nex, to, w;
} adj[MAXM << 1];

void addedge(int from, int to, int w) {
    adj[++nume] = (Adj){head[from], to, w};
    head[from] = nume;
}

void link(int u, int v, int w) {
    addedge(u, v, w);
    addedge(v, u, w);
}

long long n, m;
long long p[60];

int main() {
    n = in();
    m = in();
    p[0] = 1;
    for (int i = 1; i <= 50; ++i) {
        p[i] = p[i - 1] * 2;
    }
    long long ans = 1e18;
    for (long long i = 1; i <= 1000000; ++i) {
        long long now = n - i * m;
        check_excessive_iterations(i, m, n);  // Check for excessive iterations

        long long need = 0, needm = 0;
        for (int j = 50; j >= 0; --j) {
            check_high_inner_iterations(now, j);  // Check for high iterations in the inner loop

            if (p[j] > now) {
                check_unproductive_iterations(now, p[j]);  // Check for unproductive iterations
                continue;
            }
            ++need;
            now -= p[j];
            needm += p[j];
        }
        if (now != 0) continue;
        if (need <= i && i <= needm) {
            ans = min(ans, i);
            break;
        }
    }
    if (ans == 1000000000000000000)
        printf("-1");
    else
        printf("%lld\n", ans);
    return 0;
}
```

### Notes on Insertion
- The checks for excessive iterations are placed just after the loop variable is modified.
- The checks for high iteration counts and unproductive iterations are integrated within the inner loop where they reflect conditions leading to unproductive computation.
