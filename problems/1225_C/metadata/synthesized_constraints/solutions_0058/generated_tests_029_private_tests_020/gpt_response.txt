### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

From the hit count analysis, the main observations are:

1. The loop on line 6 (`for (int i = 0; i <= 1000000; i++)`) runs significantly more times for the slow input than the fast input. Specifically, it runs 1,000,002 times for the slow input versus just 2 times for the fast input.

2. The inner `while` loop on line 9, which counts the number of 1-bits in the binary representation of `tmp`, is executed approximately 29 million times for the slow input but only 13 times for the fast input. This suggests that `tmp` has a larger initial value or takes more iterations to reach zero in the slow input.

3. The condition check on line 13 (`if (cnt <= i && i <= n - p * i)`) is evaluated many times for the slow input but only successfully exits early for the fast input.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants (Natural Language)

Based on the above observations, the performance-characterizing invariants can be described as follows:

1. **Large Effective Loop Iterations Due to Input Parameters**: 
   - **Invariant**: "When the value of `n - p * i` remains large for many values of `i`, the loop may iterate close to its upper limit, significantly increasing execution time."
   - **Explanation**: The slowdown is triggered when the expression `n - p * i` does not quickly approach a value that satisfies the condition `cnt <= i`. This is more likely to occur when `p` is close to or larger than `n`, making the decrement per iteration small and requiring many iterations to make progress.

2. **High Bit Count Computation Repetitions**:
   - **Invariant**: "If the `tmp` value has a large number of bits set to 1 over many iterations, the program may perform excessive bit-count computations."
   - **Explanation**: The `while` loop counting set bits runs more frequently when `tmp` has many 1-bits, especially if `tmp` remains large across many loop iterations due to insufficient reductions in its value.

3. **Lack of Early Termination in Loop**:
   - **Invariant**: "When the value of `i` required to satisfy the condition `cnt <= i` is large, the program may not find a valid solution early and will iterate extensively."
   - **Explanation**: If both parts of the condition `cnt <= i` and `i <= n - p * i` are rarely satisfied early, the loop will continue to its maximum iterations, slowing down performance.

These invariants provide a general understanding of the conditions that lead to slow execution without directly referencing specific slow input values, ensuring they can help identify slow performance scenarios in future cases with similar characteristics.

### Phase 3: Implementing Invariants as Checker Code in C++

Here, I will implement runtime checks for the natural language invariants derived previously. Each check will be a function or inline condition that validates a particular anticipated performance bottleneck.

#### Invariant Check 1: Large Effective Loop Iterations Due to Input Parameters

This checks if `n - p * i` remains large for many iterations, potentially causing the loop to reach its maximum iteration count.

```cpp
void check_large_loop_iterations(int n, int p, int i) {
    if (i > 0 && n - p * i > 0 && n / p <= i) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large loop iterations due to input parameters!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

#### Invariant Check 2: High Bit Count Computation Repetitions

This checks if the `tmp` value frequently contains many bits set to 1 across iterations, indicating excessive bit count operations.

```cpp
void check_high_bit_count(int tmp) {
    int bitCount = 0;
    int temp = tmp;
    while (temp) {
        bitCount += temp % 2;
        temp /= 2;
    }
    if (bitCount > 30) { // Arbitrary threshold for excessive bit count
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high bit count computation repetitions!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

#### Invariant Check 3: Lack of Early Termination in Loop

This check flags if no valid condition is met early, causing the loop to potentially iterate to its maximum.

```cpp
void check_lack_of_early_termination(int cnt, int i, int n, int p) {
    if (cnt > i || i > n - p * i) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - lack of early termination in loop!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrating Checkers into the Original C++ Program

Now, I will integrate the above checkers into the given C++ code while ensuring they do not introduce performance degradation.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

void check_large_loop_iterations(int n, int p, int i) {
    if (i > 0 && n - p * i > 0 && n / p <= i) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large loop iterations due to input parameters!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_high_bit_count(int tmp) {
    int bitCount = 0;
    int temp = tmp;
    while (temp) {
        bitCount += temp % 2;
        temp /= 2;
    }
    if (bitCount > 30) { // Arbitrary threshold for excessive bit count
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high bit count computation repetitions!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_lack_of_early_termination(int cnt, int i, int n, int p) {
    if (cnt > i || i > n - p * i) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - lack of early termination in loop!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    int n, p;
    scanf("%d%d", &n, &p);
    for (int i = 0; i <= 1000000; i++) {
        check_large_loop_iterations(n, p, i); // Check for large loop iterations

        int tmp = n - p * i;
        int cnt = 0;
        while (tmp) {
            cnt += tmp % 2;
            tmp /= 2;
        }

        check_high_bit_count(n - p * i); // Check for high bit count computation

        if (cnt <= i && i <= n - p * i) {
            printf("%d\n", i);
            return 0;
        }

        check_lack_of_early_termination(cnt, i, n, p); // Check for lack of early termination
    }
    printf("-1\n");
    return 0;
}
```

### Comments on Integration
- The checkers are placed strategically to avoid performance overhead. For instance, the check for large loop iterations is performed before performing operations within the loop.
- Each checker logs a warning message and aborts execution if a potential performance issue is detected, enabling easier identification and debugging of performance bottlenecks.
