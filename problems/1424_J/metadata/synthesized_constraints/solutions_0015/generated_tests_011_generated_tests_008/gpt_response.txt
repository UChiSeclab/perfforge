=== Invariants Response ===
To analyze the provided C program and derive performance-characterizing invariants, we will examine the line-level hit counts and determine which parts of the code contribute to the slowdown when using the slow input compared to the fast input.

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Identification of Heavily Hit Lines:**
   - **Line 12:** `for (int i = 2; i <= tmp; i++) check[i] = true;`  
     - **Slow Input Hit Count:** 1,000,000
     - **Fast Input Hit Count:** 10  
     - The initialization of the `check` array gets significantly more hits for the slow input, indicating that `tmp` is much larger.
   
   - **Line 13-15:**  
     - **Line 13:** `for (int i = 2; i * i <= tmp; i++) {`  
       - **Slow Input Hit Count:** 1,000
       - **Fast Input Hit Count:** 3  
     - **Line 15:** `for (int j = i * i; j <= tmp; j += i) check[j] = false;`  
       - **Slow Input Hit Count:** 2,122,216
       - **Fast Input Hit Count:** 7  
     - These lines are part of the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm, which marks non-prime numbers. The significantly higher hit counts suggest the algorithm runs for a larger number of iterations due to the higher value of `tmp`.

   - **Line 17-18:**  
     - **Line 17:** `for (int i = 2; i <= tmp; i++) {`  
       - **Slow Input Hit Count:** 1,000,000
       - **Fast Input Hit Count:** 10  
     - **Line 18:** `b[i] = (check[i] == true) + b[i - 1];`  
       - **Slow Input Hit Count:** 999,999
       - **Fast Input Hit Count:** 9  
     - These lines accumulate the number of primes up to `tmp`, which again has significantly more hits for the slow input due to the larger value of `tmp`.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Given the analysis above, we come up with the following performance-characterizing invariants in natural language:

1. **Invariant on `tmp` Size:**
   - Natural Language Description: "If `tmp` (the maximum value in input n_i) is large, particularly close to 10^6, the computation may slow significantly due to the initialization and processing of large arrays, especially within the Sieve of Eratosthenes."
   - This invariant captures the essence of lines 12, 13-15, 17-18, where operations are directly proportional to the size of `tmp`.

2. **Invariant on Sieve Algorithm Execution:**
   - Natural Language Description: "The Sieve of Eratosthenes becomes a performance bottleneck when the input maximum (tmp) allows for large prime calculations, leading to excessive iterations and memory usage."
   - This invariant reflects the extensive loop iterations in lines 13-15 that mark non-prime numbers, exacerbated by larger values `tmp`.

3. **Invariant on Prime Count Accumulation:**
   - Natural Language Description: "When the upper limit of the input numbers (tmp) approaches the constraint maximum, the accumulation of prime numbers up to this limit can significantly increase execution time."
   - This relates to lines 17-18 where the calculation of prime counts up to `tmp` becomes costly as `tmp` increases.

By adhering to these performance-characterizing invariants, we can identify conditions under which the program is likely to enter a slow path, allowing for potential optimizations or early warnings during large input scenarios.

=== Checker Response ===
To incorporate performance-characterizing invariants into the provided C++ code, we'll follow the tasks outlined in Phase 3 and Phase 4.

### Phase 3: Implement Invariants as Checker Code in C++

Below, we translate the natural language invariants into C++ checker functions:

1. **Invariant on `tmp` Size:**

```cpp
void check_tmp_size_invariant(int tmp) {
    if (tmp >= 1000000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large value of tmp!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

2. **Invariant on Sieve Algorithm Execution:**

```cpp
void check_sieve_invariant(int tmp) {
    if (tmp >= 1000000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - extensive sieve operations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

3. **Invariant on Prime Count Accumulation:**

```cpp
void check_prime_count_invariant(int tmp) {
    if (tmp >= 1000000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - costly prime accumulation!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrate the Checker Code into the Original Program

Next, we'll incorporate these checks into the provided C++ program, ensuring to place the checks outside of tight loops to avoid adding unnecessary overhead.

Here is the instrumented program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int a[1000005], b[1000005];
bool check[1000005];

void check_tmp_size_invariant(int tmp) {
    if (tmp >= 1000000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large value of tmp!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_sieve_invariant(int tmp) {
    if (tmp >= 1000000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - extensive sieve operations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_prime_count_invariant(int tmp) {
    if (tmp >= 1000000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - costly prime accumulation!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    int n, tmp = 0;
    cin >> n;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        cin >> a[i];
        tmp = max(tmp, a[i]);
    }

    // Check the invariants after determining 'tmp'
    check_tmp_size_invariant(tmp);

    for (int i = 2; i <= tmp; i++) check[i] = true;
    for (int i = 2; i * i <= tmp; i++) {
        if (check[i] == true)
            for (int j = i * i; j <= tmp; j += i) check[j] = false;
    }
    
    // Check sieve invariant after initialization
    check_sieve_invariant(tmp);
    
    for (int i = 2; i <= tmp; i++) {
        b[i] = (check[i] == true) + b[i - 1];
    }

    // Check prime count accumulation invariant
    check_prime_count_invariant(tmp);

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        int cnt = sqrt(a[i]);
        cout << b[a[i]] - b[cnt] + 1 << " ";
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

- **`check_tmp_size_invariant`** is placed after determining the maximum value `tmp` from the input. This ensures we're aware of any potential large values early in the computation.
- **`check_sieve_invariant`** is placed after completing the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm, where extensive operations are performed based on `tmp`.
- **`check_prime_count_invariant`** follows the prime count accumulation loop to catch any issues with costly operations due to large `tmp`.

These checks will help detect conditions that lead to slow execution, aligning with the performance bottlenecks identified earlier.
