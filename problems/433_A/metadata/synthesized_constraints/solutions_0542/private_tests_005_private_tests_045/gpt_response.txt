=== Invariants Response ===
To address the performance issue in the C program provided for splitting apples, we must analyze the code's behavior, especially focusing on the differences between the fast and slow inputs based on the hit count information. Let's go through the analysis and derive performance-characterizing invariants.

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

#### Key Observations
1. **Nested Loop Analysis**:
   - The nested loop structure on lines 17-19 is where most of the hit counts concentrate, especially notable with the slow input.
   - The slow input causes the inner loop to execute 20,100 times, while the fast input only executes 804 times.

2. **Data Dependency**:
   - The outer loop iterates over the number of apples `n` (up to 100), while the inner loop iterates over potential sum values up to 200.
   - The condition `if (dp[j - a[i]]) dp[j] = 1;` suggests that the computation complexity is heavily influenced by the distribution and count of `100`-gram and `200`-gram apples.

3. **Effect of Sum Calculation**:
   - The sum of apple weights (multiplied by the loop mechanism) appears to have a significant role in determining execution time, especially when the sum is large and requires many updates to the `dp` array.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the above analysis, we can define the following conditions or invariants that are likely to trigger the slow performance paths:

#### Performance Invariants

1. **High Count of Apples and Maximum Possible Weight Combinations**:
   - **Natural Language Description**: "If the number of apples is close to the upper constraint (n â‰ˆ 100) and the distribution includes a large number of `200`-gram apples, the exhaustive checks for equal division may lead to significant slowdowns."
   
   This captures the scenario where the possibilities for splitting the total weight increase the workload on the dynamic programming approach.

2. **Complex Weight Distributions**:
   - **Natural Language Description**: "When the weight total is large and consists of many heavy (200 g) apples, the number of potential combinations to check for equal distribution grows, increasing execution time."
   
   This reflects that large sums, particularly those that necessitate exploring many partition possibilities, increase the time complexity sharply.

3. **Dynamic Programming Array Saturation**:
   - **Natural Language Description**: "If a broader range of possible weight sums is activated in the dynamic programming array due to varied apple combinations, the checking process becomes more extensive, slowing down the execution."
   
   This condition arises when the `dp` array is densely populated with possible sums, leading to more computations during array updates.

By understanding these invariants, developers and fuzzers can identify inputs that might lead to performance issues, ensuring that the C program is evaluated comprehensively for efficiency even under worst-case input scenarios.

=== Checker Response ===
### Phase 3: Implementing Natural Language Invariants in C++

Based on the performance-characterizing invariants identified earlier, we will implement checker functions to monitor potential performance bottlenecks.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Checker function to monitor high count of apples and weight distribution
void check_apple_count_and_distribution(int n, int num_200g) {
    if (n >= 95 && num_200g > n / 2) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high apple count and many 200g apples!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Checker function to monitor complex weight distributions
void check_weight_distribution(int sum, int num_200g) {
    if (sum > 150 && num_200g > sum / 2) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - complex weight distribution!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Checker function to monitor dynamic programming array saturation
void check_dp_saturation(bool *dp, int sum) {
    int active_states = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i <= sum; ++i) {
        if (dp[i]) ++active_states;
    }
    if (active_states > 150) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - DP array saturation!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrating Checkers into the Original Program

Now, let's integrate these checker functions into the original C++ program to effectively monitor the performance when processing inputs.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
const int MAX = 205;
int a[MAX];
bool dp[MAX];

// Checker functions (as defined in Phase 3)
void check_apple_count_and_distribution(int n, int num_200g);
void check_weight_distribution(int sum, int num_200g);
void check_dp_saturation(bool *dp, int sum);

int main() {
    int n;
    scanf("%d", &n);
    int num_200g = 0;
    int sum = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        scanf("%d", &a[i]);
        if (a[i] == 200) {
            num_200g++;
        }
        a[i] /= 100;
        sum += a[i];
    }

    // Add checkers after reading inputs
    check_apple_count_and_distribution(n, num_200g);
    check_weight_distribution(sum, num_200g);

    dp[0] = 1;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        for (int j = 200; j >= 1; --j) {
            if (dp[j - a[i]]) dp[j] = 1;
        }
    }

    // Check for DP saturation just before the final decision
    check_dp_saturation(dp, sum);

    if (sum % 2 || !dp[sum / 2])
        printf("NO\n");
    else
        printf("YES\n");
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of Integration

- **Checkers Placement**: The checkers are placed right after reading the input and computing initial values. This ensures that any potential bottleneck conditions are flagged early in the execution without interfering with the core computation loop.
- **Checker Conditions**: Each checker function is tailored to monitor aspects such as high amounts of 200g apples, complex weight distributions, and the saturation of the dynamic programming array.
- **Abort on Detection**: Each checker will output a warning and abort the program if a bottleneck condition is triggered, helping identify problematic input patterns for further optimization.
