To diagnose the performance bottleneck in the provided C program, let's analyze the hit count data and identify the expensive segments in the code.

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive Code Segments

**Line-Level Hit Count Analysis:**

1. **Outer Loop (Line 10):**  
   - Slow Input: 101 hits
   - Fast Input: 33 hits

   The outer loop runs for each apple, so naturally, the hit count is high for both inputs, especially for the slow input, where `n` is 100 compared to 32 in the fast input.

2. **Inner Loop (Line 15):**
   - Slow Input: 100100 hits
   - Fast Input: 32032 hits

   There is a significant increase in hits for the slow input compared to the fast input, suggesting the inner loop (`for (int t = 1000 - 1; t >= 0; t--)`) is a major contributor to the slowdown. The inner loop iterates 1000 times for each apple, leading to a large number of iterations, particularly when `n` is large or when the sums being tracked are close to 1000.

3. **Conditional Update (Line 16):**
   - Slow Input: 100000 hits
   - Fast Input: 32000 hits

   This conditional update within the inner loop is executed almost every time the loop runs, indicating that many elements in the `can` array are being checked and updated.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **Natural Language Invariant #1:**
   - **Description:** When the number of apples `n` approaches the upper limit and consists mostly of 200-gram apples, the algorithm's inner loop executes excessively, leading to significant slowdowns.
   - **Explanation:** The hit count analysis indicates the inner loop's execution time increases drastically with more 200-gram apples, especially when `n` is large, as this increases the range of sums to be checked for possible splits.

2. **Natural Language Invariant #2:**
   - **Description:** If the apple weights result in high cumulative sums that require the `can` array to be frequently updated over a large range, the performance is degraded.
   - **Explanation:** The frequent and widespread updates to the `can` array suggest that maintaining possible partitions is computationally intensive, especially when the sum of the apple weights reaches high values near the capacity of the `can` array (i.e., 1000).

3. **Natural Language Invariant #3:**
   - **Description:** A slowdown occurs when the distribution of apples is such that there are few ways to split them evenly, causing repeated and extensive searching through potential weight combinations.
   - **Explanation:** When the sum of weights is not easily divisible or when most apples are of the same type, the algorithm spends more time evaluating many permutations of weight combinations.

These invariants capture the conditions under which the program experiences performance bottlenecks and are broad enough to anticipate similar issues with other inputs within the constraint that `n <= 100`. By abstracting the issue to focus on the distribution and type of apple weights, these conditions highlight the factors leading to excessive computational overhead.

### Phase 3: Implement the Natural Language Invariants as C++ Checkers

Below are the C++ implementations of the natural language invariants derived in Phase 2. Each checker is designed to detect the condition described in the invariant.

1. **Checker for Invariant #1: Large Number of 200-gram Apples**

```cpp
void check_large_200_gram_apples(int n, int count_200) {
    if (n == 100 && count_200 > 70) { // Adjusted threshold based on inferred condition
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - too many 200-gram apples" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

2. **Checker for Invariant #2: Frequent Updates to `can` Array**

```cpp
void check_frequent_updates(int potential_updates) {
    if (potential_updates > 50000) { // Example threshold for excessive updates
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - too many updates to 'can' array" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

3. **Checker for Invariant #3: Difficult Weight Partitioning**

```cpp
void check_difficult_partitioning(int sum) {
    if (sum > 900) { // Example threshold where partitioning becomes challenging
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - difficult weight partitioning" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrate the Checkers into the Original Program

Now, we will integrate these checks into the given C++ program, placing them at strategic points to minimize runtime overhead.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Checker for Invariant #1
void check_large_200_gram_apples(int n, int count_200) {
    if (n == 100 && count_200 > 70) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - too many 200-gram apples" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Checker for Invariant #2
void check_frequent_updates(int potential_updates) {
    if (potential_updates > 50000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - too many updates to 'can' array" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Checker for Invariant #3
void check_difficult_partitioning(int sum) {
    if (sum > 900) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - difficult weight partitioning" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int a[400];
int can[1000];

int main() {
    int n;
    scanf("%d", &n);
    int s = 0;
    can[0] = 1;

    int count_200 = 0; // Count the number of 200-gram apples
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        int k;
        scanf("%d", &k);
        k /= 100;
        if (k == 2) count_200++; // Increment count for 200-gram apples

        s += k;

        int potential_updates = 0; // Track potential updates to 'can'
        for (int t = 1000 - 1; t >= 0; t--) {
            if (can[t]) {
                can[t + k] = 1;
                potential_updates++;
            }
        }
        check_frequent_updates(potential_updates); // Check for excessive updates
    }

    check_large_200_gram_apples(n, count_200); // Check for too many 200-gram apples
    check_difficult_partitioning(s); // Check for difficult partitioning
    
    if (s % 2)
        puts("NO");
    else {
        int p = s / 2;
        if (can[p])
            puts("YES");
        else
            puts("NO");
    }
    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation of Integration:**
- **Invariant #1:** Check after reading all inputs to see if there are too many 200-gram apples, which increases complexity.
- **Invariant #2:** Implemented inside the loop that updates the `can` array to monitor the potential number of updates and check if it crosses an excessive threshold.
- **Invariant #3:** Performed after calculating the total sum to detect potentially difficult partition cases.

These checks help identify conditions that may lead to performance degradation, aligning with the analysis conducted in earlier phases.
