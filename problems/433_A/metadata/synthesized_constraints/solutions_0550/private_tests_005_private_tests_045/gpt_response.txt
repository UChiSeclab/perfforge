=== Invariants Response ===
To analyze the performance bottlenecks of the provided C program, we will go through two phases as described in the task:

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Compare Line-Level Hit Counts:**
   - The line `for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++)` (line 18) gets significantly more hits in the slow input (100 hits) compared to the fast input (2 hits).
   - The inner loop `for (int j = i; j < n; j++)` (line 20) gets a very high number of hits (3757) in the slow run, indicating a nested loop issue.
   - Operations inside the inner loop, such as `sum2 += a[j]` (line 21) and condition checks like `if (sum2 < y)` (line 22) are also hit a large number of times, showing the nested loop iterates many times.

2. **Pinpoint Lines with Significant Hits:**
   - The lines inside the nested loop are the main performance bottlenecks.
   - The outer loop (line 18) and inner loop (line 20) contribute to high computational effort due to multiple iterations, especially with the condition checks (lines 22, 23, and 27) being evaluated repeatedly.

3. **Interaction with Data Structures:**
   - The array `a` is sorted once (line 17), but the main issue comes from the nested loops iterating over this sorted array.
   - The logic aims to find a subset of apples that sums up to half the total weight, resulting in potentially high computational complexity as the program evaluates many combinations.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the analysis, we can derive performance-characterizing invariants in natural language:

1. **Invariant #1: Nested Loop Traversal**
   - **Description:** "If the distribution of 100-gram and 200-gram apples requires exploring many combinations to find a balanced split, the program may slow significantly."
   - **Explanation:** This situation arises when there is no straightforward way to split the apples evenly, leading to exhaustive checks through the nested loops.

2. **Invariant #2: Complexity Due to Sorted Array Exploration**
   - **Description:** "If a sorted array leads to excessive search operations for a valid partition, especially near the bounds of the input constraints, performance may degrade."
   - **Explanation:** When the array must be exhaustively searched for a solution, especially if n is large (near 100), performance becomes an issue.

3. **Invariant #3: Input Pattern and Weight Distribution**
   - **Description:** "When the number of 200-gram apples significantly affects the partition sum, or when the mix of weights results in non-trivial combinations, the code may enter a slow path."
   - **Explanation:** A challenging weight distribution causes repeated evaluations in the nested loops, leading to performance bottlenecks.

By understanding these invariants, developers can appreciate under what conditions the program's performance might degrade and consider optimizing or restructuring the logic to handle such scenarios more efficiently.

### Phase 3: Implementing the Natural Language Invariants as Checker Code in C++

Based on the previously derived natural language invariants, here are the C++ code snippets that check each condition:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

// Invariant #1: Nested Loop Traversal
void check_nested_loop_invariant(int n, int operations) {
    if (operations > n * n) { // Arbitrarily assuming a threshold related to n^2
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to excessive nested loop operations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Invariant #2: Complexity Due to Sorted Array Exploration
void check_sorted_array_exploration(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Excessive search operations in sorted array!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Invariant #3: Input Pattern and Weight Distribution
void check_distribution_invariant(int count100, int count200, int n) {
    if (abs(count100 - count200) > n / 2) { // Arbitrary threshold based on n
        cerr << "Warning: Imbalanced distribution of apple weights!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrating the Checker Code with the Original Program

Here's the original C++ program with the new performance checkers integrated effectively:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
const int maxn = 105;
int a[maxn];

// Invariant #1: Nested Loop Traversal
void check_nested_loop_invariant(int n, int operations) {
    if (operations > n * n) { // Arbitrarily assuming a threshold related to n^2
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to excessive nested loop operations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Invariant #2: Complexity Due to Sorted Array Exploration
void check_sorted_array_exploration(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Excessive search operations in sorted array!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Invariant #3: Input Pattern and Weight Distribution
void check_distribution_invariant(int count100, int count200, int n) {
    if (abs(count100 - count200) > n / 2) { // Arbitrary threshold based on n
        cerr << "Warning: Imbalanced distribution of apple weights!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    int n;
    string s;
    while (cin >> n) {
        int flag = false;
        int sum = 0;
        int count100 = 0, count200 = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            cin >> a[i];
            sum += a[i];
            if (a[i] == 100) count100++;
            else count200++;
        }
        
        // Check input distribution
        check_distribution_invariant(count100, count200, n);

        int y = sum / 2;
        int sum2;
        sort(a, a + n);
        
        int operations = 0; // Track operations for nested loop invariant
        for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
            sum2 = 0;
            for (int j = i; j < n; j++) {
                sum2 += a[j];
                operations++;
                if (sum2 < y) continue;
                if (sum2 == y) {
                    flag = true;
                    break;
                }
                if (sum2 > y) break;
            }
            if (flag) break;
        }
        
        // Check nested loop operations
        check_nested_loop_invariant(n, operations);
        
        if (flag)
            cout << "YES" << endl;
        else
            cout << "NO" << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:

- **Invariant Check #1:** The `check_nested_loop_invariant` function checks if the number of operations in the nested loop exceeds a threshold related to \( n^2 \), warning of excessive iterations.
- **Invariant Check #2:** The `check_sorted_array_exploration` function could be used to detect excessive searching operations over the sorted array, though in this integration, the exact condition isn't implemented in this snippet but explained for wider applicability.
- **Invariant Check #3:** The `check_distribution_invariant` function warns if there is a significant imbalance in the distribution of 100-gram and 200-gram apples.

These checks are strategically placed after critical operations (such as sorting and distribution analysis) to avoid unnecessary overhead while ensuring performance bottlenecks are detected.
