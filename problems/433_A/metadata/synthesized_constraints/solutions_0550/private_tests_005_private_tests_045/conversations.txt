system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

Kitahara Haruki has bought n apples for Touma Kazusa and Ogiso Setsuna. Now he wants to divide all the apples between the friends.

Each apple weights 100 grams or 200 grams. Of course Kitahara Haruki doesn't want to offend any of his friend. Therefore the total weight of the apples given to Touma Kazusa must be equal to the total weight of the apples given to Ogiso Setsuna.

But unfortunately Kitahara Haruki doesn't have a knife right now, so he cannot split any apple into some parts. Please, tell him: is it possible to divide all the apples in a fair way between his friends?

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of apples. The second line contains n integers w1, w2, ..., wn (wi = 100 or wi = 200), where wi is the weight of the i-th apple.

Output

In a single line print "YES" (without the quotes) if it is possible to divide all the apples between his friends. Otherwise print "NO" (without the quotes).

Examples

Input

3
100 200 100


Output

YES


Input

4
100 100 100 200


Output

NO

Note

In the first test sample Kitahara Haruki can give the first and the last apple to Ogiso Setsuna and the middle apple to Touma Kazusa.

(F) Program Solving the Problem Statement

    for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
      sum2 = 0;
      for (int j = i; j < n; j++) {
        sum2 += a[j];
        if (sum2 < y) continue;
        if (sum2 == y) {
          flag = true;
          break;
        }
        if (sum2 > y) break;
      }
      if (flag) break;
    }
    if (flag)

assistant: To analyze the performance bottlenecks of the provided C program, we will go through two phases as described in the task:

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Compare Line-Level Hit Counts:**
   - The line `for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++)` (line 18) gets significantly more hits in the slow input (100 hits) compared to the fast input (2 hits).
   - The inner loop `for (int j = i; j < n; j++)` (line 20) gets a very high number of hits (3757) in the slow run, indicating a nested loop issue.
   - Operations inside the inner loop, such as `sum2 += a[j]` (line 21) and condition checks like `if (sum2 < y)` (line 22) are also hit a large number of times, showing the nested loop iterates many times.

2. **Pinpoint Lines with Significant Hits:**
   - The lines inside the nested loop are the main performance bottlenecks.
   - The outer loop (line 18) and inner loop (line 20) contribute to high computational effort due to multiple iterations, especially with the condition checks (lines 22, 23, and 27) being evaluated repeatedly.

3. **Interaction with Data Structures:**
   - The array `a` is sorted once (line 17), but the main issue comes from the nested loops iterating over this sorted array.
   - The logic aims to find a subset of apples that sums up to half the total weight, resulting in potentially high computational complexity as the program evaluates many combinations.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the analysis, we can derive performance-characterizing invariants in natural language:

1. **Invariant #1: Nested Loop Traversal**
   - **Description:** "If the distribution of 100-gram and 200-gram apples requires exploring many combinations to find a balanced split, the program may slow significantly."
   - **Explanation:** This situation arises when there is no straightforward way to split the apples evenly, leading to exhaustive checks through the nested loops.

2. **Invariant #2: Complexity Due to Sorted Array Exploration**
   - **Description:** "If a sorted array leads to excessive search operations for a valid partition, especially near the bounds of the input constraints, performance may degrade."
   - **Explanation:** When the array must be exhaustively searched for a solution, especially if n is large (near 100), performance becomes an issue.

3. **Invariant #3: Input Pattern and Weight Distribution**
   - **Description:** "When the number of 200-gram apples significantly affects the partition sum, or when the mix of weights results in non-trivial combinations, the code may enter a slow path."
   - **Explanation:** A challenging weight distribution causes repeated evaluations in the nested loops, leading to performance bottlenecks.

By understanding these invariants, developers can appreciate under what conditions the program's performance might degrade and consider optimizing or restructuring the logic to handle such scenarios more efficiently.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
Kitahara Haruki has bought n apples for Touma Kazusa and Ogiso Setsuna. Now he wants to divide all the apples between the friends.

Each apple weights 100 grams or 200 grams. Of course Kitahara Haruki doesn't want to offend any of his friend. Therefore the total weight of the apples given to Touma Kazusa must be equal to the total weight of the apples given to Ogiso Setsuna.

But unfortunately Kitahara Haruki doesn't have a knife right now, so he cannot split any apple into some parts. Please, tell him: is it possible to divide all the apples in a fair way between his friends?

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of apples. The second line contains n integers w1, w2, ..., wn (wi = 100 or wi = 200), where wi is the weight of the i-th apple.

Output

In a single line print "YES" (without the quotes) if it is possible to divide all the apples between his friends. Otherwise print "NO" (without the quotes).

Examples

Input

3
100 200 100


Output

YES


Input

4
100 100 100 200


Output

NO

Note

In the first test sample Kitahara Haruki can give the first and the last apple to Ogiso Setsuna and the middle apple to Touma Kazusa.

Solution (C++ code):
{solution}


assistant: ### Phase 3: Implementing the Natural Language Invariants as Checker Code in C++

Based on the previously derived natural language invariants, here are the C++ code snippets that check each condition:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

// Invariant #1: Nested Loop Traversal
void check_nested_loop_invariant(int n, int operations) {
    if (operations > n * n) { // Arbitrarily assuming a threshold related to n^2
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to excessive nested loop operations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Invariant #2: Complexity Due to Sorted Array Exploration
void check_sorted_array_exploration(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Excessive search operations in sorted array!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Invariant #3: Input Pattern and Weight Distribution
void check_distribution_invariant(int count100, int count200, int n) {
    if (abs(count100 - count200) > n / 2) { // Arbitrary threshold based on n
        cerr << "Warning: Imbalanced distribution of apple weights!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrating the Checker Code with the Original Program

Here's the original C++ program with the new performance checkers integrated effectively:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
const int maxn = 105;
int a[maxn];

// Invariant #1: Nested Loop Traversal
void check_nested_loop_invariant(int n, int operations) {
    if (operations > n * n) { // Arbitrarily assuming a threshold related to n^2
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to excessive nested loop operations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Invariant #2: Complexity Due to Sorted Array Exploration
void check_sorted_array_exploration(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Excessive search operations in sorted array!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Invariant #3: Input Pattern and Weight Distribution
void check_distribution_invariant(int count100, int count200, int n) {
    if (abs(count100 - count200) > n / 2) { // Arbitrary threshold based on n
        cerr << "Warning: Imbalanced distribution of apple weights!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    int n;
    string s;
    while (cin >> n) {
        int flag = false;
        int sum = 0;
        int count100 = 0, count200 = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {

### Explanation:

- **Invariant Check #1:** The `check_nested_loop_invariant` function checks if the number of operations in the nested loop exceeds a threshold related to \( n^2 \), warning of excessive iterations.
- **Invariant Check #2:** The `check_sorted_array_exploration` function could be used to detect excessive searching operations over the sorted array, though in this integration, the exact condition isn't implemented in this snippet but explained for wider applicability.
- **Invariant Check #3:** The `check_distribution_invariant` function warns if there is a significant imbalance in the distribution of 100-gram and 200-gram apples.

These checks are strategically placed after critical operations (such as sorting and distribution analysis) to avoid unnecessary overhead while ensuring performance bottlenecks are detected.
