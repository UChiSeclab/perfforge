=== Invariants Response ===
To analyze the performance differences between the "fast" and "slow" inputs and derive performance-characterizing invariants, we need to examine the code and hit count data closely.

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Comparison of Line-Level Hit Counts**:
   - The hit counts for lines 50 and 51 are significantly higher for the slow input compared to the fast input.
   - This indicates that the nested loop starting at line 50 runs considerably more times for the slow input.

2. **Pinpointing Inefficient Code Segments**:
   - **Lines 49-53**: This loop iterates `b` times, and within it, the inner loop iterates `N - 2` times.
   - The line `if (dp[j]) dp[j + 2] = 1;` indicates a dynamic programming approach to solving the partition problem.
   - For the slow input, `b` (number of 200 gram apples) is 99, whereas for the fast input, `b` is only 29. This higher value of `b` leads to much more computation in the nested loop.

3. **Reason for Increased Hit Counts**:
   - For the slow input, having a large number of 200 gram apples increases the iterations in the inner loop significantly, leading to larger hit counts and slower execution.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the above analysis, we can derive the following performance-characterizing invariants:

1. **Invariant 1: Large Number of 200 Gram Apples**:
   - **Natural Language Description**: "If the number of 200 gram apples is significantly large, especially close to the maximum possible value of n, the nested loop processing these apples may lead to slow execution."
   - This is because the loop iterates `b` times, and a large value for `b` increases the computational cost dramatically due to the double iteration over `N`.

2. **Invariant 2: Sum and Dynamic Programming Array Utilization**:
   - **Natural Language Description**: "If the total weight is such that it heavily utilizes the dynamic programming array, with many updates occurring, the performance may degrade due to extensive state management in the array."
   - This relates to the extensive updates to the `dp` array when the sum of weights causes many states to be explored in the array.

3. **Invariant 3: Imbalance in Weight Distribution**:
   - **Natural Language Description**: "When the distribution of apple weights leads to a large imbalance handled by the dynamic programming approach, the state space grows, potentially slowing down the execution."
   - This is when there is an imbalance in the number of 100 gram and 200 gram apples that challenges the partitioning logic.

By keeping these invariants in mind, one can anticipate and detect slow performance scenarios in similar inputs without direct reliance on specific numeric values from the examples given.

=== Checker Response ===
### Phase 3: Implement the Natural Language Invariants in C++

Here are the C++ code snippets to check each of the previously derived performance-characterizing invariants:

1. **Invariant 1: Large Number of 200 Gram Apples**
   ```cpp
   void check_200_gram_apples_invariant(int b) {
       if (b > 80) { // Assuming a threshold indicating a large number of 200 gram apples
           cerr << "Warning: Large number of 200 gram apples may cause slow execution!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Invariant 2: Sum and Dynamic Programming Array Utilization**
   ```cpp
   void check_dp_utilization_invariant(int sum) {
       if (sum > 150) { // Assuming a high sum can lead to large dp utilization
           cerr << "Warning: High sum value leading to extensive dp utilization!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Invariant 3: Imbalance in Weight Distribution**
   ```cpp
   void check_weight_distribution_invariant(int a, int b) {
       if (a < 10 && b > 90) { // Checking for imbalance (arbitrary example thresholds)
           cerr << "Warning: Imbalanced weight distribution may cause slow execution!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Integrate the Checker Code into the Original Program

Here's the instrumented C++ code for the provided solution, with the performance checks added at appropriate locations:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#pragma comment(linker, "/stack:102400000,102400000")
using namespace std;

const int N = 20003;
int n, a, b, sum, dp[N];

void init() {
  a = b = sum = 0;
  memset(dp, 0, sizeof(dp));
}

void get_data() {
  int t;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    scanf("%d", &t);
    if (t == 100) {
      a++;
      sum++;
    } else {
      b++;
      sum += 2;
    }
  }
}

void check_200_gram_apples_invariant(int b) {
    if (b > 80) { // Threshold for large number of 200 gram apples
        cerr << "Warning: Large number of 200 gram apples may cause slow execution!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_dp_utilization_invariant(int sum) {
    if (sum > 150) { // Threshold for high sum value
        cerr << "Warning: High sum value leading to extensive dp utilization!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_weight_distribution_invariant(int a, int b) {
    if (a < 10 && b > 90) { // Threshold for weight distribution imbalance
        cerr << "Warning: Imbalanced weight distribution may cause slow execution!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void solve() {
  int i, j;
  dp[0] = 1;
  
  check_200_gram_apples_invariant(b);
  check_dp_utilization_invariant(sum);
  check_weight_distribution_invariant(a, b);

  for (i = 0; i < a; ++i) {
    for (j = 0; j < N - 1; ++j) {
      if (dp[j]) dp[j + 1] = 1;
    }
  }
  for (i = 0; i < b; ++i) {
    for (j = 0; j < N - 2; ++j) {
      if (dp[j]) dp[j + 2] = 1;
    }
  }
  if (sum % 2 == 0 && dp[sum / 2])
    puts("YES");
  else
    puts("NO");
}

int main() {
  while (~scanf("%d", &n)) {
    init();
    get_data();
    solve();
  }
  return 0;
}
```

**Explanation of the Instrumented Code:**

- **`check_200_gram_apples_invariant`:** Added after computing the number of 200 gram apples (`b`).
- **`check_dp_utilization_invariant`:** Added before the dynamic programming loops to ensure `sum` is not excessively large.
- **`check_weight_distribution_invariant`:** Added to detect significant imbalance between the number of 100 gram and 200 gram apples.

These checks are strategically inserted before performance-critical loops and operations to help a fuzzer or developer quickly identify conditions leading to slow execution.
