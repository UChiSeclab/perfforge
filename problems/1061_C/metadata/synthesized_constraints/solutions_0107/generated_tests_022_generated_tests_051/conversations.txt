system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

You are given an integer array a_1, a_2, …, a_n.

The array b is called to be a subsequence of a if it is possible to remove some elements from a to get b.

Array b_1, b_2, …, b_k is called to be good if it is not empty and for every i (1 ≤ i ≤ k) b_i is divisible by i.

Find the number of good subsequences in a modulo 10^9 + 7. 

Two subsequences are considered different if index sets of numbers included in them are different. That is, the values ​of the elements ​do not matter in the comparison of subsequences. In particular, the array a has exactly 2^n - 1 different subsequences (excluding an empty subsequence).

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000) — the length of the array a.

The next line contains integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6).

Output

Print exactly one integer — the number of good subsequences taken modulo 10^9 + 7.

Note

In the first example, all three non-empty possible subsequences are good: \{1\}, \{1, 2\}, \{2\}

In the second example, the possible good subsequences are: \{2\}, \{2, 2\}, \{2, 22\}, \{2, 14\}, \{2\}, \{2, 22\}, \{2, 14\}, \{1\}, \{1, 22\}, \{1, 14\}, \{22\}, \{22, 14\}, \{14\}.

Note, that some subsequences are listed more than once, since they occur in the original array multiple times.

assistant: ## Phase 1: Identifying Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

Based on the provided line-level hit counts, we can identify the following key observations:

1. **Hit Count Discrepancy**:
   - Line 11 (`for (i = 1; i <= mx; ++i)`) and Line 12 (nested loop with `j += i`): In the slow input, line 11 is hit 965,897 times, while in the fast input it is hit 799,977 times. Similarly, line 12 is executed 14,425,886 times for the slow input, while only 11,797,044 times for the fast input.
   - Line 13 (`sort(x[i].begin(), x[i].end());`) is called 965,897 times for the slow input, compared to 799,977 times for the fast input.

2. **Analysis**:
   - The discrepancy suggests that the loops in lines 11-13 are very expensive. The key factor is the maximum value `mx` found in the input array, which determines how many times these loops run.
   - The inner loop (`j += i`) in line 12 is particularly costly, as it operates for every divisor `i` of numbers up to `mx`. This results in a number of operations proportional to the sum of the divisors of each number up to `mx`.
   - Sorting each vector `x[i]` in line 13 contributes significantly to the execution time, especially since this operation is repeated for each `i` up to `mx`.

## Phase 2: Deriving Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the analysis, here are several potential performance-characterizing invariants:

1. **Invariant 1: High Maximum Value in Array**:
   - **Natural Language Description**: "If the maximum value in the array (`mx`) is very large, the loop that collects divisors and subsequent sorting operations may become very expensive."
   - **Implication**: When `mx` is large, each integer from 1 up to `mx` will be processed, leading to many operations in both the divisor collection and sorting steps.

2. **Invariant 2: High Number of Divisors**:
   - **Natural Language Description**: "If numbers in the array have many divisors, the cumulative cost of processing each divisor in nested loops can increase significantly."
   - **Implication**: Numbers with many divisors lead to more iterations in the inner loop (`j += i`), thereby increasing the computational load.

3. **Invariant 3: Expensive Sorting Operations**:
   - **Natural Language Description**: "If the divisor collection vectors become large, frequent sorting operations on these vectors can significantly increase execution time."
   - **Implication**: Each `x[i]` vector is sorted, and if these vectors grow large due to high divisibility, the sorting operation becomes a bottleneck.

4. **Invariant 4: Large Maximum Element Leading to High Loop Bounds**:
   - **Natural Language Description**: "A large maximum element in the input array leads to high loop bounds for divisors, increasing the function's execution time quadratically."
   - **Implication**: The cost of operations grows with the square of the maximum element due to double loops iterating up to `mx`.

These invariants are broad enough to catch potential future slowdowns while still reflecting realistic triggers given the constraints of the problem. Specifically, they target scenarios where either the maximum number in the array or the structure of the numbers (in terms of divisors) leads to computationally expensive operations.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
You are given an integer array a_1, a_2, …, a_n.

The array b is called to be a subsequence of a if it is possible to remove some elements from a to get b.

Array b_1, b_2, …, b_k is called to be good if it is not empty and for every i (1 ≤ i ≤ k) b_i is divisible by i.

Find the number of good subsequences in a modulo 10^9 + 7. 

Two subsequences are considered different if index sets of numbers included in them are different. That is, the values ​of the elements ​do not matter in the comparison of subsequences. In particular, the array a has exactly 2^n - 1 different subsequences (excluding an empty subsequence).

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000) — the length of the array a.

The next line contains integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6).

Output

Print exactly one integer — the number of good subsequences taken modulo 10^9 + 7.

Note

In the first example, all three non-empty possible subsequences are good: \{1\}, \{1, 2\}, \{2\}

In the second example, the possible good subsequences are: \{2\}, \{2, 2\}, \{2, 22\}, \{2, 14\}, \{2\}, \{2, 22\}, \{2, 14\}, \{1\}, \{1, 22\}, \{1, 14\}, \{22\}, \{22, 14\}, \{14\}.

Note, that some subsequences are listed more than once, since they occur in the original array multiple times.

assistant: ## Phase 3: Implement Performance-Characterizing Invariants in C++

Let's implement the natural language invariants derived previously into C++ checks.

### Invariant 1: High Maximum Value in Array
```cpp
void check_max_value_invariant(int max_value) {
    if (max_value > 500000) { // Threshold chosen based on problem constraints and observations
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - maximum value in array is very large!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Invariant 2: High Number of Divisors
```cpp
void check_divisor_count_invariant(const vector<int>& x) {
    for (const auto& divisors : x) {
        if (divisors.size() > 200) { // Arbitrary threshold indicating a large number of divisors
            cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - number has many divisors!" << endl;
            abort();
        }
    }
}
```

### Invariant 3: Expensive Sorting Operations
```cpp
void check_sorting_invariant(const vector<int>& x) {
    for (const auto& divisors : x) {
        if (divisors.size() > 100) { // Threshold indicating large divisor collections need sorting
            cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - sorting large data!" << endl;
            abort();
        }
    }
}
```

### Invariant 4: Large Maximum Element Leading to High Loop Bounds
```cpp
void check_loop_bound_invariant(int max_value) {
    if (max_value > 750000) { // Conservative threshold for loop bounds based on mx
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large loop bounds!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

## Phase 4: Integrate Checks into the Program

Now, we integrate these checks into the provided C++ program.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

vector<int> x[1000005];
int a[100005];
long long f[1000005];

void check_max_value_invariant(int max_value) {
    if (max_value > 500000) { // Threshold chosen based on problem constraints and observations
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - maximum value in array is very large!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_divisor_count_invariant(const vector<int> x[], int mx) {
    for (int i = 1; i <= mx; ++i) {
        if (x[i].size() > 200) { // Arbitrary threshold indicating a large number of divisors
            cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - number has many divisors!" << endl;
            abort();
        }
    }
}

void check_sorting_invariant(const vector<int> x[], int mx) {
    for (int i = 1; i <= mx; ++i) {
        if (x[i].size() > 100) { // Threshold indicating large divisor collections need sorting
            cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - sorting large data!" << endl;
            abort();
        }
    }
}

void check_loop_bound_invariant(int max_value) {
    if (max_value > 750000) { // Conservative threshold for loop bounds based on mx
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large loop bounds!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    int n, i, mx = 0, j;
    long long ans = 0;

    scanf("%d", &n);
    for (i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        scanf("%d", &a[i]);
        mx = max(a[i], mx);
    }

### Notes:
- The checks are placed after processing the input and before the heavy computations to avoid adding overhead within tight loops.
- Each check corresponds to a performance-characterizing invariant identified earlier, focusing on potential bottlenecks due to large values or complex operations.
