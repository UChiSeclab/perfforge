system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

Vadim loves decorating the Christmas tree, so he got a beautiful garland as a present. It consists of n light bulbs in a single row. Each bulb has a number from 1 to n (in arbitrary order), such that all the numbers are distinct. While Vadim was solving problems, his home Carp removed some light bulbs from the garland. Now Vadim wants to put them back on.

<image>

Vadim wants to put all bulb back on the garland. Vadim defines complexity of a garland to be the number of pairs of adjacent bulbs with numbers with different parity (remainder of the division by 2). For example, the complexity of 1 4 2 3 5 is 2 and the complexity of 1 3 5 7 6 4 2 is 1.

No one likes complexity, so Vadim wants to minimize the number of such pairs. Find the way to put all bulbs back on the garland, such that the complexity is as small as possible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of light bulbs on the garland.

The second line contains n integers p_1,\ p_2,\ …,\ p_n (0 ≤ p_i ≤ n) — the number on the i-th bulb, or 0 if it was removed.

Output

Output a single number — the minimum complexity of the garland.

Examples

Input


5
0 5 0 2 3


Output


2


Input


7
1 0 0 5 0 0 2


Output


1

Note

In the first example, one should place light bulbs as 1 5 4 2 3. In that case, the complexity would be equal to 2, because only (5, 4) and (2, 3) are the pairs of adjacent bulbs that have different parity.

In the second case, one of the correct answers is 1 7 3 5 6 4 2.

assistant: Given the context and information provided, let's analyze the program to identify the performance bottlenecks and derive performance-characterizing invariants.

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Comparison of Hit Counts:**
   - The initialization loop for the `dp` array (lines 15-19) shows a significant difference in hit counts between slow and fast inputs. The `dp` initialization is hit approximately 10,201,000 times for the slow input versus very few times for the fast input.
   - The nested loops (lines 36-41) also indicate a high hit count for the slow input, with millions of hits, while the fast input doesn't even trigger these loops due to its minimal size.

2. **Pinpointing Problematic Code:**
   - The heavy initialization of the `dp` array and nested loops (lines 36-51) are the primary sources of inefficiency, especially given the high hit counts associated with them for the slow input.

3. **Interactions with Data Structures:**
   - The `dp` array is a multi-dimensional dynamic programming table, and the bulk of hits are in its initialization and update phases.
   - The slow performance is likely due to the number of potential states being considered: for each bulb position `i`, the algorithm considers transitions based on the number of odd/even numbers used (`x`, `y`) and parity (`val`).

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the analysis, here are some performance-characterizing invariants in natural language:

1. **Invariant on Bulb Configuration:**
   - "If the input sequence contains a large number of missing bulbs (represented by zeroes), the dynamic programming table becomes large, leading to a slowdown due to excessive state exploration."

2. **Invariant on State Space Complexity:**
   - "When the number of missing bulbs approaches the maximum limit and are clustered together, the number of potential arrangements to evaluate increases exponentially, causing longer execution times."

3. **Invariant on Initialization Overhead:**
   - "The performance is adversely affected when there is a need to initialize a large dynamic programming table due to high values of `n`, leading to significant overhead in the setup phase."

4. **Invariant on Loop Nestedness:**
   - "If loops nest deeply due to constraints on the number of used odd and even bulbs, the computation of the minimum complexity becomes expensive, and execution may slow down significantly."

These invariants suggest that the program becomes inefficient primarily when the input requires extensive use of the dynamic programming table with high dimensionality. This directly relates to situations where many bulbs are missing, resulting in significant state space to explore for optimal complexity reduction.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
Vadim loves decorating the Christmas tree, so he got a beautiful garland as a present. It consists of n light bulbs in a single row. Each bulb has a number from 1 to n (in arbitrary order), such that all the numbers are distinct. While Vadim was solving problems, his home Carp removed some light bulbs from the garland. Now Vadim wants to put them back on.

<image>

Vadim wants to put all bulb back on the garland. Vadim defines complexity of a garland to be the number of pairs of adjacent bulbs with numbers with different parity (remainder of the division by 2). For example, the complexity of 1 4 2 3 5 is 2 and the complexity of 1 3 5 7 6 4 2 is 1.

No one likes complexity, so Vadim wants to minimize the number of such pairs. Find the way to put all bulbs back on the garland, such that the complexity is as small as possible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of light bulbs on the garland.

The second line contains n integers p_1,\ p_2,\ …,\ p_n (0 ≤ p_i ≤ n) — the number on the i-th bulb, or 0 if it was removed.

Output

Output a single number — the minimum complexity of the garland.

Examples

Input


5
0 5 0 2 3


Output


2


Input


7
1 0 0 5 0 0 2


Output


1

Note

In the first example, one should place light bulbs as 1 5 4 2 3. In that case, the complexity would be equal to 2, because only (5, 4) and (2, 3) are the pairs of adjacent bulbs that have different parity.

In the second case, one of the correct answers is 1 7 3 5 6 4 2.

assistant: Let's proceed with Phase 3 to transform the performance-characterizing invariants into runtime checks in C++.

### Phase 3: Implementing Natural Language Invariants in C++

1. **Invariant on Bulb Configuration:**
   - If the input sequence contains a large number of missing bulbs (represented by zeroes), the dynamic programming table becomes large, leading to a slowdown due to excessive state exploration.

```cpp
void check_bulb_configuration_invariant(const std::vector<int>& bulbs) {
    int zeroCount = std::count(bulbs.begin(), bulbs.end(), 0);
    if (zeroCount > bulbs.size() / 2) { // Arbitrary threshold: more than half of bulbs missing
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to excessive missing bulbs!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

2. **Invariant on State Space Complexity:**
   - When the number of missing bulbs approaches the maximum limit and are clustered together, the number of potential arrangements to evaluate increases exponentially.

```cpp
void check_state_space_invariant(const std::vector<int>& bulbs) {
    int max_cluster = 0, current_cluster = 0;
    for (int bulb : bulbs) {
        if (bulb == 0) {
            current_cluster++;
        } else {
            max_cluster = std::max(max_cluster, current_cluster);
            current_cluster = 0;
        }
    }
    max_cluster = std::max(max_cluster, current_cluster);
    if (max_cluster > bulbs.size() / 2) { // Arbitrary threshold: more than half in a contiguous block
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to large cluster of missing bulbs!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

3. **Invariant on Initialization Overhead:**
   - The performance is adversely affected when there is a need to initialize a large dynamic programming table.

```cpp
void check_initialization_invariant(int n) {
    if (n > 50) { // Arbitrary threshold: significant overhead for large `n`
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to large DP table initialization!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

4. **Invariant on Loop Nestedness:**
   - If loops nest deeply due to constraints on the number of used odd and even bulbs, the computation of the minimum complexity becomes expensive.

```cpp
void check_loop_nesting_invariant(int n) {
    if (n > 50) { // Arbitrary threshold: Complexity increases with larger `n`
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to deep loop nesting!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrating Checks into the Original Program

Below is the instrumented C++ code incorporating the invariant checks:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Function to check invariant on bulb configuration
void check_bulb_configuration_invariant(const vector<int>& bulbs) {
    int zeroCount = count(bulbs.begin(), bulbs.end(), 0);
    if (zeroCount > bulbs.size() / 2) { // Threshold: more than half of bulbs missing
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to excessive missing bulbs!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Function to check invariant on state space complexity
void check_state_space_invariant(const vector<int>& bulbs) {
    int max_cluster = 0, current_cluster = 0;
    for (int bulb : bulbs) {
        if (bulb == 0) {
            current_cluster++;
        } else {
            max_cluster = max(max_cluster, current_cluster);
            current_cluster = 0;
        }
    }
    max_cluster = max(max_cluster, current_cluster);
    if (max_cluster > bulbs.size() / 2) { // Threshold: more than half in one block
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to large cluster of missing bulbs!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Function to check invariant on initialization overhead
void check_initialization_invariant(int n) {
    if (n > 50) { // Threshold for initialization overhead
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to large DP table initialization!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Function to check invariant on loop nesting
void check_loop_nesting_invariant(int n) {
    if (n > 50) { // Threshold for loop nesting
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to deep loop nesting!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void solve() {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    vector<int> a(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        cin >> a[i];
    }
    
    // Invariant checks before proceeding
    check_bulb_configuration_invariant(a);
    check_state_space_invariant(a);

                dp[i][x][y][1] = n * n;
            }

                } else {
                    dp[0][1][0][0] = 0;
                }
            }
        } else {
            for (int x = 0; x <= n; x++) {
                for (int y = 0; y <= n; y++) {
                    for (int val = 0; val < 2; val++) {
                        if (a[i] && val != a[i] % 2) {
                            continue;
                        }
                        if (!val) {
                            dp[i][x + 1][y][val] =
                                min(dp[i][x + 1][y][val], dp[i - 1][x][y][val]);
                            dp[i][x + 1][y][val] =
                                min(dp[i][x + 1][y][val], dp[i - 1][x][y][val ^ 1] + 1);
                        } else {
                            dp[i][x][y + 1][val] =
                                min(dp[i][x][y + 1][val], dp[i - 1][x][y][val]);
                            dp[i][x][y + 1][val] =
                                min(dp[i][x][y + 1][val], dp[i - 1][x][y][val ^ 1] + 1);
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
    vector<int> cnt(2);
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        cnt[i % 2]++;
    }
    cout << min(dp[n - 1][cnt[0]][cnt[1]][0], dp[n - 1][cnt[0]][cnt[1]][1])
         << "\n";
}

int main() {
    cin.tie(0);
    ios::sync_with_stdio(0);
    int test;
    test = 1;
    while (test--) {
        solve();
    }
    return 0;
}
```

The inserted checks serve as preventive measures to highlight potential performance bottlenecks during runtime based on the derived invariants. If these conditions are met, a message is logged, and the program is aborted to help identify and resolve the inefficiencies.
