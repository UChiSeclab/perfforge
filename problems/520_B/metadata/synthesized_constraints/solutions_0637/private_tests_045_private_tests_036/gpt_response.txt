### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

Upon examining the hit count data, the following lines experience significantly higher hit counts in the slow input compared to the fast input:

- **Lines 15 to 18:** The loop and condition checks are executed many more times in the slow input.
- **Lines 19 to 23:** The operations related to doubling the number (`ne.x = pos.x * 2`) and queuing it are hit frequently.
- **Lines 25 to 28:** Similar frequent hits occur for the decrement operation (`ne.x = pos.x - 1`) and its subsequent queuing.

The above lines suggest that the breadth-first search (BFS) loop runs many iterations for the slow input, processing numerous nodes before reaching the target number `m`. The problem arises because the BFS explores multiple paths, especially when starting with a large number and needing only a slight increase, such as converting 9999 to 10000.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **Invariant on Near-Target Starting Values:**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "If the starting number `n` is close to the target number `m` but less than `m`, the BFS may explore many paths when `n` is large, leading to a high number of operations."
   - **Explanation:** When `n` is very close to `m` but still smaller, the BFS starts by exploring a vast search space due to the doubling operation, since multiple paths can lead to overshooting the target before correction with subtraction.

2. **Invariant on Exploratory Operations:**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "When a large starting number `n` is very close to the target `m`, the BFS tends to make excessive exploratory operations due to the doubling operation, which overshoots the target."
   - **Explanation:** The doubling operation frequently exceeds `m`, and subsequent corrections via subtraction are necessary, causing a high number of redundant operations.

3. **Invariant on High Initial Numbers:**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "If the initial number `n` is significantly larger than half the maximum number (`maxn`), doubling and decrementing operations may lead to a large search space within the BFS, especially if `n` is near `m`."
   - **Explanation:** When `n` is large and close to `m`, the BFS initially performs many redundant operations due to its strategy of doubling first and then correcting, which is inefficient if `m` is only slightly larger than `n`.

### Conclusion

The slow execution occurs primarily because the BFS explores a large number of potential states when the starting number `n` is close to the target `m` but still less than `m`. This results in many redundant operations due to the doubling and decrementing strategy, particularly when `n` is large. The outlined invariants capture these conditions and can help in diagnosing similar slow scenarios in the future.

### Phase 3: Implement the Invariants as Runtime Checks

Here are the C++ code snippets that correspond to the natural language invariants described earlier:

1. **Invariant on Near-Target Starting Values:**
   ```cpp
   void check_near_target_starting_values(int n, int m) {
       if (n < m && abs(n - m) <= 10) { // Assuming "close" is within a small range like 10
           cerr << "Warning: Near-target starting value might cause excessive operations!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Invariant on Exploratory Operations:**
   ```cpp
   void check_exploratory_operations(int n, int m) {
       if (n < m && n > m / 2) {  // Large n, but less than m
           cerr << "Warning: Exploratory operations due to large starting number!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Invariant on High Initial Numbers:**
   ```cpp
   void check_high_initial_numbers(int n, int m) {
       if (n > 5000 && n < m && abs(n - m) < 100) { // Large n with a small difference
           cerr << "Warning: High initial number causing large search space!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Integrate the Checks into the Original Program

Below is the instrumented C++ code with the checks integrated at appropriate locations:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
const int maxn = 1e5 + 10;
using namespace std;

// Checker function to detect near-target starting values
void check_near_target_starting_values(int n, int m) {
    if (n < m && abs(n - m) <= 10) { // Assuming "close" is within a small range like 10
        cerr << "Warning: Near-target starting value might cause excessive operations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Checker function for exploratory operations
void check_exploratory_operations(int n, int m) {
    if (n < m && n > m / 2) {  // Large n, but less than m
        cerr << "Warning: Exploratory operations due to large starting number!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Checker function for high initial numbers
void check_high_initial_numbers(int n, int m) {
    if (n > 5000 && n < m && abs(n - m) < 100) { // Large n with a small difference
        cerr << "Warning: High initial number causing large search space!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

struct node {
  int x, num;
} ne, pos;

int bfs() {
  queue<node> q;
  map<int, int> mp;
  mp[n] = 1;
  ne.x = n;
  ne.num = 0;
  q.push(ne);
  while (!q.empty()) {
    pos = q.front();
    q.pop();
    if (pos.x == m) return pos.num;
    ne.num = pos.num + 1;
    ne.x = pos.x * 2;
    if (ne.x <= maxn && mp[ne.x] == 0) {
      mp[ne.x] = 1;
      q.push(ne);
    }
    ne.x = pos.x - 1;
    if (ne.x >= 0 && mp[ne.x] == 0) {
      mp[ne.x] = 1;
      q.push(ne);
    }
  }
  return 0;
}

int main() {
  int ans;
  while (~scanf("%d%d", &n, &m)) {

    // Insert checks before performing the BFS
    check_near_target_starting_values(n, m);
    check_exploratory_operations(n, m);
    check_high_initial_numbers(n, m);

    ans = bfs();
    cout << ans << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

### Explanation
- **Check Placement:** The checks are placed right after reading inputs `n` and `m`, before the BFS function is called. This ensures we do not add unnecessary overhead within the BFS loop itself.
- **Thresholds:** The thresholds for what constitutes a "near-target" or "large initial number" are set based on logical assumptions about what could lead to inefficiencies, rather than specific values from the input data.
- **Warnings and Abort:** Each check outputs a warning message and aborts execution if the condition is met, allowing for quick identification of performance bottlenecks during testing or fuzzing.
