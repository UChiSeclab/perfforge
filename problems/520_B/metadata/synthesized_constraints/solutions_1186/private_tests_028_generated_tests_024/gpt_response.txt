### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Comparison of Line-level Hit Counts:**
   - The `dfs` function is called 37,056,380 times for the slow input, but only once for the fast input. This indicates a massive difference in execution paths.
   - Within the `dfs` function, line 13 (`dfs(now * 2, d + 1)`) and line 14 (`dfs(now - 1, d + 1)`) are called heavily in the slow input, suggesting deep recursion and numerous recursive calls.

2. **Analysis of Expensive Operations:**
   - The function checks if `now >= y` (line 9) and performs updates on the `dis` array (lines 8 and 10), which are also heavily hit, indicating that these operations are critical in the computation path.
   - The recursion in `dfs(now * 2, d + 1)` suggests the exploration of a large search space when `now` needs to be doubled multiple times to reach close to `y`.

3. **Interaction with Data Structures:**
   - The `dis` array acts as a visited state cache to avoid repeated calculations. However, despite this, the function must explore many states due to the nature of the problem, especially for the slow input where `n` (2) needs to reach `m` (10,000).

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **High Recursion Depth and Branching Factor:**
   - **Invariant:** "If the initial value `n` is considerably smaller than `m`, the recursion depth becomes significant as the program attempts to reach `m` through doubling operations. This results in many recursive calls and heavy branching, leading to slow performance."
   - **Explanation:** When `n` is much smaller than `m`, the doubling operation (`now * 2`) is heavily utilized, leading to a large number of states to explore, increasing both depth and breadth of recursion.

2. **Frequent Updating of State Array:**
   - **Invariant:** "Frequent updates to the state array `dis` occur when the search space is large, particularly when `n` is initially much smaller than `m`. This contributes to slowdown as numerous states are revisited and recalculated."
   - **Explanation:** The array `dis` is updated repeatedly in deep recursive calls, especially when trying to reach a much larger `m`. The program tries multiple paths, updating `dis` each time, which is computationally expensive.

3. **Excessive Recursive Search Path:**
   - **Invariant:** "When the target number `m` is significantly larger than the starting number `n`, the program engages in an exhaustive recursive search, resulting in a high number of operations and slower execution."
   - **Explanation:** The need to explore multiple doubling paths to reach a large `m` from a small `n`, without a clear heuristic to prune paths, leads to excessive branching and recursive depth.

These invariants capture the conditions under which the code is likely to slow down, focusing on cases where `n` is much smaller than `m`, requiring extensive exploration of possible paths to reach the target number. The recursive nature and lack of efficient pruning result in high computational overhead.

### Phase 3: Implement the Natural Language Invariants in C++

Below are the C++ code snippets that implement the performance-characterizing invariants derived in Phase 2:

1. **High Recursion Depth and Branching Factor:**

```cpp
void check_recursion_depth_and_branching(int n, int m, int currentDepth) {
    // This condition checks if the current state of the recursion is likely deep or has high branching.
    if (n < m && currentDepth > 50) {  // Assuming a depth threshold of 50 for large search spaces
        cerr << "Warning: High recursion depth and branching factor detected!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

2. **Frequent Updating of State Array:**

```cpp
void check_state_array_updates(int n, int m, int* dis, int currentNumber) {
    // This condition checks if we are updating the state array too frequently due to a wide search space.
    if (n < m && dis[currentNumber] != 0x3f3f3f3f) { // Check if we're revisiting a non-initialized state
        cerr << "Warning: Frequent state array updates detected!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

3. **Excessive Recursive Search Path:**

```cpp
void check_excessive_recursive_search(int n, int m, int currentNumber) {
    // Check if the excessive search path is happening when n is much smaller than m and current number is still far from m
    if (n < m && currentNumber < m / 2) { // Use a heuristic that currentNumber is far from m
        cerr << "Warning: Excessive recursive search path detected!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrate the Checker Code with the Original Program

Now, let's integrate these checks into the original C++ program. We'll strategically place these checks to avoid performance degradation and ensure meaningful detection of potential bottlenecks.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
const int N = 2e6 + 10;
int x, y;
int dis[N];

// Check for high recursion depth and branching factor
void check_recursion_depth_and_branching(int n, int m, int currentDepth) {
    if (n < m && currentDepth > 50) {
        cerr << "Warning: High recursion depth and branching factor detected!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Check for frequent updates to the state array
void check_state_array_updates(int n, int m, int* dis, int currentNumber) {
    if (n < m && dis[currentNumber] != 0x3f3f3f3f) {
        cerr << "Warning: Frequent state array updates detected!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Check for excessive recursive search path
void check_excessive_recursive_search(int n, int m, int currentNumber) {
    if (n < m && currentNumber < m / 2) {
        cerr << "Warning: Excessive recursive search path detected!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void dfs(int now, int d) {
    check_recursion_depth_and_branching(x, y, d); // Insert check for recursion depth
    check_excessive_recursive_search(x, y, now);  // Insert check for search path

    if (dis[now] <= d) return;
    dis[now] = d;
    check_state_array_updates(x, y, dis, now); // Insert check for state array updates

    if (now >= y) {
        dis[y] = min(dis[y], d + now - y);
        return;
    }

    dfs(now * 2, d + 1);
    if (now > 1) dfs(now - 1, d + 1);
}

int main() {
    cin >> x >> y;
    memset(dis, 0x3f3f3f3f, sizeof(dis));
    dfs(x, 0);
    cout << dis[y] << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

- **High Recursion Depth and Branching Factor:** This check is inserted at the start of the recursive `dfs` function to abort if the depth exceeds a reasonable threshold.
  
- **Frequent State Array Updates:** This check is applied after setting the `dis` array to catch frequent updates due to revisiting states.

- **Excessive Recursive Search Path:** This check is also at the start of the `dfs` function to detect when the recursive path is excessively long due to the nature of the problem inputs.

These checks help identify potential performance bottlenecks dynamically as the program runs, allowing for better insight during testing and debugging.
