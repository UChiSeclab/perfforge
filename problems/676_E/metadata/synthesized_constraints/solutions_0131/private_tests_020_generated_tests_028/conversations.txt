system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

100 years have passed since the last victory of the man versus computer in Go. Technologies made a huge step forward and robots conquered the Earth! It's time for the final fight between human and robot that will decide the faith of the planet.

The following game was chosen for the fights: initially there is a polynomial 

P(x) = anxn + an - 1xn - 1 + ... + a1x + a0,  with yet undefined coefficients and the integer k. Players alternate their turns. At each turn, a player pick some index j, such that coefficient aj that stay near xj is not determined yet and sets it to any value (integer or real, positive or negative, 0 is also allowed). Computer moves first. The human will be declared the winner if and only if the resulting polynomial will be divisible by Q(x) = x - k.

Polynomial P(x) is said to be divisible by polynomial Q(x) if there exists a representation P(x) = B(x)Q(x), where B(x) is also some polynomial.

Some moves have been made already and now you wonder, is it true that human can guarantee the victory if he plays optimally?

Input

The first line of the input contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000, |k| ≤ 10 000) — the size of the polynomial and the integer k.

The i-th of the following n + 1 lines contain character '?' if the coefficient near xi - 1 is yet undefined or the integer value ai, if the coefficient is already known ( - 10 000 ≤ ai ≤ 10 000). Each of integers ai (and even an) may be equal to 0.

Please note, that it's not guaranteed that you are given the position of the game where it's computer's turn to move.

Output

Print "Yes" (without quotes) if the human has winning strategy, or "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

Note

In the first sample, computer set a0 to  - 1 on the first move, so if human can set coefficient a1 to 0.5 and win.

In the second sample, all coefficients are already set and the resulting polynomial is divisible by x - 100, so the human has won.

assistant: ### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Slow Input Analysis**:
   - Loop at line 11: For the slow input, it's executed 102 times, indicating each coefficient of the polynomial is processed.
   - The `stringstream` operations (lines 17-21) are executed 101 times, converting inputs to integer values.
   - The calculations in lines 53-59 for division and addition are executed for each coefficient in the polynomial. 

2. **Fast Input Analysis**:
   - For the fast input, the loop at line 11 is executed only 3 times.
   - The `stringstream` operations (lines 17-21) are executed only twice.

3. **Key Difference**:
   - The slow input processes significantly more coefficients due to the larger polynomial size (`n = 100` vs. `n = 1`).
   - The division and modular operations in lines 53-61 contribute more to processing time due to increased coefficients.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **Invariant 1**: High Polynomial Degree 
   - **Natural Language**: "When the polynomial degree `n` is large, particularly close to the maximum constraint, the computation becomes extensive as each coefficient and its operations are processed in sequence, contributing to a slowdown."
   - **Explanation**: Larger `n` results in more iterations through loops and more operations, increasing processing time. 

2. **Invariant 2**: Sequential Processing of Non-Zero Coefficients
   - **Natural Language**: "If the polynomial has many non-zero coefficients, the necessity to process each non-zero element through division and accumulation results in slower performance."
   - **Explanation**: Non-zero coefficients require additional arithmetic operations, which are compounded in loops for each polynomial term. 

3. **Invariant 3**: High Absolute Value of `k` 
   - **Natural Language**: "The absolute value of `k` being large can exacerbate division operations, leading to more computation per coefficient."
   - **Explanation**: Larger values of `k` increase the complexity of the operations in lines 52-61, using more computational resources and slowing down execution.

4. **Invariant 4**: Extensive Use of `stringstream` 
   - **Natural Language**: "Frequent use of `stringstream` for converting large numbers of coefficients from string to integer can slow the program, especially as the input size increases."
   - **Explanation**: The overhead of repeatedly using `stringstream` in a loop for each input line adds up, particularly impacting performance for larger polynomials.

These performance-characterizing invariants identify conditions where the program may enter a slow path, focusing on operations and data sizes that lead to inefficiencies. By understanding these, we can predict and potentially mitigate slowdowns under similar future scenarios.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
100 years have passed since the last victory of the man versus computer in Go. Technologies made a huge step forward and robots conquered the Earth! It's time for the final fight between human and robot that will decide the faith of the planet.

The following game was chosen for the fights: initially there is a polynomial 

P(x) = anxn + an - 1xn - 1 + ... + a1x + a0,  with yet undefined coefficients and the integer k. Players alternate their turns. At each turn, a player pick some index j, such that coefficient aj that stay near xj is not determined yet and sets it to any value (integer or real, positive or negative, 0 is also allowed). Computer moves first. The human will be declared the winner if and only if the resulting polynomial will be divisible by Q(x) = x - k.

Polynomial P(x) is said to be divisible by polynomial Q(x) if there exists a representation P(x) = B(x)Q(x), where B(x) is also some polynomial.

Some moves have been made already and now you wonder, is it true that human can guarantee the victory if he plays optimally?

Input

The first line of the input contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000, |k| ≤ 10 000) — the size of the polynomial and the integer k.

The i-th of the following n + 1 lines contain character '?' if the coefficient near xi - 1 is yet undefined or the integer value ai, if the coefficient is already known ( - 10 000 ≤ ai ≤ 10 000). Each of integers ai (and even an) may be equal to 0.

Please note, that it's not guaranteed that you are given the position of the game where it's computer's turn to move.

Output

Print "Yes" (without quotes) if the human has winning strategy, or "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

Examples

Input

1 2
-1
?


Output

Yes


Input

2 100
-10000
0
1


Output

Yes

Input

4 5
?

1
?


Output

No

Note

In the first sample, computer set a0 to  - 1 on the first move, so if human can set coefficient a1 to 0.5 and win.

In the second sample, all coefficients are already set and the resulting polynomial is divisible by x - 100, so the human has won.

assistant: ### Phase 3: Implement Natural Language Invariants in C++

Let's translate each invariant derived in Phase 2 into C++ code checkers:

1. **Invariant 1**: High Polynomial Degree
   ```cpp
   void check_degree_invariant(int n) {
       if (n >= 100000) {
           cerr << "Warning: High polynomial degree may lead to performance issues!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Invariant 2**: Sequential Processing of Non-Zero Coefficients
   ```cpp
   void check_non_zero_coefficients(int m) {
       if (m > 90000) {
           cerr << "Warning: Many non-zero coefficients may slow down the computation!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Invariant 3**: High Absolute Value of `k`
   ```cpp
   void check_k_value(int k) {
       if (abs(k) > 9000) {
           cerr << "Warning: High |k| value can increase computation complexity!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

4. **Invariant 4**: Extensive Use of `stringstream`
   ```cpp
   void check_stringstream_usage(int n) {
       if (n > 90000) {
           cerr << "Warning: Excessive `stringstream` usage may degrade performance!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Integrate Checker Code into the Original Program

Now, integrate the checker functions into the main program at effective points to avoid unnecessary overhead in tight loops:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
const int MAXN = 100005;
const int INF = 1000000000;
long long v[MAXN];

void check_degree_invariant(int n) {
    if (n >= 100000) {
        cerr << "Warning: High polynomial degree may lead to performance issues!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_non_zero_coefficients(int m) {
    if (m > 90000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Many non-zero coefficients may slow down the computation!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_k_value(int k) {
    if (abs(k) > 9000) {
        cerr << "Warning: High |k| value can increase computation complexity!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_stringstream_usage(int n) {
    if (n > 90000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Excessive `stringstream` usage may degrade performance!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    int n, k, m = 0;
    cin >> n >> k;

    // Checkers inserted appropriately
    check_degree_invariant(n);
    check_k_value(k);
    check_stringstream_usage(n);

    vector<int> pos;
    memset(v, 0, sizeof v);
    for (int i = 0; i < n + 1; i++) {
        string s;
        cin >> s;
        if (s.compare("?") == 0) {
            pos.push_back(i);
        } else {
            stringstream ss;
            ss << s;
            ss >> v[i];
            if ((i & 1) && (k < 0)) v[i] *= -1;
            if (v[i] != 0) m = i + 1;
        }
    }

    // Additional check for non-zero coefficients
    check_non_zero_coefficients(m);

    if ((int)pos.size() > 0) {
        if (k == 0) {
            if (pos[0] == 0) {
                if ((n + 1 - (int)pos.size()) & 1) {
                    cout << "Yes" << endl;
                } else {
                    cout << "No" << endl;
                }
            } else {
                if (v[0] == 0) {
                    cout << "Yes" << endl;
                } else {
                    cout << "No" << endl;
                }
            }
        } else {
            if ((n + 1) & 1) {
                cout << "No" << endl;
            } else {
                cout << "Yes" << endl;
            }
        }
    } else {
        long long acc = 0;
        bool ok = true;
        if (k == 0) {
            if (v[0] != 0) ok = false;
        } else {
            k = abs(k);
            for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
                if (acc % k) {
                    ok = false;
                    break;
                }
                acc /= k;
                acc += v[i];
            }
            if (acc != 0) ok = false;
        }
        if (ok) {
            cout << "Yes" << endl;
        } else {
            cout << "No" << endl;
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation
- **Degree Check**: Placed right after reading `n` to ensure high-degree computations are flagged early.
- **Non-Zero Coefficient Check**: Placed after processing coefficients to ensure only actual non-zero entries are counted.
- **`k` Value Check**: Directly after reading `k` to capture potential complexity issues from large divisors.
- **`stringstream` Usage Check**: Early in the input loop to prevent excessive allocations, influencing performance.

This code now integrates runtime checks to help detect conditions under which the program could potentially experience performance bottlenecks.
