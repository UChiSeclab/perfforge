=== Invariants Response ===
To analyze the performance bottlenecks in the given C++ program, let's proceed with the two phases outlined in the task.

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Comparison of Line-Level Hit Counts**:
   - The primary difference in execution frequency between the fast and slow inputs is within the loop (lines 24-35). The slow input hits lines 24, 25, and 26 significantly more than the fast input due to the increased size `n = 100` compared to `n = 1` in the fast input.
   - Line 31 and line 32 (stringstream operations) are also hit significantly more for the slow input due to processing multiple non-'?' entries.

2. **Pinpointing Significant Lines**:
   - **Line 24 (`for` loop):** This loop processes each coefficient of the polynomial, and its iteration count is directly tied to `n + 1`. For `n = 100`, this loop executes 101 times, whereas for the fast input, it executes 2 times.
   - **Line 31-33 (stringstream operations):** These lines are expensive when processing a large number of integer coefficients due to the overhead of converting strings to integers.

3. **Interaction with Data Structures**:
   - The `vector<int> a(n + 1)` implies storage and iteration over polynomial coefficients, with additional operations if coefficients are initially unknown (`'?'`).

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the analysis, the following performance-characterizing invariants can be derived:

1. **Invariant on Input Size and Initial Coefficients**:
   - **Natural Language Statement:** "When the polynomial's degree `n` is large, especially with no unknown coefficients to be optimized ('?'), the program may slow down significantly due to repeated string-to-integer conversions and modular arithmetic checks."
   - **Explanation:** As `n` increases, the computational overhead for reading and processing coefficients rises sharply. The lack of `'?'` reduces optimization opportunities, making the solution less efficient.

2. **Invariant on Stringstream Overhead**:
   - **Natural Language Statement:** "If the polynomial has many pre-defined coefficients (as opposed to unknown ones), performance may degrade due to the overhead of string-to-integer parsing."
   - **Explanation:** Each coefficient input that is not `'?'` incurs a string parsing cost, which accumulates as the polynomial degree increases, leading to slow execution.

3. **Invariant on Modulo Operations**:
   - **Natural Language Statement:** "When processing a large polynomial with integer division and modulo operations, performance may degrade if the modulus or divisor is large or if the sequence of coefficients leads to frequent non-zero remainders."
   - **Explanation:** The function `isDiv()` performs repeated modulo and division operations, which are computationally expensive as the polynomial size and complexity of coefficients increase.

These invariants help identify scenarios causing slowdowns and are broad enough to cover potential future inputs that fit the described characteristics. They focus on input size, number of pre-defined coefficients, and arithmetic operations, adhering to the constraints such as `n <= 100,000`.

=== Checker Response ===
Let's implement the performance-characterizing invariants as runtime checks in C++.

### Phase 3: Implementing Invariants in C++

Here are C++ code snippets for the invariants:

1. **Invariant on Input Size and Initial Coefficients**:
   ```cpp
   void check_large_degree_no_unknowns(bool condition) {
       if (condition) {
           cerr << "Warning: Large polynomial degree with no unknown coefficients may cause performance issues!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Invariant on Stringstream Overhead**:
   ```cpp
   void check_stream_conversion_overhead(bool condition) {
       if (condition) {
           cerr << "Warning: Excessive stringstream operations due to pre-defined coefficients!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Invariant on Modulo Operations**:
   ```cpp
   void check_modulo_operations(bool condition) {
       if (condition) {
           cerr << "Warning: Heavy use of modulo operations with large k or complex coefficient sequences!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Integrating Checks into the Original Program

Below is the original C++ program with the invariant checks integrated at appropriate points:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
const int c = -100005;
int var = 0;

bool isDiv(vector<int>& v, int k) {
    bool pos = true;
    int temp = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < v.size(); i++) {
        temp += v[i];
        if (temp % k != 0) {
            pos = false;
            break;
        } else {
            temp /= k;
        }
    }
    if (temp != 0) pos = false;
    return pos;
}

// Checker functions for performance-characterizing invariants
void check_large_degree_no_unknowns(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Large polynomial degree with no unknown coefficients may cause performance issues!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_stream_conversion_overhead(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Excessive stringstream operations due to pre-defined coefficients!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_modulo_operations(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Heavy use of modulo operations with large k or complex coefficient sequences!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    int n, k;
    cin >> n >> k;
    vector<int> a(n + 1);
    int predefined_count = 0;  // Count of pre-defined coefficients

    for (int i = 0; i < n + 1; i++) {
        string s;
        cin >> s;
        if (s == "?") {
            a[i] = c;
            var++;
        } else {
            stringstream myStream;
            myStream.str(s);
            myStream >> a[i];
            predefined_count++;  // Increment for each pre-defined coefficient
        }
    }

    // Check for large polynomial degree with no unknowns
    check_large_degree_no_unknowns(n > 10000 && var == 0);

    // Check for excessive stringstream operations
    check_stream_conversion_overhead(predefined_count > 5000);

    // Check for heavy modulo operations
    check_modulo_operations(k > 5000 && predefined_count > 5000);

    if (var == 0) {
        if (k == 0) {
            if (a[0] == 0)
                cout << "Yes" << endl;
            else
                cout << "No" << endl;
        } else {
            if (isDiv(a, k))
                cout << "Yes" << endl;
            else
                cout << "No" << endl;
        }
    } else {
        if (k == 0) {
            if (a[0] != 0 && a[0] != c)
                cout << "No" << endl;
            else if (a[0] == 0)
                cout << "Yes" << endl;
            else {
                if ((n + 1 - var) % 2 == 0)
                    cout << "No" << endl;
                else
                    cout << "Yes" << endl;
            }
        } else {
            if ((n + 1) % 2 == 0)
                cout << "Yes" << endl;
            else
                cout << "No" << endl;
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation

- **Large Polynomial Degree with No Unknowns:** This check is placed after reading inputs to detect when the polynomial degree is large and no coefficients are unknown, which can lead to computational inefficiencies.
  
- **Excessive Stringstream Operations:** This check counts the number of pre-defined coefficients and triggers if their count is significantly high, suggesting potential overhead from too many string-to-integer conversions.

- **Heavy Modulo Operations:** This check evaluates after input, using the size of `k` and number of coefficients to detect potential performance bottlenecks due to complex arithmetic operations.

These checks are implemented as functions for modularity and inserted strategically to minimize additional overhead.
