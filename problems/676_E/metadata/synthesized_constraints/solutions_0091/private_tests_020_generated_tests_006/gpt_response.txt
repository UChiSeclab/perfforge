=== Invariants Response ===
To analyze the performance bottlenecks in the given C program and derive performance-characterizing invariants, we can follow these phases:

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Hit Count Analysis:**
   - The `poli` function is called significantly more times in the slow input compared to the fast input. The slow input triggers 207 calls to `poli`, hitting lines inside this function (lines 12-15) over 20,000 times, while the fast input does not trigger this function.
   - The loop inside `poli` iterates `n` times (lines 12-15), contributing to the high hit count when `poli` is called multiple times.

2. **Data Structure and Loop Interactions:**
   - The function `poli` evaluates a polynomial modulo a given value, and it does so by iterating through the coefficients of the polynomial.
   - The slow input causes multiple evaluations of this polynomial for different moduli, as seen in the calls with varying `mod` values in lines 58-61.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on this analysis, we can articulate the conditions under which the program is likely to enter a slow path, focusing on how the slow input interacts with the code:

1. **Polynomial Evaluations:**
   - **Invariant:** "When the polynomial evaluation function `poli` is invoked repeatedly with different moduli for a polynomial with numerous coefficients, the computation time increases significantly, especially when `n` is large."
   - This invariant captures the repeated computation triggered by the polynomial evaluations over multiple moduli values.

2. **Size of n:**
   - **Invariant:** "If the polynomial degree `n` is close to the upper limit of the constraint (e.g., `n` is near 100,000), and many coefficients are fixed, the repeated modulo evaluations may lead to performance slowdowns."
   - This reflects how high values of `n` and the presence of defined coefficients can increase the number of operations.

3. **Loop Execution:**
   - **Invariant:** "When the number of undefined coefficients is low, but the degree `n` is large, the loop inside `poli` runs numerous times for each call, leading to substantial computation, especially when each iteration involves non-trivial arithmetic operations."
   - This is due to fewer undefined coefficients prompting exhaustive polynomial evaluations to determine divisibility.

These invariants highlight potential scenarios causing slow performance based on the program's logic and the structure of the input, providing a guide for understanding slow execution paths.

### Phase 3: Implementing the Natural Language Invariants as C++ Checkers

Below are the C++ code snippets that implement the performance-characterizing invariants derived earlier:

1. **Invariant for Polynomial Evaluations:**
   - **Condition:** If `poli` is called repeatedly with different moduli for a polynomial with numerous coefficients.
   
   ```cpp
   void check_polynomial_evaluation_invariant(int callCount, int degree) {
       if (callCount > 200 && degree > 50000) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive polynomial evaluations!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Invariant for Size of n:**
   - **Condition:** If the polynomial degree `n` is large and many coefficients are predetermined.
   
   ```cpp
   void check_large_degree_invariant(int degree, int definedCount) {
       if (degree > 90000 && definedCount > degree / 2) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large polynomial degree with many defined coefficients!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Invariant for Loop Execution:**
   - **Condition:** If the loop inside `poli` runs repeatedly with non-trivial arithmetic operations.
   
   ```cpp
   void check_loop_execution_invariant(int loopIterations, int calls) {
       if (loopIterations * calls > 100000 && loopIterations > 1000) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive loop iterations in `poli` function!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Integrating the Checkers into the Original Program

Here's the full C++ program with integrated checker functions:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
const int INF = 2e9 + 7;
const long long INFLL = 1e16 + 7;
const double EPS = 1e-6;
using namespace std;
const int maxn = 1e5 + 5;
int n, m;
int a[maxn];

void check_polynomial_evaluation_invariant(int callCount, int degree) {
    if (callCount > 200 && degree > 50000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive polynomial evaluations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_large_degree_invariant(int degree, int definedCount) {
    if (degree > 90000 && definedCount > degree / 2) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large polynomial degree with many defined coefficients!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_loop_execution_invariant(int loopIterations, int calls) {
    if (loopIterations * calls > 100000 && loopIterations > 1000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive loop iterations in `poli` function!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int poli(long long mod, int &callCount) {
    long long now = 1;
    long long ret = 0;
    int loopIterations = 0; // Track iterations for loop execution invariant
    for (int k = 0; k < n; k++) {
        ret += now * a[k];
        ret %= mod;
        now = (now * m) % mod;
        loopIterations++;
    }
    callCount++;
    check_loop_execution_invariant(loopIterations, callCount);
    if (ret) return 1;
    return 0;
}

int main() {
    scanf("%d%d", &n, &m);
    n++;
    int last = -1, sum = 0;
    int definedCount = 0; // Track number of defined coefficients
    for (int k = 0; k < n; k++) {
        char tmp[100];
        scanf("%s", &tmp);
        if (tmp[0] == '?') {
            last = k & 1;
            a[k] = INF;
            sum++;
        } else {
            sscanf(tmp, "%d", &a[k]);
            definedCount++;
        }
    }

    check_large_degree_invariant(n, definedCount);

    if (m == 0) {
        if (a[0] != INF) {
            if (a[0] == 0)
                printf("Yes\n");
            else
                printf("No\n");
        } else {
            if ((n - sum) % 2)
                printf("Yes\n");
            else
                printf("No\n");
        }
        return 0;
    }

    if (last != -1) {
        if (n % 2 == 0)
            printf("Yes\n");
        else
            printf("No\n");
        return 0;
    }

    int cek = 0;
    long long ten[25];
    ten[0] = 1;
    for (int k = 1; k < 18; k++) ten[k] = ten[k - 1] * 10;

    int callCount = 0; // Initialize call count for polynomial evaluation invariant
    for (int k = 3; k < 9; k++) cek = (cek | poli(ten[k] + 7, callCount));
    cek = (cek | poli(ten[9], callCount));
    for (int k = INF; k < INF + 200; k++) cek = (cek | poli(k, callCount));

    check_polynomial_evaluation_invariant(callCount, n);

    if (cek == 0)
        printf("Yes\n");
    else
        printf("No\n");
    return 0;
}
```

**Comments:**
- Each check is placed after the relevant computation to monitor conditions that may lead to performance issues.
- The check functions use thresholds that are reasonable and aligned with the constraints of the problem (e.g., `n <= 100,000`).
