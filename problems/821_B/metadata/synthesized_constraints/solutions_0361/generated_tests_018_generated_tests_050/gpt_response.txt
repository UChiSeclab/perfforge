### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Hit Count Analysis**:
   - The line with the loop `for (long long i = 0; i <= c; i++) {` (Line 8) was hit 8,589,858 times for the slow input versus 89,058 times for the fast input. This indicates a significant difference in the number of iterations.
   - The lines inside the loop (Lines 9-11) were also executed a similar number of times as the loop, suggesting the loop is responsible for the slowdown.

2. **Loop Characteristics**:
   - The loop runs from `0` to `c` where `c = b * m`. With `b = 8096` for both inputs and `m = 1061` for the slow input, `c` becomes significantly larger (8,588,656), leading to the loop executing many more times than when `m = 11` for the fast input (`c = 89,056`).

3. **Interaction with Variables**:
   - The loop's iteration count is directly proportional to `m * b`, meaning that for larger values of `m`, the loop will iterate many more times, compounded by the range of `b`.
   - The operations inside the loop involve arithmetic calculations which scale linearly with both `i` and `y`, calculated as `b - ceil(i * 1.0 / m)`.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **Invariant 1: High Linear Complexity with Respect to `m` and `b`**:
   - **Natural Language Description**: "The program experiences a slowdown when the product of `m` and `b` becomes very large, as this determines the linear complexity of the loop iterating over `m * b` times."
   - **Reasoning**: With larger `m` values, the computation inside a loop that executes `m * b` times becomes too costly, especially when `b` is already large.

2. **Invariant 2: Sensitivity to High `m` Values**:
   - **Natural Language Description**: "If `m` approaches its upper constraint while `b` is significant, the iteration count grows dramatically, causing performance degradation."
   - **Reasoning**: High values of `m` increase the number of iterations, potentially causing excessive computational overhead due to repeated arithmetic operations.

3. **Invariant 3: Cumulative Arithmetic Overhead**:
   - **Natural Language Description**: "A notable slowdown occurs when the cumulative arithmetic operations within the loop — calculating `y` and `cur` — are repeated over a large range set by `m * b`."
   - **Reasoning**: The use of arithmetic expressions involving quadratic terms executed many times intensifies performance issues, particularly with large iteration ranges.

### Conclusion

These performance-characterizing invariants highlight how the loop's iteration count, driven by the product of `m` and `b`, dominates the program's runtime. By understanding these conditions, developers can focus on optimizing the loop or algorithm logic to mitigate the slowdowns when `m` and `b` are both large within their respective constraints.

### Phase 3: Implement the Natural Language Invariants in C++

Below are the C++ code snippets to check each of the derived performance-characterizing invariants:

1. **Invariant for High Linear Complexity with Respect to `m` and `b`**:
   - This invariant checks if the product of `m` and `b` becomes too large, implying that the loop will execute a high number of times.

```cpp
void check_loop_iteration_invariant(long long m, long long b) {
    if (m * b > 1000000) { // Threshold chosen to capture excessive loop counts
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - loop iteration count too high!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

2. **Invariant for Sensitivity to High `m` Values**:
   - This invariant examines if `m` approaches its upper constraint with a significant `b`.

```cpp
void check_m_value_invariant(long long m, long long b) {
    if (m > 950 && b > 8000) { // Thresholds chosen based on high values towards constraints
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high m value causes excessive iterations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

3. **Invariant for Cumulative Arithmetic Overhead**:
   - This invariant will monitor the potential overhead from repeated arithmetic operations within the loop.

```cpp
void check_arithmetic_overhead_invariant(long long m, long long b) {
    if (m * b > 500000) { // Threshold chosen to limit arithmetic overhead
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high arithmetic overhead in loop!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrate the Checkers into the Original C++ Program

Here is the instrumented version of the original program with the appropriate checks integrated:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Function to check loop iteration count
void check_loop_iteration_invariant(long long m, long long b) {
    if (m * b > 1000000) { // Threshold chosen to capture excessive loop counts
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - loop iteration count too high!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Function to check high m value
void check_m_value_invariant(long long m, long long b) {
    if (m > 950 && b > 8000) { // Thresholds chosen based on high values towards constraints
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high m value causes excessive iterations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Function to check arithmetic overhead
void check_arithmetic_overhead_invariant(long long m, long long b) {
    if (m * b > 500000) { // Threshold chosen to limit arithmetic overhead
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high arithmetic overhead in loop!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    long long m, b;
    cin >> m >> b;

    // Check invariants before entering the loop
    check_loop_iteration_invariant(m, b);
    check_m_value_invariant(m, b);
    check_arithmetic_overhead_invariant(m, b);

    long long c = b * m;
    long long ans = 0;
    for (long long i = 0; i <= c; i++) {
        long long y = b - ceil(i * 1.0 / m);
        long long cur = i * (i + 1) / 2 * (y + 1) + y * (y + 1) / 2 * (i + 1);
        ans = max(ans, cur);
    }
    cout << ans << endl;
}
```

### Explanation:

- Each checker function is placed before the loop begins in `main()`, ensuring they do not add overhead to the loop itself.
- These checks are designed to provide early warnings when `m` and `b` values might lead to significant performance degradation based on the observed bottlenecks.
- The chosen thresholds aim to balance between avoiding premature aborts and effectively catching conditions that lead to excessive computation.
