### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Comparison of Hit Counts**:
   - The `for` loop on line 7 has a `slow_hit_count` of 8,589,858 versus a `fast_hit_count` of 89,058. This indicates that the loop is executed a significantly larger number of times in the slow input.
   - Lines 8, 9, and 10 are heavily hit during both runs but show a proportional increase consistent with line 7, suggesting that these computations are repeated for every iteration of the loop.

2. **Analysis of Loop and Data Interactions**:
   - The loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i = m * b`. For the slow input, `m = 1061` and `b = 8096`, resulting in `m * b = 8,589,856` iterations.
   - The lines inside the loop perform arithmetic calculations involving `t` and `sum`, both of which are recalculated in each iteration. The calculation of `t` involves calling `ceil`, which may be inefficient given the integral nature of the problem.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **Invariant: Large Iteration Space**:
   - **Natural Language Description**: "The program slows significantly when the product of `m` and `b` (i.e., `m * b`) is very large, leading to excessive iterations in the primary loop. This is particularly noticeable when both `m` and `b` are near their upper limits, resulting in a large search space."
   - **Reasoning**: The loop's range is directly proportional to `m * b`, and larger values lead to more iterations and thus more computational overhead.

2. **Invariant: Expensive Computation in Tight Loop**:
   - **Natural Language Description**: "The use of the `ceil` function in calculating `t` within the loop can degrade performance when iterated over a large range. This is more pronounced when `m` is large, as it affects the divisor in the ceil operation, leading to more complex floating-point arithmetic."
   - **Reasoning**: While `ceil` is not inherently expensive, its repeated use in a loop with a high iteration count, especially with large divisors, can add up to substantial overhead.

3. **Invariant: Quadratic Summation Operations**:
   - **Natural Language Description**: "The summation formula in the loop involves quadratic terms, which perform numerous arithmetic operations per iteration. When combined with a high iteration count, this contributes to the slowdown."
   - **Reasoning**: The summation involves calculations like `(t * (t + 1) / 2)`, which are O(1) per iteration but involve multiple operations, adding up when iterated millions of times.

### Conclusion

These performance-characterizing invariants suggest that the code's slowdown is primarily due to the large loop iteration count driven by `m * b`, the use of non-integer arithmetic with `ceil`, and repeated complex arithmetic operations inside the loop. Addressing these areas, such as by optimizing the calculation of `t` and reducing unnecessary recalculations, could improve performance in scenarios where `m` and `b` are large.

### Phase 3: Implement Performance-Characterizing Invariants in C++

Let's translate the previously derived natural language invariants into C++ code:

1. **Invariant for Large Iteration Space**:
   - This check ensures that the product of `m` and `b` doesn't lead to an excessively large number of iterations, which could cause a slowdown.
   
   ```cpp
   void check_large_iteration_space_invariant(long long m, long long b) {
       if (m * b > 1e7) { // Arbitrary threshold based on saturation of performance
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large iteration space!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Invariant for Expensive Computation in Tight Loop**:
   - This check detects if the use of `ceil` in the loop is likely to degrade performance due to its execution frequency over many iterations.
   
   ```cpp
   void check_expensive_computation_invariant(long long m) {
       if (m > 500) { // Assumes large m affects `ceil` negatively in high iteration counts
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - expensive computation in loop!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Invariant for Quadratic Summation Operations**:
   - Checks whether the arithmetic operations in the loop will significantly slow down the program due to high iteration count and complexity.
   
   ```cpp
   void check_quadratic_summation_invariant(long long m, long long b) {
       if ((m * b) > 1e7) { // Simplified threshold for loop checks
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - quadratic summation operations!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Integrate Checks into the Original Program

Now, let's integrate these checks into the given C++ program, positioning them effectively to avoid additional overhead inside tight loops.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Define the check functions
void check_large_iteration_space_invariant(long long m, long long b) {
    if (m * b > 1e7) { // Arbitrary threshold based on saturation of performance
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large iteration space!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_expensive_computation_invariant(long long m) {
    if (m > 500) { // Assumes large m affects `ceil` negatively in high iteration counts
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - expensive computation in loop!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_quadratic_summation_invariant(long long m, long long b) {
    if ((m * b) > 1e7) { // Simplified threshold for loop checks
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - quadratic summation operations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    long long m, b;
    long long maxx = 0;
    cin >> m >> b;

    // Check for large iteration space
    check_large_iteration_space_invariant(m, b);
    
    // Check for expensive computation in loop
    check_expensive_computation_invariant(m);
    
    // Check for quadratic summation operations
    check_quadratic_summation_invariant(m, b);

    for (long long i = 0; i <= m * b; i++) {
        long long t = (-1) * ceil((float)i / m) + b;
        long long sum = (t * (t + 1) / 2) * (i + 1) + (i * (i + 1) / 2) * (t + 1);
        maxx = max(maxx, sum);
    }
    cout << maxx;
}
```

### Summary:

- **Placement of Checks**: All checks are placed immediately after reading input values to ensure they run before entering the computationally intensive loop.
- **Purpose of Each Check**: Each invariant is designed to warn about specific conditions leading to performance bottlenecks, aiding in identifying potential slow runs during testing or fuzzing.
