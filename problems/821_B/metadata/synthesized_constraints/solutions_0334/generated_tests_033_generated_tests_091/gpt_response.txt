=== Invariants Response ===
Based on the analysis of the provided C code and hit count information, let's identify the expensive or inefficient segments and derive performance-characterizing invariants.

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Line-level Hit Count Analysis**:
   - The function `f(pt t)` is called significantly more times in the slow run (9253 times) compared to the fast run (3 times). Within this function, the loop on line 14 (over `y`) is the primary contributor to the slowdown.
   - Specifically, lines 14, 15, and 16 within `f(pt t)` have much higher hit counts (up to 42,813,631 times in the slow input) than in the fast input (at most 9 times).

2. **Interaction with Data Structures and Loops**:
   - The loop from line 14 iterates over `y`, where `y` is derived from the input `b` and varies in the range `[0, b]`. This signifies that larger values of `b` lead to significantly more iterations of the loop.
   - The computation `dp[x] + (x + 1) * st` on line 15 is performed multiple times within this loop, contributing heavily to execution time.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **Invariant Related to the Size of `b`**:
   - **Natural Language Description**: "The performance of the program degrades significantly when the parameter `b` is large because it directly affects the number of iterations in a nested loop, leading to an increased number of computations."
   - **Explanation**: The loop on line 14, which runs from 0 to `y`, is executed once for each `i` in the outer loop (line 36) over `b`. Larger `b` results in larger `y` values, thus longer loops and higher hit counts for the inner operations.

2. **Invariant Related to the Accumulation in Loop**:
   - **Natural Language Description**: "If `b` becomes close to its upper constraint (10,000), the cumulative effect of nested loops over each point (x, y) under the line can lead to excessive computation times."
   - **Explanation**: The combined effect of traversing points `(x, y)` multiple times, especially when `b` reaches higher values, results in a quadratic increase in computation when generating cumulative sums (`dp[x] + (x + 1) * st`).

3. **Invariant Related to Memory Allocation**:
   - **Natural Language Description**: "A larger value of `m * b` leads to the allocation of large vectors, which might increase the setup time, further contributing to slowdowns."
   - **Explanation**: The vector `dp` is resized to `ox.x + 1` which is `b * m + 1`. Larger `b` and `m` values result in larger vectors, which increases both memory usage and initialization time.

### Conclusion

The main performance bottleneck is due to the nested loops influenced by the value of `b`, which results in a significant number of redundant calculations. By understanding these invariants, we can predict the scenarios under which the program's performance will degrade, especially as `b` approaches its upper limit of 10,000, causing a quadratic increase in operations.

=== Checker Response ===
Let's implement the performance-characterizing invariants as C++ checks and then integrate those checks into the original program.

### Phase 3: Implement the Natural Language Invariants into C++ Checkers

1. **Checking Large Values of `b`**:
   - We will check if `b` is large enough to likely cause performance issues due to extensive iterations. Since the problem constraints are `1 ≤ b ≤ 10000`, let's use a threshold like 9000 to indicate when `b` is approaching a size that could lead to performance degradation.

```cpp
void check_large_b_invariant(int b) {
    if (b > 9000) { 
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large value of b!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

2. **Checking Vector `dp` Size and Initialization Overhead**:
   - We will check if the size of `dp` (which depends on `m` and `b`) is excessively large, leading to costly initialization. Given `m` can be up to 1000, larger `b` values will result in larger vectors.

```cpp
void check_large_dp_invariant(int m, int b) {
    if (m * b > 9000000) { // This threshold is chosen based on typical memory concerns.
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large vector size!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrate Checkers into the Original Program

Now, let's integrate these checks into the given C++ program at appropriate places to avoid overhead in tight loops.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

const unsigned long long int INF = 10e8;

struct pt {
    double x;
    double y;
};

vector<unsigned long long int> dp;

unsigned long long int f(pt t) {
    int x = (int)t.x;
    int y = (int)t.y;
    unsigned long long int res(0);
    unsigned long long int st(0);
    for (int i(0); i <= y; i++) {
        res += dp[x] + (x + 1) * st;
        st++;
    }
    return res;
}

void check_large_b_invariant(int b) {
    if (b > 9000) { 
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large value of b!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_large_dp_invariant(int m, int b) {
    if (m * b > 9000000) { 
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large vector size!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

bool solve() {
    double m, b;
    cin >> m >> b;

    // Invariant checks
    check_large_b_invariant((int)b);
    check_large_dp_invariant((int)m, (int)b);

    pt ox, oy;
    ox.x = b * m;
    ox.y = 0;
    oy.x = 0;
    oy.y = b;

    dp.resize(ox.x + 1);
    unsigned long long int cr(0);
    for (int i(0); i < dp.size(); i++) {
        cr += i;
        dp[i] = cr;
    }

    pt tmp;
    unsigned long long int ans(0);
    for (int i(0); i <= b; i++) {
        tmp.x = (b - i) * m;
        tmp.y = i;
        ans = max(ans, f(tmp));
    }
    cout << ans;
    return 1;
}

int main() {
    solve();
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

- **`check_large_b_invariant` is called immediately after reading `b`**: This checks for large values of `b` that could cause performance issues due to extensive computations and iterations.
- **`check_large_dp_invariant` is invoked after reading `m` and `b`**: This checks if the product `m * b` results in a large vector allocation that could be inefficient in terms of memory usage and initialization time.

These checks are strategically placed to catch potential performance bottlenecks before the program proceeds with heavy computations. They help ensure that the program's performance characteristics are monitored dynamically and warned about during execution if conditions that would lead to slowdowns are detected.
