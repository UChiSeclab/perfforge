### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Compare Line-Level Hit Counts**:
   - The lines inside the loop (lines 15-17) are hit significantly more times for the slow input compared to the fast input.
   - Specifically, the function `gauss` (lines 3-7) is called extensively during both runs, but much more frequently for the slow input.

2. **Pinpoint Inefficient Lines**:
   - Line 15, which runs the loop, is a major contributor to inefficiency due to its dependency on the value of `X = m * b`. This value is substantial in the slow input (1061 * 8096), leading to many iterations.
   - The function `cb`, called on line 17, includes two calls to `gauss`, leading to further computational overhead.

3. **Interaction with Data Structures and Input Constraints**:
   - No complex data structures are involved, but the computation is heavily reliant on the loop bound `X`.
   - The loop iterates up to `X = m * b`, which makes the performance highly sensitive to the values of `m` and `b`.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **Invariant #1**: **Large Loop Iteration Count**
   - **Natural Language Description**: "When the product of `m` and `b` is large, resulting in a high number of loop iterations, the program's performance will degrade significantly. The execution time increases as the loop runs a number of times directly proportional to `m * b`."
   
2. **Invariant #2**: **Frequent Computation in Loop**
   - **Natural Language Description**: "If the loop frequently calls computational functions such as `gauss`, especially with large integer values, performance can degrade due to repeated calculations over a large range of values."
   
3. **Invariant #3**: **High Arithmetic Overhead**
   - **Natural Language Description**: "When arithmetic operations involving division and floor operations are repeated within a loop that runs for a large number of iterations, the cumulative computational cost may slow down the execution."

### Thresholds and Conditions
- **Choice of Thresholds**: Since `m` and `b` can each be as large as 10000, `m * b` can reach values up to 100,000,000. The key performance factor is the magnitude of `m * b`; a threshold that considers values where this product approaches higher limits within constraints should help identify slow scenarios.

### Summary
The program slows down considerably when:
- The product `m * b` is large, causing the main loop to iterate many times.
- Expensive computations like Gaussian summations are frequently repeated for large input values within this loop.
- Arithmetic operations inside the loop add additional processing overhead. 

By understanding these conditions, future slowdowns can be anticipated and analyzed for scenarios where `m` and `b` are at the upper limits within the given constraints.

### Phase 3: Implementing Performance Invariants in C++

We will create checker functions based on the performance-characterizing invariants derived earlier:

1. **Invariant #1: Large Loop Iteration Count**
   ```cpp
   void check_large_iteration_invariant(long long m, long long b) {
       if (m * b > 1000000) { // Arbitrary threshold chosen based on problem constraints
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large loop iteration count!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Invariant #2: Frequent Computation in Loop**
   ```cpp
   void check_frequent_computation_invariant(long long X) {
       if (X > 1000000) { // Threshold indicating many calls to the expensive function
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - frequent computations in loop!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Invariant #3: High Arithmetic Overhead**
   ```cpp
   // This invariant is a bit abstract to check directly, but you can infer it from frequent computation checks
   void check_high_arithmetic_overhead_invariant(long long X) {
       if (X > 1000000) { // Use similar threshold indicating potential arithmetic overhead
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high arithmetic overhead!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Integrating Checkers into the Original Program

Now, let's integrate these checkers into the original C++ program at appropriate locations:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Performance invariant checkers
void check_large_iteration_invariant(long long m, long long b) {
    if (m * b > 1000000) { // Arbitrary threshold chosen based on problem constraints
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large loop iteration count!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_frequent_computation_invariant(long long X) {
    if (X > 1000000) { // Threshold indicating many calls to the expensive function
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - frequent computations in loop!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_high_arithmetic_overhead_invariant(long long X) {
    if (X > 1000000) { // Use similar threshold indicating potential arithmetic overhead
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high arithmetic overhead!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

long long gauss(long long n) {
  if (n % 2 == 0)
    return n / 2 * (n + 1);
  else
    return n * (n + 1) / 2;
}

long long cb(int x, int y) { 
    return (x + 1) * gauss(y) + (y + 1) * gauss(x); 
}

int main() {
  long long m, b;
  cin >> m >> b;

  // Insert check for large iteration count
  check_large_iteration_invariant(m, b);

  long long X = m * b;
  long long res = 0;

  // Insert check for frequent computation in loop and high arithmetic overhead
  check_frequent_computation_invariant(X);
  check_high_arithmetic_overhead_invariant(X);

  for (int i = 0; i <= X; i++) {
    int y = floor(((double)i / m) * (-1) + b);
    res = max(res, cb(i, y));
  }
  
  cout << res << endl;
}
```

### Explanation

- **Checker Placement**: The checkers are placed after reading the input and before entering the loop to ensure they do not interfere with the main computation but still catch potentially slow conditions.
- **Threshold**: We used an arbitrary threshold of `1000000` for `m * b` and `X` to signal potential performance bottlenecks. This threshold can be adjusted based on further profiling or testing.
- **Abort on Trigger**: Each checker outputs a warning and then aborts execution to highlight the performance issue, simulating a mechanism useful for fuzzing or debugging.
