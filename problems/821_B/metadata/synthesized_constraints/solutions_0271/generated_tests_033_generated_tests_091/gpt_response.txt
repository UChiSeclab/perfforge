=== Invariants Response ===
To understand why the given C program runs slowly for the slow input, let's analyze the provided hit count information and derive performance-characterizing invariants.

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Comparison of Line-Level Hit Counts**:
   - The line within the `while (true)` loop and the nested `for` loop (lines 12-22) receives significantly more hits for the slow input (4,281,3628 hits) compared to the fast input (3 hits).
   - The condition `if (x / m == b)` on line 13 is executed 9,252 times for the slow input compared to 2 times for the fast input.
   - The nested loop (line 22) iterates for each value of `i` from `tmp1` down to 0, causing the bulk of the workload.

2. **Inference about Code Behavior**:
   - The outer loop continues to execute as long as `x / m != b`. This loop appears to increment `x` by `m` in each iteration, and the condition is only satisfied when `x` is exactly `m * b`.
   - The expression `b - (tmp / m)` (line 20) calculates `tmp1`, which directly influences the number of iterations in the nested loop.
   - The nested loop iterates based on the size of `tmp1`, and its high execution count indicates that `tmp1` is large for the slow input, resulting in many repeated calculations.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the analysis, here are the performance-characterizing invariants that describe when the program enters a slow path:

1. **Invariant on Loop Termination**:
   - **Natural Language Description**: "The program may slow down when the value of `b` is large, as the condition `x / m == b` requires many increments of `x` to satisfy, leading to excessive iterations of the outer loop."
   - **Threshold Consideration**: Although `b` is constrained (1 ≤ b ≤ 10,000), higher values of `b` can significantly increase the number of iterations in the outer loop.

2. **Invariant on Nested Loop Iterations**:
   - **Natural Language Description**: "Performance degradation can occur when the calculated value `tmp1` from the expression `b - (tmp / m)` is large, as this leads to numerous iterations of the nested loop, causing increased computation."
   - **Input Pattern Correlation**: This situation arises when the line equation's slope leads to `x` values that climb slowly, making `tmp1` large.

3. **Invariant on Combined Loop Behavior**:
   - **Natural Language Description**: "If the combination of `m` and `b` results in a large number of permissible rectangle configurations, the program may experience slowdowns due to extensive loop execution."
   - **Correlation to Input Patterns**: Inputs are more likely to slow the program when `m` and `b` create a rectangle configuration space larger than typical.

These invariants help identify scenarios that could lead to long execution times, especially when larger values of `b` interact with the loop structure to cause extensive iteration. By focusing on these conditions, future scenarios of slow performance can be detected and mitigated.

=== Checker Response ===
Below are the C++ code snippets that implement the performance-characterizing invariants derived from Phase 2.

### Phase 3: Implementing the Natural Language Invariants in C++

1. **Invariant on Loop Termination**:
   - **Condition**: The program may slow down when the value of `b` is large, as it requires many increments of `x` to satisfy `x / m == b`.
   - **Checker Code**:
   ```cpp
   void check_large_b_invariant(int b) {
       if (b > 5000) { // Choosing a threshold for large b
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to large b!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Invariant on Nested Loop Iterations**:
   - **Condition**: Performance degradation can occur when the calculated value `tmp1` from `b - (tmp / m)` is large.
   - **Checker Code**:
   ```cpp
   void check_large_tmp1_invariant(unsigned long long tmp1) {
       if (tmp1 > 5000) { // Choosing a threshold for large tmp1
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to large tmp1!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Invariant on Combined Loop Behavior**:
   - **Condition**: If `m` and `b` create a large rectangle configuration space, performance may slow.
   - **Checker Code**:
   ```cpp
   void check_combined_invariant(int m, int b) {
       if (m * b > 500000) { // Arbitrary threshold for large configuration space
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to large m * b configuration!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Integrating the Checker Code into the Original Program

Below is the modified C++ program with the integrated runtime checks:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Invariant checkers
void check_large_b_invariant(int b) {
    if (b > 5000) { // Choosing a threshold for large b
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to large b!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_large_tmp1_invariant(unsigned long long tmp1) {
    if (tmp1 > 5000) { // Choosing a threshold for large tmp1
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to large tmp1!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_combined_invariant(int m, int b) {
    if (m * b > 500000) { // Arbitrary threshold for large configuration space
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to large m * b configuration!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
    unsigned long long b, m, ans, x, tmp, tmp1, kq;
    cin >> m >> b;

    // Check invariants based on input
    check_large_b_invariant(b);
    check_combined_invariant(m, b);

    if (b == 1) {
        cout << (m * (m + 1)) / 2;
    } else {
        x = m;
        ans = 0;
        while (true) {
            if (x / m == b) {
                unsigned long long a = ((x * (x + 1)) / 2) % 1000000000000000000;
                ans = max(ans, a);
                ans %= 1000000000000000000;
                break;
            }
            tmp = x;
            tmp1 = b - (tmp / m);

            // Check invariant inside loop
            check_large_tmp1_invariant(tmp1);

            kq = 0;
            for (int i = tmp1; i >= 0; i--) {
                kq = (kq + (tmp * (tmp + 1)) / 2 + (tmp * i)) % 1000000000000000000;
            }
            kq = (kq + (tmp1 * (tmp1 + 1)) / 2) % 1000000000000000000;
            ans = max(ans, kq);
            ans %= 1000000000000000000;
            x += m;
        }
        cout << (ans + 1000000000000000000) % 1000000000000000000;
    }
}
```

### Explanation
- The checks are added before the main computation loop begins to avoid adding overhead in nested loops.
- The `check_large_tmp1_invariant()` is strategically placed to monitor the `tmp1` value before the nested loop begins, which is critical for identifying potential slowdowns.
- These checks ensure that the program aborts when it encounters a scenario that could lead to performance bottlenecks, thus aiding in debugging and optimization efforts.
