### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Comparison of Line-Level Hit Counts:**
   - The outer loop (`for (i = 0; i <= (m * b); i = i + m)`) iterates significantly more times in the slow input (9254 times) compared to the fast input (8 times).
   - The inner loop (`for (j = 0; j <= y; j++)`) is particularly notable, being executed 42,822,884 times for the slow input versus just 35 times for the fast input.
   - Lines 11 and 12, which compute portions of `ans`, are hit a similar number of times to the inner loop, indicating that these operations are repeated quite often.

2. **Analysis of Iteration and Computation:**
   - The outer loop range depends on `m * b`, which is significantly larger for the slow input.
   - The inner loop iterates over `y` times, where `y = ((-i) / m) + b`. The value `y` can be large, leading to a high number of iterations in the inner loop.
   - The operations inside the inner loop involve arithmetic summations that are repeatedly calculated, leading to performance bottlenecks for large values of `m * b`.

3. **Interacting with Data Structures:**
   - There are no complex data structures in use, but the computation involves summing arithmetic sequences, both for `i` and `j`. The number of arithmetic operations scales with the values of `m` and `b`.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants (Natural Language)

1. **Invariant: Large Outer Loop Iterations**
   - "If the product of `m` and `b` is large, the outer loop iterates many times, leading to potential slow execution. This is because the loop condition `i <= (m * b)` heavily depends on `m` and `b`, and hence when both have relatively high values, the loop scales up."

2. **Invariant: Nested Loop with High Iteration Count**
   - "When `b` is significantly larger than `m`, the nested loop (controlled by `j <= y`) results in many iterations, particularly because `y = ((-i) / m) + b` can have high values for small `i`. This can lead to a substantial number of arithmetic operations being performed for moderate values of `m` and large values of `b`."

3. **Invariant: Arithmetic Operations Overhead**
   - "The inner loop performs repeated arithmetic operations, which can degrade performance if `y` is large. High values of `y`, generated by larger values of `b`, result in numerous summations for each iteration of `i`, causing cumulative computational overhead."

4. **Invariant: Dependency on Linear Constraint**
   - "The performance is impacted by the linear constraint implied by the line in the 2D plane. The extent to which points are evaluated (on or under the line) can result in quadratic-like growth in computation based on the input values, particularly when `b` dominates the line's equation, leading to expansive coverage on the plane."

These invariants help recognize conditions leading to slow program execution and can guide optimizations or alternative approaches for handling large input values within specified constraints.

### Phase 3: Implementing Invariants as C++ Checkers

Here are the C++ code snippets for the performance-characterizing invariants inferred previously:

1. **Checker for Large Outer Loop Iterations:**
   ```cpp
   void check_outer_loop_invariant(long long m, long long b) {
       if (m * b > 10000) {  // Arbitrary threshold considering m (max 1000) and b (max 10000)
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large outer loop iterations!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Checker for Nested Loop with High Iteration Count:**
   ```cpp
   void check_inner_loop_invariant(long long i, long long m, long long b) {
       long long y = ((-i) / m) + b;
       if (y > 1000) {  // Arbitrary threshold to detect high iterations in inner loop
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high inner loop iterations!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Checker for Arithmetic Operations Overhead:**
   ```cpp
   void check_arithmetic_invariant(long long m, long long b) {
       if (m * b > 5000) {  // Arbitrary threshold considering potential arithmetic overhead
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high arithmetic operations!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Integrating Checkers with the Program

Here's the instrumented C++ program with the performance checkers integrated:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Checker for large outer loop iterations
void check_outer_loop_invariant(long long m, long long b) {
    if (m * b > 10000) {  // Arbitrary threshold considering maximum input constraints
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large outer loop iterations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Checker for nested loop with high iteration count
void check_inner_loop_invariant(long long i, long long m, long long b) {
    long long y = ((-i) / m) + b;
    if (y > 1000) {  // Arbitrary threshold to detect high iterations in inner loop
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high inner loop iterations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Checker for arithmetic operations overhead
void check_arithmetic_invariant(long long m, long long b) {
    if (m * b > 5000) {  // Arbitrary threshold considering potential arithmetic overhead
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high arithmetic operations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    long long int m, b, i, j;
    cin >> m >> b;

    // Check for performance bottlenecks based on the input parameters
    check_outer_loop_invariant(m, b);
    check_arithmetic_invariant(m, b);

    long long int max = 0, ans = 0;
    for (i = 0; i <= (m * b); i = i + m) {
        ans = 0;
        long long int y = ((-i) / m) + b;

        // Check each iteration of the outer loop for potential inner loop bottlenecks
        check_inner_loop_invariant(i, m, b);

        for (j = 0; j <= y; j++) {
            ans += (i * (i + 1)) / 2;
            ans += j * (i + 1);
        }
        if (ans > max) {
            max = ans;
        }
    }
    cout << max << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:

- **Outer Loop Check:** This check is placed right after reading inputs to ensure that the outer loop does not iterate excessively.
- **Inner Loop Check:** This check is inside the outer loop but before the inner loop starts, ensuring that the inner loop does not iterate too many times for any given outer loop iteration.
- **Arithmetic Operations Check:** This check is also placed after reading inputs, similar to the outer loop check, to prevent arithmetic overhead from large calculations early on. 

By integrating these checks, the program will warn and abort if it is likely to encounter a performance bottleneck due to the reasons identified in the natural language invariants.
