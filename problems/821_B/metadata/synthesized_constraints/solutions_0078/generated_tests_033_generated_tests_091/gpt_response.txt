### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

Based on the provided hit counts, the slowdown is primarily due to lines 13 to 15, which are inside a nested loop. Here's the detailed analysis:

1. **Outer Loop (line 9):**
   - `slow_hit_count: 9254`
   - `fast_hit_count: 4`
   - This loop runs significantly more times for the slow input.

2. **Inner Loop (line 13):**
   - `slow_hit_count: 42822884`
   - `fast_hit_count: 9`
   - The inner loop is executed an extremely large number of times for the slow input compared to the fast input, indicating quadratic complexity with respect to some input parameter.

3. **Lines inside Inner Loop (lines 14 and 15):**
   - `slow_hit_count: 42813631`
   - `fast_hit_count: 6`
   - These lines are responsible for the majority of operations and are hit very frequently due to the nested loop structure.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the analysis, here are the natural language performance invariants that describe conditions under which the code slows down:

1. **Invariant 1: High Value of `b` Leading to Quadratic Execution**
   - **Description:** If the value of `b` is large, the outer loop iterates over a large range, and the inner loop becomes quadratic in nature, causing an excessive number of operations.
   - **Condition:** "When the parameter `b` is high, the nested loops result in quadratically many operations, significantly slowing down the computation."

2. **Invariant 2: Large Rectangle Area with High Loop Iterations**
   - **Description:** The number of iterations in the inner loop is directly proportional to the size of the rectangle area being calculated, which grows large for higher values of `b`.
   - **Condition:** "If the rectangular area defined by the input parameters is large, the computation involves a high number of loop iterations leading to performance bottlenecks."

3. **Invariant 3: Accumulation of Sum in Nested Loops**
   - **Description:** The sum computation within nested loops accumulates for every possible rectangle height, which becomes expensive as `b` increases.
   - **Condition:** "The accumulation of sums over all possible heights of the rectangle becomes costly when `b` is large, leading to slow program execution."

### Summary

The performance bottleneck for the slow input is mainly due to the high value of `b`, which increases the range of the outer loop and compounds the effect with the inner loop, leading to a large number of operations. This results in a quadratic time complexity relative to the rectangle dimensions specified by the inputs. The conditions described capture when and why the algorithm experiences slowdowns, abstracted away from specific numeric values.

### Phase 3: Implementing Checker Code in C++

Below are the C++ code snippets implementing the performance-characterizing invariants identified in Phase 2:

1. **Invariant 1: High Value of `b` Leading to Quadratic Execution**
   ```cpp
   void check_large_b_invariant(long long b) {
       if (b > 5000) {  // Assuming a threshold based on experience; adjust as necessary
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to large 'b' value triggering excessive iterations!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Invariant 2: Large Rectangle Area with High Loop Iterations**
   ```cpp
   void check_large_rectangle_invariant(long long m, long long b) {
       if (m * b > 5000000) {  // Threshold suggests when rectangle area leads to too many iterations
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to large rectangle area leading to high loop count!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Invariant 3: Accumulation of Sum in Nested Loops**
   ```cpp
   void check_accumulation_invariant(long long b) {
       if (b > 3000) {  // A separate threshold for when accumulation becomes expensive
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck caused by excessive accumulation in nested loops!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```
   
### Phase 4: Integrating Checker Code into the Original C++ Program

Below is the instrumented C++ program with the implemented checks:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Checkers for performance bottlenecks
void check_large_b_invariant(long long b) {
    if (b > 5000) {  // Threshold for 'b' indicating potential performance bottleneck
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to large 'b' value triggering excessive iterations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_large_rectangle_invariant(long long m, long long b) {
    if (m * b > 5000000) {  // Threshold for rectangle area leading to too many iterations
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck due to large rectangle area leading to high loop count!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_accumulation_invariant(long long b) {
    if (b > 3000) {  // Threshold for excessive sum accumulation in loops
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck caused by excessive accumulation in nested loops!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    long long m, b;
    cin >> m >> b;

    // Insert checker calls after input
    check_large_b_invariant(b);
    check_large_rectangle_invariant(m, b);
    check_accumulation_invariant(b);

    long long y = b;
    long long x = b * m;
    long long max1 = 0;
    for (long long iy = b; iy >= 0; iy--) {
        long long ix = m * (b - iy);
        long long sum = 0;
        long long sumx = (ix * (ix + 1)) / 2;
        for (long long j = iy; j >= 0; j--) {
            long long sumy = (ix + 1) * j;
            sum += sumx + sumy;
        }
        if (max1 < sum) max1 = sum;
    }
    cout << max1 << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

- **Checker Function Placement:** The checkers are placed immediately after reading the inputs, ensuring they do not add overhead during the main computational loops.
- **Threshold Values:** The thresholds are deliberately set to hypothetical values based on experience and should be adjusted according to further testing and profiling if needed.
- **Warnings and Aborts:** The checkers print a warning and abort execution if the condition is met, aiding in the identification of potential performance bottlenecks during testing.
