system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

We define x mod y as the remainder of division of x by y (\% operator in C++ or Java, mod operator in Pascal).

Let's call an array of positive integers [a_1, a_2, ..., a_k] stable if for every permutation p of integers from 1 to k, and for every non-negative integer x, the following condition is met:

 (((x mod a_1) mod a_2) ... mod a_{k - 1}) mod a_k = (((x mod a_{p_1}) mod a_{p_2}) ... mod a_{p_{k - 1}}) mod a_{p_k}  

That is, for each non-negative integer x, the value of (((x mod a_1) mod a_2) ... mod a_{k - 1}) mod a_k does not change if we reorder the elements of the array a.

For two given integers n and k, calculate the number of stable arrays [a_1, a_2, ..., a_k] such that 1 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_k ≤ n.

Input

The only line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^5).

Output

Print one integer — the number of stable arrays [a_1, a_2, ..., a_k] such that 1 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_k ≤ n. Since the answer may be large, print it modulo 998244353.

assistant: ### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

Based on the hit count information provided, the following key observations can be made:

1. **Function `fast_pow`**: This function is heavily hit during the slow run, with a total of 58,000,000 hits on line 24. This indicates the function is called repeatedly for large values of `x` or `y`, causing recursive computation and likely contributing to the slowdown.

2. **Function `back`**: This function calls `fast_pow`, and the line 30 has a hit count of 1,000,000. This means `back` is indirectly invoking the expensive recursion within `fast_pow`.

3. **Combination Calculation `c`**: Lines 31-33 collectively have 500,000 hits in the slow input. The combination calculations involve calling `back`, which further suggests that this is a bottleneck due to repeated factorial calculations and modular inverses.

4. **Loop in `solve` Function**: The loop on line 41 runs `n` times (500,000 in the slow input), and within this loop, the combination function `c` is called. The heavy hit count here suggests that the loop and its calls to expensive functions are a primary candidate for performance issues.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

With the insights from Phase 1, the following performance-characterizing invariants can be derived:

1. **Invariant: Expensive Recursive Power Computation**
   - **Natural Language Description**: "If the function `fast_pow` is called repeatedly, especially with large exponents, the recursive computations result in high execution time. This typically happens when computing modular inverses for large factorials repeatedly."
   - **Condition**: Avoid large values for `y` in `fast_pow`, particularly when `n` is large, as this leads to excessive recursive calls.
   
2. **Invariant: High Iteration Count for Combination Calculations**
   - **Natural Language Description**: "If the loop iterating over `n` involves frequent calls to the combination function `c`, which in turn calculates modular inverses for factorial values, performance degrades due to repeated expensive computations."
   - **Condition**: When `n` is large and `k` is small, the loop effectively iterates `n` times, invoking expensive operations repeatedly.

3. **Invariant: Large Factorial Calculations and Modular Inverses**
   - **Natural Language Description**: "The performance is impacted when the calculation of large factorials and their modular inverses are involved repeatedly in a loop. This is primarily due to the overhead of calculating large factorial values and their inverses."
   - **Condition**: If the factorial array needs to be initialized with many elements (close to `n`), and its inverses are computed often, this creates a bottleneck.

These invariants help describe the conditions under which the program performance can degrade, particularly focusing on recursive power calculations and factorial operations within loops. They highlight the inherent inefficiencies in repeated heavy computations for large values of `n` and small values of `k`, where `n > 100,000` is a typical threshold leading to performance slowdowns.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
We define x mod y as the remainder of division of x by y (\% operator in C++ or Java, mod operator in Pascal).

Let's call an array of positive integers [a_1, a_2, ..., a_k] stable if for every permutation p of integers from 1 to k, and for every non-negative integer x, the following condition is met:

 (((x mod a_1) mod a_2) ... mod a_{k - 1}) mod a_k = (((x mod a_{p_1}) mod a_{p_2}) ... mod a_{p_{k - 1}}) mod a_{p_k}  

That is, for each non-negative integer x, the value of (((x mod a_1) mod a_2) ... mod a_{k - 1}) mod a_k does not change if we reorder the elements of the array a.

For two given integers n and k, calculate the number of stable arrays [a_1, a_2, ..., a_k] such that 1 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_k ≤ n.

Input

The only line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^5).

Output

Print one integer — the number of stable arrays [a_1, a_2, ..., a_k] such that 1 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_k ≤ n. Since the answer may be large, print it modulo 998244353.

assistant: ### Phase 3: Implement the Natural Language Invariants in C++

Below are the C++ code snippets implementing the checks derived from the natural language invariants:

1. **Invariant: Expensive Recursive Power Computation**
   - This check ensures that the `fast_pow` function is not called with excessively large exponents, which would lead to expensive recursive computations.

```cpp
void check_fast_pow_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive recursive calls in fast_pow!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

2. **Invariant: High Iteration Count for Combination Calculations**
   - This check ensures that the loop does not result in an excessive number of calls to the combination function, which involves expensive modular inverses.

```cpp
void check_combination_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive combination calculations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

3. **Invariant: Large Factorial Calculations and Modular Inverses**
   - This check ensures that the factorial and inverse calculations are not repeated excessively, which could impact performance.

```cpp
void check_factorial_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive factorial calculations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrate Checker Code into the Original C++ Program

Below is the modified version of the original program with the performance checks integrated at appropriate points. The checks are strategically placed to avoid significant overhead in tight loops.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

const long long mod = (long long)998244353;
const long long MAXN = (long long)5e5 + 1;

long long fact[MAXN];

// Checker function for fast_pow
void check_fast_pow_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive recursive calls in fast_pow!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Checker function for combination calculations
void check_combination_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive combination calculations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Checker function for factorial calculations
void check_factorial_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive factorial calculations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

long long fast_pow(long long x, long long y) {
    check_fast_pow_invariant(y > 1e6); // Check before recursive calculations
    if (!y) return 1;
    if (y % 2) return (x * fast_pow(x, y - 1)) % mod;
    long long c = fast_pow(x, y / 2);
    return (c * c) % mod;
}

long long back(long long x) { return fast_pow(x, mod - 2); }

long long c(long long n, long long k) {
    if (k > n) return 0;
    return fact[n] * back(fact[n - k]) % mod * back(fact[k]) % mod;
}

void solve() {
    long long n, k;
    cin >> n >> k;

    fact[0] = 1;
    for (long long i = 1; i <= n; ++i) fact[i] = (fact[i - 1] * i) % mod;

    check_factorial_invariant(n > 1e5); // Check after factorial initialization

    long long ans = 0;

    for (long long i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        check_combination_invariant(i > 1e5 && k < 10); // Check during loop iteration
        ans += c(n / i - 1, k - 1);
        ans %= mod;
    }
    cout << ans;
}

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(nullptr);
    cout.tie(nullptr);
    solve();
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:

- **Fast Power Check**: Before entering potentially expensive recursive calls within `fast_pow`, a check ensures that `y` isn't excessively large.
- **Combination Calculation Check**: During the loop in `solve`, a check ensures that the loop's iteration and combination calculations do not become excessive.
- **Factorial Calculation Check**: After initializing the factorial array, a check ensures that initialization isn't dealing with excessively large sizes, which could impact performance. 

These checks will trigger warnings and abort execution if the conditions suggesting possible performance bottlenecks are met.
