### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Line-Level Hit Count Analysis:**
   - **`mod_pow` Function Calls (Lines 7-11):** 
     - This function is heavily hit in the slow input with counts of 58,000,000 hits for line 8 and significant hits on lines 9-11. This suggests it is a recursive function that is a performance bottleneck.
   - **Factorial and Inverse Factorial Calculations (Lines 26-31):**
     - Loops at lines 26 and 29 are executed 1,000,000 times, indicating large pre-computation tasks for factorial and modular inverses.
   - **Combination Calculations (Lines 33-37):**
     - The loop iterating from 1 to `k` (500,000 iterations) interacts with the combination function `c` indicating heavy computation.

2. **Interaction with Data Structures and Constraints:**
   - The hit counts indicate that the slow input involves a large amount of modular exponentiation and pre-computation of factorials and modular inverses.
   - The loop from line 33 is a key contributor to the problem's complexity, as it iterates over a range determined by input size `k`.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **Invariant 1: Heavy Recursive Calls**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "If the program frequently calls a recursive modular exponentiation function with large powers, especially in setups requiring many factorial pre-computations (like when `k` is large), the execution time can increase significantly."
   - **Threshold Suggestion:** Recursive depth or `k` close to its maximum constraint, causing repeated recursion.

2. **Invariant 2: Pre-computation and Memory Usage**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "When `n` or `k` approaches their upper limits, the pre-computation of factorials and their inverses becomes a bottleneck due to the large size of pre-computed arrays."
   - **Threshold Suggestion:** Arrays size of `maxN`, causing intensive memory operations at initialization.

3. **Invariant 3: Iterative Combinations**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "A slowdown is likely when `k` is large and combinations are calculated multiple times in loops, as the constant recomputation becomes expensive."
   - **Threshold Suggestion:** Iteration count tied to `k`, especially when `k` is close to its upper bound.

### Output: Performance-Characterizing Invariants

- **Invariant 1: Recursive Depth and Modular Calculations**
  - "The execution may slow significantly when the recursive modular exponentiation function is called with large powers, especially in situations requiring extensive factorial pre-computations."
  
- **Invariant 2: Factorial Pre-computation**
  - "Significant slowdowns occur when the input size approaches limits, triggering large pre-computation of factorials and inverses, leading to expensive setup and memory operations."

- **Invariant 3: Intensive Loop-Based Computation**
  - "When `k` is large, and combinations are computed repeatedly in a loop, the performance degrades due to the constant overhead of these calculations." 

These invariants provide a framework for understanding potential performance bottlenecks in similar contexts, helping to identify conditions where the code might enter a path that results in prolonged execution times.

### Phase 3: Implementing Invariants as C++ Checkers

Let's implement the performance-characterizing invariants derived earlier into C++ checkers:

1. **Invariant 1: Recursive Depth and Modular Calculations**

```cpp
void check_mod_pow_invariant(long long b) {
    if (b > 1000000) {  // Assuming a threshold for deep recursion
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive recursion in mod_pow!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

2. **Invariant 2: Factorial Pre-computation**

```cpp
void check_factorial_invariant(long long maxN) {
    if (maxN >= 1000000) {  // Pre-computation size that might be too large
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large factorial pre-computation!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

3. **Invariant 3: Intensive Loop-Based Computation**

```cpp
void check_combination_invariant(long long k) {
    if (k > 400000) {  // Threshold close to the problem's upper limit where loops become intensive
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive combination calculations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrating Checkers into the Program

Now, let's integrate these checker functions into the provided C++ solution.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

const long long INF = 2e9;
const long long MB = 20;
const long long MOD = 998244353;
const long long maxN = 1e6;

long long mod_pow(long long a, long long b) {
    check_mod_pow_invariant(b);  // Check for deep recursion
    if (!b) return 1;
    if (b % 2) return a * mod_pow(a, b - 1) % MOD;
    long long q = mod_pow(a, b / 2);
    return q * q % MOD;
}

long long fact[maxN], rev[maxN];

long long c(long long n, long long k) {
    if (n < k) return 0;
    return (fact[n] * rev[k] % MOD) * rev[n - k] % MOD;
}

void solve() {
    long long n, k;
    cin >> k >> n;
    
    if (n > k) {
        cout << 0;
        return;
    }
    
    // Check for factorial pre-computation size
    check_factorial_invariant(maxN);
    
    fact[0] = 1;
    for (long long i = 1; i < maxN; i++) {
        fact[i] = fact[i - 1] * i % MOD;
    }
    
    for (long long i = 0; i < maxN; i++) {
        rev[i] = mod_pow(fact[i], MOD - 2);
    }
    
    long long ans = 0;
    
    // Check for combination computation overhead
    check_combination_invariant(k);
    
    for (long long i = 1; i <= k; i++) {
        long long cnt = k / i - 1;
        ans += c(cnt, n - 1);
        ans %= MOD;
    }
    
    cout << ans;
}

signed main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(nullptr);
    cout.tie(nullptr);
    cout << fixed;
    cout.precision(12);
    srand(time(0));
    long long t = 1;
    while (t--) solve();
}
```

### Explanation

- **Integration Strategy:** The checker functions are placed at strategic points in the program to avoid adding overhead within tight loops. They serve to warn and abort the program when entering potentially slow execution paths.
- **Checker Definitions:**
  - `check_mod_pow_invariant` is called within `mod_pow` to check for recursive depths.
  - `check_factorial_invariant` is called before initializing the factorials to ensure that the pre-computation size is manageable.
  - `check_combination_invariant` is applied before the combination calculations to ensure that `k` is within a reasonable range to avoid excessive computation in the loop.

These checks will help identify when the program might enter a slow path, aiding performance debugging and optimization efforts.
