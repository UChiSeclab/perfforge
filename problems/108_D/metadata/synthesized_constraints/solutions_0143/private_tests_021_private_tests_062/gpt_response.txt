To diagnose the performance bottlenecks in the provided C code, let's go through the hit count information and understand the context as per the tasks outlined in the problem statement.

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Comparing Line-Level Hit Counts:**
   - Lines 14-16 are part of a loop iterating over `m`, hitting 90 times for the slow input, compared to 9 times for the fast input. This indicates that the slow input has significantly more departments.
   - Lines 40-50 represent a loop for computing the probability. This loop is hit 33 times for the slow input versus 5 times for the fast input. This indicates that the size of `n` is directly impacting the performance.
   - Within this loop, line 45, which involves a nested loop, is hit 527 times for the slow input, while only 9 times for the fast input. This suggests that `f` grows large, leading to a potentially quadratic complexity in some part of this loop.

2. **Pinpointing Lines or Functions with Significant Hits:**
   - The nested loop at line 45, particularly, is an area of concern. The complexity of this part of the code increases as `f` increases, and `f` corresponds to the number of iterations required to meet the conditions set in the loop.
   - This nested behavior seems to be the core of the performance issue, especially with larger `n`.

3. **Interaction with Data Structures and Input Constraints:**
   - The array `a` is accessed and updated frequently. The operations on this array, especially when calculating combinations or probabilities, contribute to the slowdown.
   - Given that `n <= 100`, the loop's interactions with this constraint are critical in understanding performance bottlenecks.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants (Natural Language)

Based on the observations:

1. **Invariant 1: High Number of Departments**
   - **Description:** If there are many departments (`m` is large) and the loop iterating over them (lines 14-16) is executed extensively, the program may slow down due to increased computation for each department's students.
   - **Threshold:** When `m` approaches its upper limit (e.g., significantly higher than average smaller cases).

2. **Invariant 2: Large Team Size with Nested Loop**
   - **Description:** When `n` is close to its upper limit, the computation within the loop (lines 40-50) becomes expensive due to the nested loop operations, particularly when `f` grows significantly due to the combination calculations.
   - **Threshold:** Large values of `n` leading to high iterations in the loop.

3. **Invariant 3: High Repeated Operations in Calculation**
   - **Description:** If the nested loop (line 45) iterates a large number of times due to `f` being large, the multiplication operations can lead to performance degradation.
   - **Threshold:** High values of `f`, which can be correlated with how `n` and `s - a[h]` are effectively manipulated.

These performance-characterizing invariants are tailored to capture scenarios that could lead to slow execution, considering the constraints and typical input scenarios without relying on specific numeric values from the provided slow input.

### Phase 3: Implementing Performance-Characterizing Invariants in C++

Based on the natural language invariants from Phase 2, we need to implement checker functions in C++ that will help identify potential performance bottlenecks.

Here are the implementations:

#### Invariant 1: High Number of Departments
```cpp
void check_high_departments_invariant(int m) {
    if (m > 500) { // Arbitrary threshold considering m's upper limit is 1000
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - too many departments!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

#### Invariant 2: Large Team Size with Nested Loop
```cpp
void check_large_team_size_invariant(int n) {
    if (n > 50) { // Threshold close to n's upper limit
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large team size leading to expensive nested loops!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

#### Invariant 3: High Repeated Operations in Calculation
```cpp
void check_repeated_operations_invariant(double s, double a_h) {
    if (s - a_h > 70) { // Threshold to determine repeated operations becoming costly
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high repeated operations in calculation!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrating Checker Functions into the Original Program

We will insert these checks at appropriate points in the original C++ program.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Checker function for high number of departments
void check_high_departments_invariant(int m) {
    if (m > 500) { // Arbitrary threshold considering m's upper limit is 1000
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - too many departments!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Checker function for large team size
void check_large_team_size_invariant(int n) {
    if (n > 50) { // Threshold close to n's upper limit
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large team size leading to expensive nested loops!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Checker function for high repeated operations
void check_repeated_operations_invariant(double s, double a_h) {
    if (s - a_h > 70) { // Threshold to determine repeated operations becoming costly
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high repeated operations in calculation!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    double n;
    int m;
    int h;
    cin >> n;
    cin >> m;
    cin >> h;

    // Check for high number of departments
    check_high_departments_invariant(m);

    double a[m];
    double s = 0;
    n--;
    h--;
    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        cin >> a[i];
        s += a[i];
    }
    a[h]--;
    s--;

    // Check for repeated operations in calculation
    check_repeated_operations_invariant(s, a[h]);

    if (s < n) {
        cout << -1.0 << endl;
        return 0;
    }
    if (s == n && a[h] != 0) {
        cout << 1.0 << endl;
        return 0;
    }
    if (a[h] == 0) {
        cout << 0.0 << endl;
        return 0;
    }
    if (s - a[h] < n) {
        cout << 1.0 << endl;
        return 0;
    }
    s = s - a[h];
    double res = 0;
    double r;
    int f = 0;

    // Check for large team size
    check_large_team_size_invariant(static_cast<int>(n) + 1);

    while (n) {
        if (f == 0) {
            res = (double)(a[h] / (s + a[h]));
        } else {
            r = (a[h] / ((s - f) + a[h]));
            for (int i = 0; i < f; i++) r *= (s - i) / (s + a[h] - i);
            res += r;
        }
        n--;
        f++;
    }
    cout << res << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

- **High Number of Departments Check:** This check is inserted after reading `m`. It warns and aborts if `m` exceeds a threshold that might cause performance issues.
  
- **Large Team Size Check:** Inserted before entering the loop that calculates the probability, ensuring `n` is not too large to lead to expensive nested loops.
  
- **Repeated Operations Check:** Placed after calculating `s` and adjusting `a[h]`, ensuring calculations won't be too costly. 

These checks effectively capture the conditions leading to performance degradation while adhering to the constraints and problem context.
