system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

As a German University in Cairo (GUC) student and a basketball player, Herr Wafa was delighted once he heard the news. GUC is finally participating in the Annual Basketball Competition (ABC). 

A team is to be formed of n players, all of which are GUC students. However, the team might have players belonging to different departments. There are m departments in GUC, numbered from 1 to m. Herr Wafa's department has number h. For each department i, Herr Wafa knows number si — how many students who play basketball belong to this department.

Herr Wafa was also able to guarantee a spot on the team, using his special powers. But since he hates floating-point numbers, he needs your help at finding the probability that he will have at least one teammate belonging to his department. 

Note that every possible team containing Herr Wafa is equally probable. Consider all the students different from each other.

Input

The first line contains three integers n, m and h (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ h ≤ m) — the number of players on the team, the number of departments in GUC and Herr Wafa's department, correspondingly. 

The second line contains a single-space-separated list of m integers si (1 ≤ si ≤ 100), denoting the number of students in the i-th department. Note that sh includes Herr Wafa.

Output

Print the probability that Herr Wafa will have at least one teammate from his department. If there is not enough basketball players in GUC to participate in ABC, print -1. The answer will be accepted if it has absolute or relative error not exceeding 10 - 6.

Note

In the first example all 3 players (2 from department 1 and 1 from department 2) must be chosen for the team. Both players from Wafa's departments will be chosen, so he's guaranteed to have a teammate from his department.

In the second example, there are not enough players.

In the third example, there are three possibilities to compose the team containing Herr Wafa. In two of them the other player from Herr Wafa's department is part of the team.

assistant: ### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

Upon examining the hit counts and the code provided, we can observe the following:

1. **Function `C(int n, int r)`**:
   - Lines 3 through 7 are significantly more frequently hit in the slow input case.
   - In particular, the loops inside this function (lines 5 and 6) have very high hit counts (10,099 on the slow input vs. 100 on the fast input), indicating that the combination calculation is a performance bottleneck.

2. **Loop in `main()` Function**:
   - The loop at line 24 is executed 100 times on the slow input but only once on the fast input. This loop computes combinations using the `C` function, which further exacerbates the slow down due to repeated costly calculations.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the analysis in Phase 1, here are some performance-characterizing invariants for the slowdowns observed:

1. **High Combination Count**:
   - **Natural Language Invariant**: "If the number of students in Herr Wafa's department (`s[h]`) is close to the number of total players needed (`n`), and the loop calculates combinations for many values, the program may slow down significantly due to repeated expensive computation of combinations."
   - **Reason**: When `s[h]` is large, particularly when `s[h]` approaches `n`, the loop in line 24 runs many iterations, causing repeated evaluations of combinations which are computationally intensive.

2. **Loop Execution Overhead**:
   - **Natural Language Invariant**: "The performance can degrade when a loop iterating over potential team formations (considering each possible teammate from Herr Wafa's department) runs many times, especially if `s[h]` is large and `n` is close to its maximum constraint."
   - **Reason**: The loop's duration is contingent upon the size of `s[h]`, with more iterations resulting in more calls to the expensive combination function `C`.

3. **Combination Function Complexity**:
   - **Natural Language Invariant**: "Frequent calculations of combinations (`C(n, r)`) with large parameters are a likely source of performance degradation, especially when `r` approaches `n/2`, where combinations are computationally most expensive."
   - **Reason**: The combination function `C(n, r)` involves factorial calculations, which are costly, particularly when the parameters are large and close to each other.

These invariants capture the key conditions that lead to performance issues in this program, specifically focusing on the interaction between input sizes and the loops as well as the expensive operations performed within those loops.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
As a German University in Cairo (GUC) student and a basketball player, Herr Wafa was delighted once he heard the news. GUC is finally participating in the Annual Basketball Competition (ABC).

assistant: ### Phase 3: Implement the Natural Language Invariants in C++

Below are the checker functions based on the performance-characterizing invariants derived in Phase 2.

#### Checker for High Combination Count

```cpp
// Checker for high combination count
void check_high_combination_count(int s_h, int n) {
    if (s_h >= n - 1) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - High combination count due to large s[h]." << endl;

    }
}
```

        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - Loop executes excessively due to large s[h]." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - Expensive combination calculations due to large s[h]." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrate the Checkers into the Original C++ Program

Below is the instrumented C++ code with the checkers integrated to detect performance bottlenecks:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Function to calculate combinations
long double C(int n, int r) {
    long double res = 1;
    for (int i = 1; i <= r; i++) res /= i;
    for (int i = n - r + 1; i <= n; i++) res *= i;
    return res;
}

// Checker functions for performance invariants
void check_high_combination_count(int s_h, int n) {
    if (s_h >= n - 1) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - High combination count due to large s[h]." << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

}

void check_combination_function_complexity(int s_h, int n) {
    if (s_h > n * 0.75) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - Expensive combination calculations due to large s[h]." << endl;

    }

    // Run performance checkers after reading input

    check_combination_function_complexity(s[h], n);

    if (sum < n)
        cout << -1;
    else {
        cout << setprecision(7);

### Explanation

- **Check Placement**: The checks are placed immediately after input reading to ensure that the conditions are evaluated before any expensive processing begins. This prevents unnecessary execution of the expensive loops and combination calculations if the conditions are already met.
- **Thresholds**: The thresholds in the checks (`s_h >= n - 1`, `s_h > n / 2`, `s_h > n * 0.75`) are chosen based on the analysis to ensure they're sensitive to conditions that could cause performance issues. This should provide a robust mechanism for detecting potential slowdowns.
