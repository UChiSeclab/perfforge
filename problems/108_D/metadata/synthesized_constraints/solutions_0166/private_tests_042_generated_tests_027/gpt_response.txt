### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Line 21**: This loop runs significantly more times for the slow input (`100` times) compared to the fast input (`1` time). This loop's iterations are determined by `s[h]`, which is `100` in the slow input scenario and `1` in the fast input scenario.

2. **Lines 24-50**: These lines involve multiple nested operations within loops that are dependent on `s[h]` and `n`. The loops and vector operations inside them (lines 24-40 and 45-50) are heavily executed in the slow input but not at all in the fast input. This indicates performance degradation related to the size of these vectors and the number of operations performed on them.

3. **Lines 42-44**: Sorting operations on `q1` and `q2` vectors are also executed `99` times in the slow input and not at all in the fast input. This suggests that sorting these vectors is another potential performance bottleneck.

### Phase 2: Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **Invariant: Large `s[h]` Leads to High Iteration Count**

   - **Description**: "If the number of basketball players in Herr Wafa's department (`s[h]`) is very high, approaching the team size `n`, the computation becomes expensive due to increased iterations and vector operations."
   
   - **Explanation**: When `s[h]` is large, the loop on line 21 runs many times, leading to numerous vector operations and calculations, which significantly increase execution time.

2. **Invariant: Extensive Sorting and Vector Operations**

   - **Description**: "If there are numerous players in Herr Wafa's department relative to the team size, and vector operations (involving sorting and large iterations) are frequent, the execution time may increase due to the overhead of sorting and manipulating large vectors."

   - **Explanation**: The operations from lines 24-50 become expensive as the size and frequency of vector operations increase, especially when sorting operations are repeatedly performed on large vectors.

3. **Invariant: Conditional Branching and Nested Loop Inefficiencies**

   - **Description**: "When the number of players from Herr Wafa's department is nearly equal to the total number of players needed minus one, the conditional structures and nested loop operations can lead to inefficient computation due to high branching and loop execution."

   - **Explanation**: The conditions and loops that execute many times due to similar values of `s[h]` and `n` contribute to increased computational cost, especially in the context of conditional vector operations and branching.

By identifying these invariants, we understand that the program's slow execution is primarily triggered by large `s[h]` values in relation to `n`, which leads to excessive iterations and operations on vectors, including sorting. Reducing the number of operations or optimizing these operations could alleviate the slowdown.

### Phase 3: Implementing Natural Language Invariants as C++ Checkers

Here are the C++ checkers for the previously derived invariants:

1. **Invariant: Large `s[h]` Leads to High Iteration Count**
   
   ```cpp
   void check_large_sh_invariant(int sh, int n) {
       if (sh >= n) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large s[h] relative to n!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Invariant: Extensive Sorting and Vector Operations**

   ```cpp
   void check_sort_operations_invariant(int sh, int n) {
       if (sh > n / 2) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive vector and sorting operations!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Invariant: Conditional Branching and Nested Loop Inefficiencies**

   ```cpp
   void check_conditional_branching_invariant(int sh, int n) {
       if (sh >= n - 1) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high branching in nested loops!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Integrating Checkers into the Original Program

Here is the instrumented C++ program with the integrated checkers:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
const int max_n = 1111, inf = 1111111111;
int sum, n, m, h, s[max_n];

// Checker functions for performance bottlenecks
void check_large_sh_invariant(int sh, int n) {
    if (sh >= n) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large s[h] relative to n!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_sort_operations_invariant(int sh, int n) {
    if (sh > n / 2) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive vector and sorting operations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_conditional_branching_invariant(int sh, int n) {
    if (sh >= n - 1) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high branching in nested loops!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    cin >> n >> m >> h;
    --h;
    --n;
    for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
        cin >> s[i];
        if (i == h) {
            --s[i];
        }
        sum += s[i];
    }
    if (sum < n) {
        cout << -1 << endl;
        return 0;
    }

    // Perform checks after input and setup
    check_large_sh_invariant(s[h], n);
    check_sort_operations_invariant(s[h], n);
    check_conditional_branching_invariant(s[h], n);

    double ans = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= s[h] && i <= n; ++i) {
        double v = 1;
        vector<int> q1, q2;
        for (int j = 2; j <= s[h]; ++j) {
            q1.push_back(j);
        }
        for (int j = n - i + 1; j <= n; ++j) {
            q1.push_back(j);
        }
        for (int j = sum - n - s[h] + i + 1; j <= sum - n; ++j) {
            q1.push_back(j);
        }
        for (int j = 2; j <= i; ++j) {
            q2.push_back(j);
        }
        for (int j = 2; j <= s[h] - i; ++j) {
            q2.push_back(j);
        }
        for (int j = sum - s[h] + 1; j <= sum; ++j) {
            q2.push_back(j);
        }
        sort(q1.begin(), q1.end());
        sort(q2.begin(), q2.end());
        reverse(q2.begin(), q2.end());
        for (int j = 0; j < max(q1.size(), q2.size()); ++j) {
            if (j < q1.size()) {
                v *= q1[j];
            }
            if (j < q2.size()) {
                v /= q2[j];
            }
        }
        ans += v;
    }
    printf("%.10f\n", ans);
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

- **Checker Placement**: The checkers are placed after reading inputs and modifying `s[h]`, ensuring that the checks accurately reflect the configurations that could lead to bottlenecks without adding overhead in the main computation loop.
- **Checker Functionality**: Each checker function uses conditions derived from the natural language invariants to identify potential performance bottlenecks, issuing a warning and aborting if such a condition is detected. This provides a mechanism for detecting problematic configurations during execution.
