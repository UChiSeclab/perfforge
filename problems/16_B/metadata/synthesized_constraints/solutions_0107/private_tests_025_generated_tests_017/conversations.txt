system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

A burglar got into a matches warehouse and wants to steal as many matches as possible. In the warehouse there are m containers, in the i-th container there are ai matchboxes, and each matchbox contains bi matches. All the matchboxes are of the same size. The burglar's rucksack can hold n matchboxes exactly. Your task is to find out the maximum amount of matches that a burglar can carry away. He has no time to rearrange matches in the matchboxes, that's why he just chooses not more than n matchboxes so that the total amount of matches in them is maximal.

Input

The first line of the input contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·108) and integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 20). The i + 1-th line contains a pair of numbers ai and bi (1 ≤ ai ≤ 108, 1 ≤ bi ≤ 10). All the input numbers are integer.

Output

Output the only number — answer to the problem.

assistant: ### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

Upon analyzing the hit counts from the slow and fast inputs, the following observations are made:

1. **Line 19 (`while` loop):** This line is executed 111,823,020 times in the slow input, compared to just 2 times in the fast input. This indicates that the `while` loop is the primary bottleneck for the slow input.
2. **Line 20 (`ans += b[i];`):** This line is executed 111,823,018 times in the slow input, compared to 1 time in the fast input. Since this line is within the `while` loop, it confirms that the loop's execution frequency directly impacts this line.
3. **Line 18 (`for` loop):** This line is executed 3 times in the slow input and 2 times in the fast input. The additional iteration suggests that the loop conditions are met more frequently due to the input characteristics.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the analysis, the following performance-characterizing invariants are proposed:

1. **High Iteration Count in Nested Loops:**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "When the number of matchboxes that can be chosen (`n`) is very large, and there are containers with high numbers of matchboxes and matches per box, the nested loops may lead to excessive iteration counts, causing significant slowdowns."
   - **Explanation:** The combination of a large `n` and high `a[i]` values can result in a high number of iterations in the `while` loop, especially when `b[i]` values are also high, maximizing the number of matches collected.

2. **Inefficient Loop Execution Due to Large `n`:**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "If `n` approaches its upper limit (e.g., close to 2 × 10^8) while containers hold many matches, the loop responsible for accumulating matches (`while` loop) may execute excessively, leading to performance issues."
   - **Explanation:** A large `n` allows for many iterations as it decreases with each matchbox chosen, especially when containers have a large number of matchboxes (`a[i]` values).

3. **Excessive Resource Consumption in Accumulating Matches:**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "When containers have a large number of matchboxes with high matches per box (`b[i]`), the program may spend a disproportionate amount of time accumulating matches if `n` permits the selection of many matchboxes, thus slowing down execution."
   - **Explanation:** The outer and inner loops are heavily influenced by the combination of `a[i]` and `b[i]`, leading to frequent execution of the inner loop when matches per box are maximized.

These invariants are designed to capture the conditions under which the program slows down significantly, while adhering to the problem constraints and avoiding reliance on specific input values.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
A burglar got into a matches warehouse and wants to steal as many matches as possible. In the warehouse there are m containers, in the i-th container there are ai matchboxes, and each matchbox contains bi matches. All the matchboxes are of the same size. The burglar's rucksack can hold n matchboxes exactly. Your task is to find out the maximum amount of matches that a burglar can carry away. He has no time to rearrange matches in the matchboxes, that's why he just chooses not more than n matchboxes so that the total amount of matches in them is maximal.

Input

The first line of the input contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·108) and integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 20). The i + 1-th line contains a pair of numbers ai and bi (1 ≤ ai ≤ 108, 1 ≤ bi ≤ 10). All the input numbers are integer.

Solution (C++ code):
{solution}


assistant: Let's implement the performance-characterizing invariants as runtime checks in C++, and then integrate them into the original C++ program.

### Phase 3: Implement the Natural Language Invariants in C++

1. **High Iteration Count in Nested Loops:**
    - This invariant checks if `n` is large and containers have many matchboxes and high matches per box, potentially leading to too many loop iterations.

```cpp
void check_high_iteration_invariant(int n, int a[], int b[], int m) {
    int maxMatchesPerBox = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
        if (b[i] > maxMatchesPerBox) {
            maxMatchesPerBox = b[i];
        }
    }
    if (n > 1e8 && maxMatchesPerBox >= 9) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to high iteration count!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

2. **Inefficient Loop Execution Due to Large `n`:**
    - This invariant checks if `n` is close to its upper limit combined with large `a[i]` values, potentially causing excessive loop executions.

```cpp
void check_inefficient_loop_execution(int n, int a[], int m) {
    int totalMatchboxes = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
        totalMatchboxes += a[i];
    }
    if (n > 1e8 && totalMatchboxes > 1e8) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to inefficient loop execution!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

3. **Excessive Resource Consumption in Accumulating Matches:**
    - This invariant checks if high `b[i]` values lead to inefficient matches accumulation.

```cpp
void check_excessive_resource_consumption(int b[], int m) {
    int highMatchCount = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
        if (b[i] > 8) {
            ++highMatchCount;
        }
    }
    if (highMatchCount == m) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to excessive resource consumption!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrate Checker Code into the Original Program

Here's the instrumented C++ code with the checkers integrated:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int n, m, ans, c[10];

// Checker functions
void check_high_iteration_invariant(int n, int a[], int b[], int m) {
    int maxMatchesPerBox = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
        if (b[i] > maxMatchesPerBox) {
            maxMatchesPerBox = b[i];
        }
    }
    if (n > 1e8 && maxMatchesPerBox >= 9) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to high iteration count!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_inefficient_loop_execution(int n, int a[], int m) {
    int totalMatchboxes = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
        totalMatchboxes += a[i];
    }
    if (n > 1e8 && totalMatchboxes > 1e8) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to inefficient loop execution!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_excessive_resource_consumption(int b[], int m) {
    int highMatchCount = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
        if (b[i] > 8) {
            ++highMatchCount;
        }
    }
    if (highMatchCount == m) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to excessive resource consumption!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
    cin.tie(0);
    cin >> n >> m;
    int a[m], b[m];

    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        cin >> a[i] >> b[i];
        if (c[b[i] - 1] == 0) {
            c[b[i] - 1] = i + 1;
        } else {
            a[c[b[i] - 1] - 1] += a[i];
        }
    }

    // Performance checkers to detect bottleneck scenarios
    check_high_iteration_invariant(n, a, b, m);
    check_inefficient_loop_execution(n, a, m);
    check_excessive_resource_consumption(b, m);

    sort(b, b + m, greater<int>());
    for (int i = 0; i < m && b[i] && n > 0; i++) {
        while (a[c[b[i] - 1] - 1]-- > 0 && n-- > 0) {
            ans += b[i];
        }
    }
    cout << ans;
}
```

**Comments:**
- **`check_high_iteration_invariant`** is placed after the input is fully read to check for potential excessive iterations.
- **`check_inefficient_loop_execution`** is added to identify scenarios where `n` and the total matchboxes may lead to inefficiencies.
- **`check_excessive_resource_consumption`** ensures that high match values do not cause excessive execution.

These checks help to detect performance bottlenecks according to the derived invariants, without adding significant overhead in tight loops.
