### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Comparison of Hit Counts:**
   - **`num_stick` Function (Line 14-21):**
     - **Slow Input:** Invoked 1144 times.
     - **Fast Input:** Invoked 100 times.
   - **Inner Loops (Line 30-39 and Line 43-52):**
     - The nested loop on line 30-39 is hit significantly more often with the slow input.
     - The loop on Line 43-52 is only executed for the slow input.

2. **Pinpointing Inefficiencies:**
   - The `num_stick` function is a key contributor to the slowdown. This function is responsible for calculating the number of sticks needed to form a valid number from the current configuration. It is called once for each digit and each possible number (0-9) within nested loops, leading to a high invocation count.
   - The loops in lines 30-39 are executed more frequently due to a lack of early exits or pruning conditions, resulting in redundant computations when the input is not pruned effectively or when k is high relative to n.

3. **Data Structure Interaction:**
   - The `exist` array is used to track possible configurations using dynamic programming across digits and segment allowances. The slow input results in many updates and checks in this DP table, indicating a potentially large search space when k is high.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **Invariant 1: High `k` Relative to `n`:**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "When the number of segments `k` that need to be reactivated is high relative to the number of digits `n`, the program may explore a large search space, leading to slow execution. This is particularly true when `k` approaches the total possible segment variations for `n` digits."
   
2. **Invariant 2: Inefficient Exploration:**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "If the dynamic programming approach involves many redundant checks or updates, especially in the absence of effective pruning, it results in excessive computations. This happens when the input configuration allows for many possible segment activations without early resolution."
   
3. **Invariant 3: Extensive Possible Combinations:**
   - **Natural Language Description:** "When the initial configuration of segments allows for many possible higher numbers with small segment activations, the complexity increases significantly because more combinations are evaluated. This can be seen when the input digits are close to forming large numbers but require adjustments."

These invariants focus on the conditions under which the dynamic programming and combinatorial evaluation become extensive due to the combinations of `n` and `k`, leading to a slowdown. The invariants also emphasize the need for pruning conditions or more efficient exploration strategies in the DP formulation.

### Phase 3: Implement the Natural Language Invariants in C++

Here is the C++ code implementing the performance-characterizing invariants as runtime checks based on the natural language descriptions from Phase 2:

```cpp
void check_high_k_relative_to_n(int n, int k) {
    // If k is close to n * 7 (maximum possible segments to be turned on for n digits)
    if (k > n * 5) { // Assuming 5 as a reasonable threshold for a "high" relative value
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to high k relative to n!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_inefficient_exploration(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to inefficient exploration!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_extensive_possible_combinations(int n, int k) {
    // If k allows for many combinations without early resolution
    if (k > n * 3 && k < n * 5) { // Suppose these thresholds balance between exploration and resolution
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to extensive possible combinations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrate the Checkers into the Original Program

Now, let's integrate these checks into the given C++ program at appropriate points:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

const double PI = acos(-1);
const int mod = 1e9 + 7;
const long long N = 1e4 + 5, K = 105;
const long long oo = 1e18 + 5;
const int si = (1 << 20);
const int INF = (1 << 30);
const long long M = 1e3 + 5;
const double INFdb = 1e10;
vector<string> nums = {"1110111", "0010010", "1011101", "1011011", "0111010",
                       "1101011", "1101111", "1010010", "1111111", "1111011"};
bool exist[2005][2005];

int num_stick(string s, int num) {
    int ans = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < 7; ++i) {
        if (nums[num][i] == '0' && s[i] == '1') return INF;
        if (nums[num][i] != s[i]) ++ans;
    }
    return ans;
}

void check_high_k_relative_to_n(int n, int k) {
    if (k > n * 5) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to high k relative to n!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_inefficient_exploration(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to inefficient exploration!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_extensive_possible_combinations(int n, int k) {
    if (k > n * 3 && k < n * 5) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to extensive possible combinations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);

    int n, k;
    cin >> n >> k;
    vector<string> s(n + 1);
    
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) cin >> s[i];

    // Check for high 'k' relative to 'n'
    check_high_k_relative_to_n(n, k);

    exist[n + 1][0] = 1;
    for (int i = n; i >= 1; --i) {
        for (int j = 0; j <= k; ++j) {
            for (int num = 0; num < 10; ++num) {
                int cost = num_stick(s[i], num);
                if (cost <= j) {
                    exist[i][j] |= exist[i + 1][j - cost];
                }
            }
        }
    }

    // Check for inefficient exploration before solution exploration
    check_inefficient_exploration(!exist[1][k]);

    if (!exist[1][k]) return cout << -1, 0;

    // Check for extensive possible combinations
    check_extensive_possible_combinations(n, k);

    string ans = "";
    int remain = k;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        for (int num = 9; num >= 0; --num) {
            int cost = num_stick(s[i], num);
            if (cost <= remain && exist[i + 1][remain - cost]) {
                ans += (char)(num + '0');
                remain -= cost;
                break;
            }
        }
    }
    
    cout << ans;
    cerr << "\nTime elapsed: " << 1000 * clock() / CLOCKS_PER_SEC << "ms\n";
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of Integration
- **`check_high_k_relative_to_n`:** Added after reading inputs `n` and `k` to immediately catch if the input values might cause performance degradation due to high k relative to n.
- **`check_inefficient_exploration`:** Used before exploring the solution to ensure we optimize exploration paths.
- **`check_extensive_possible_combinations`:** Placed after confirming a solution path exists to ensure further computations are efficient given the constraints. 

These checks aim to efficiently identify potential bottlenecks without adding overhead in the performance-critical part of the loops or function calls.
