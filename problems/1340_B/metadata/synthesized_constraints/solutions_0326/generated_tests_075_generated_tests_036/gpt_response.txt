### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Comparison of Hit Counts**:
    - The `calc` function (lines 10-22) shows a significant difference in hit counts between the slow and fast inputs, with line 12 being especially high in hit counts for the slow input.
    - The nested loops in the `main` function (lines 34-42), particularly lines 35 and 36, exhibit a much higher hit count on the slow input compared to the fast input. This suggests that a large amount of processing is being done repeatedly on the slow input.

2. **Identifying Likely Causes**:
    - The `calc` function is a key part of the program, responsible for calculating the number of additional segments needed to form a particular digit. It is called frequently due to its placement in the loop that iterates over all digits (line 30).
    - The double- and triple-nested loops in the `main` function iterate over a large range (up to 2000 for `j`), which results in a very high number of iterations, especially when combined with the loop iterating over all digits.
    - The dynamic programming (DP) table `dp` is being updated for a large range of values. This suggests the DP approach is computationally intensive given the input size constraints.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **Natural Language Invariants**:

    - **Invariant 1**: "If the number of digits `n` on the scoreboard is large, combined with a high number of segments `k` that need to be enabled (close to the constraint limits like `n = 2000` and `k = 2000`), the number of potential combinations in the dynamic programming approach increases significantly, leading to slow computation."
    
    - **Invariant 2**: "If the digit configurations require many transformations (i.e., the `calc` function frequently returns high counts of additional segments needed), the program will execute the nested loops more times, especially when the possible transformations span many configurations (like transforming all digits from '0' to '9')."

    - **Invariant 3**: "If each digit's current segment configuration is very different from the possible configurations of other digits, causing high operations in `calc`, the program may slow down significantly due to repeated calculations in the nested loops."

    - **Invariant 4**: "When the dynamic programming table (`dp`) must be filled for a large number of possible 'on' segment combinations (close to or equal to the constraints of `k`), the number of operations grows, leading to increased execution time."

2. **Condition Correlation**:
    - These conditions are strongly connected with how the existing segment configuration requires transformation into a valid digit while enabling exactly `k` segments. If `n` and `k` values are near their maximum, the space that needs exploration by the DP solution grows exponentially.
    - The configuration of each digit's segments is crucial; if they differ significantly from those needed to form a valid digit, the number of operations in the `calc` function and the DP table updates will increase.

By focusing on these invariants, you can anticipate and diagnose potential slowdowns when the program is given inputs that push the input constraints to their limits, or configurations that maximize the computational effort required by the current algorithmic structure.

### Phase 3: Implement Runtime Checkers in C++

Based on the performance-characterizing invariants inferred earlier, we will implement C++ code snippets to check these conditions at runtime.

#### Invariant 1 Code:
This checks if `n` and `k` are large, which can lead to increased computational effort due to the large state space.

```cpp
void check_large_n_k_invariant(int n, int k) {
    if (n >= 1800 && k >= 1800) {  // Slightly relaxed from constraint max to trigger slowdown condition
        cerr << "Warning: Large n and k values - potential performance bottleneck!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

#### Invariant 2 Code:
This checks if the `calc` function is called frequently with high return values, indicating many transformations.

```cpp
void check_calc_frequency_invariant(int callCount, int threshold) {
    if (callCount > threshold) {
        cerr << "Warning: calc function called too many times - potential performance bottleneck!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

#### Invariant 3 Code:
This checks the number of operations in `calc`, especially when transforming each digit configuration.

```cpp
void check_digit_transformation_invariant(int operations) {
    if (operations > 10) {  // Arbitrary threshold indicating excessive transformations
        cerr << "Warning: Excessive digit transformations in calc function!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

#### Invariant 4 Code:
This checks if the dynamic programming table `dp` covers too many states, increasing computational load.

```cpp
void check_dp_state_invariant(int dpSize, int threshold) {
    if (dpSize > threshold) {
        cerr << "Warning: Dynamic programming state space too large!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrate Checkers into the Program

Now, we will integrate these checkers into the original C++ code by placing them at strategic points in the program.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
const int maxn = 4e5 + 100;
int dist[2006][15], ans[2005];
vector<int> v[2005];
int dp[2006][2005], pre[2005][2006], num[2005][2005];
char arr[2005][15];
char str[15][15] = {"1110111", "0010010", "1011101", "1011011", "0111010",
                    "1101011", "1101111", "1010010", "1111111", "1111011"};

void check_large_n_k_invariant(int n, int k) {
    if (n >= 1800 && k >= 1800) {
        cerr << "Warning: Large n and k values - potential performance bottleneck!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_calc_frequency_invariant(int callCount, int threshold) {
    if (callCount > threshold) {
        cerr << "Warning: calc function called too many times - potential performance bottleneck!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_digit_transformation_invariant(int operations) {
    if (operations > 10) {
        cerr << "Warning: Excessive digit transformations in calc function!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_dp_state_invariant(int dpSize, int threshold) {
    if (dpSize > threshold) {
        cerr << "Warning: Dynamic programming state space too large!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int calc(char a[], char b[]) {
    int ret = 0;
    int operations = 0;  // Track operations for invariant check
    for (int i = 0; i < 7; i++) {
        if (a[i] == '0' && b[i] == '1')
            ret++;
        else if (a[i] == b[i])
            ;
        else {
            ret = 0x3f3f3f3f;
            break;
        }
        operations++;  // Count operations
    }
    check_digit_transformation_invariant(operations);  // Check after transformation
    return ret;
}

int main() {
    int n, k;
    scanf("%d%d", &n, &k);
    
    check_large_n_k_invariant(n, k);  // Check after input

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) scanf("%s", arr[i]);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        int now = 0x3f3f3f3f;
        for (int j = 0; j <= 9; j++) {
            dist[i][j] = calc(arr[i], str[j]);
        }
    }
    
    int calcCallCount = n * 10;  // Number of times calc is called
    check_calc_frequency_invariant(calcCallCount, 5000);  // Example threshold

    memset(pre, -1, sizeof(pre));
    dp[n][0] = 1;
    for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        for (int j = 2000; j >= 0; j--) {
            for (int k = 0; k <= 9; k++) {
                if (j - dist[i][k] >= 0 && dp[i + 1][j - dist[i][k]]) {
                    dp[i][j] = 1, pre[i][j] = j - dist[i][k], num[i][j] = k;
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    check_dp_state_invariant(n * 2000, 1000000);  // Example threshold

    if (dp[0][k]) {
        int tot = 0;
        int nowa = 0, nowb = k;
        while (nowa < n) {
            ans[++tot] = num[nowa][nowb];
            nowb = pre[nowa][nowb];
            nowa++;
        }
        for (int i = 1; i <= tot; i++) printf("%d", ans[i]);
        printf("\n");
    } else
        printf("-1\n");
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

- **Invariant Check Placement**:
  - **`check_large_n_k_invariant`**: Added after reading `n` and `k` to immediately detect potential issues with large values.
  - **`check_calc_frequency_invariant`**: Checked after the loop that computes `dist`, ensuring that `calc` is not called excessively.
  - **`check_digit_transformation_invariant`**: Placed inside the `calc` function to monitor transformation operations.
  - **`check_dp_state_invariant`**: Added after the main DP loop to ensure the state space does not become excessively large.

These checks help monitor conditions that could lead to performance degradation, allowing for early detection of bottlenecks.
