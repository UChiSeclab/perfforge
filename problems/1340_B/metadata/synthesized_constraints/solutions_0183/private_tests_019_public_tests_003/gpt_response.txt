### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

Based on the provided hit counts for the slow and fast inputs, the following observations can be made:

1. **High hit count in `reachable` function (lines 6-15):** 
   - The `reachable` function has a disproportionately higher hit count on the slow input (766 calls) compared to the fast input (2 calls). This indicates that this function is a significant contributor to the slowdown.

2. **High hit count in the `doable` function (lines 18-32):** 
   - The recursive `doable` function also has a high hit count (315 calls on the first line). This function is likely being called repeatedly in a nested or recursive manner, which is often a source of inefficiency.

3. **Loop inefficiencies:**
   - Particularly in the `doable` function, the loop iterating over digits (lines 23-28) is executed 748 times for the slow input, while the `reachable` function inside it is called 680 times. This suggests that the loop is exploring many branches, possibly leading to a combinatorial explosion in certain scenarios.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Given the analysis above, the slowdown can be described by the following invariants:

1. **Recursive Exploration:**
   - "When the number of digits `n` is large and the number of segments `k` that can be turned on is close to `n`, the recursive exploration in the `doable` function can become extensive, as many combinations of segment activations need to be evaluated."

2. **Segment Reaching Checks:**
   - "If the function `reachable` is called frequently due to many combinations of digits that need to be checked, the performance could degrade significantly, especially if the digits have many non-glowing segments."

3. **High Branching Factor:**
   - "A high branching factor in the `doable` function's loop, caused by a high number of feasible digit conversions per scoreboard position, can lead to excessive recursive calls, slowing down the program."

4. **Combinatorial Problem Size:**
   - "When `n` is large and `k` is such that many combinations of digit transformations are possible (e.g., `k` is midway to the maximum possible segment activations), the problem size can grow combinatorially, leading to potential slowdowns."

These invariants suggest that the primary cause of slow performance lies in recursive calls and evaluations of many potential segment activations, especially when the input size and allowed activations create a large search space.

### Phase 3: Implementing Natural Language Invariants as C++ Checks

Below are the C++ code snippets implementing the previously derived natural language performance-characterizing invariants.

1. **Recursive Exploration Invariant Check:**

```cpp
void check_recursive_exploration(int n, int k) {
    // Warning if recursion can explore a large space due to large n and k
    if (n > 1500 && k > 1500) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck triggered - recursive exploration may be extensive!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

2. **Segment Reaching Checks Invariant:**

```cpp
void check_segment_reaching(int reachableCalls) {
    // Warning if the reachable function is called excessively
    if (reachableCalls > 10000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck triggered - excessive calls to reachable function!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

3. **High Branching Factor Invariant:**

```cpp
void check_branching_factor(int branchingEstimate) {
    // Warning if a high branching factor is observed
    if (branchingEstimate > 1000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck triggered - high branching factor in recursion!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

4. **Combinatorial Problem Size Invariant:**

```cpp
void check_combinatorial_size(int n, int k) {
    // Warning if the problem size suggests a combinatorial explosion
    if (n > 1000 && k > n / 2) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck triggered - potential combinatorial problem size!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrating Checks into Original C++ Code

Here's how the checks are integrated into the original program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

vector<string> lista;
vector<string> pingo = {"1110111", "0010010", "1011101", "1011011", "0111010",
                        "1101011", "1101111", "1010010", "1111111", "1111011"};
int dp[2005][2005];

// Check for recursive exploration
void check_recursive_exploration(int n, int k) {
    if (n > 1500 && k > 1500) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck triggered - recursive exploration may be extensive!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Check for excessive calls to the reachable function
void check_segment_reaching(int reachableCalls) {
    if (reachableCalls > 10000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck triggered - excessive calls to reachable function!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Check for high branching factor in recursion
void check_branching_factor(int branchingEstimate) {
    if (branchingEstimate > 1000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck triggered - high branching factor in recursion!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Check for potential combinatorial problem size
void check_combinatorial_size(int n, int k) {
    if (n > 1000 && k > n / 2) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck triggered - potential combinatorial problem size!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int reachable(string s, int j) {
    string target = pingo[j];
    int ans = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < 7; i++) {
        if (target[i] == '0' && s[i] == '1')
            return -1;
        else if (target[i] == '1' && s[i] == '0')
            ans++;
    }
    return ans;
}

bool doable(int pos, int k) {
    if (dp[pos][k] != -1)
        return dp[pos][k];
    else {
        bool ans = false;
        for (int j = 0; j <= 9; j++) {
            int val = reachable(lista[pos], j);
            if (val >= 0 && val <= k) {
                ans = ans || doable(pos + 1, k - val);
            }
        }
        dp[pos][k] = ans;
        return ans;
    }
}

int main() {
    memset(dp, -1, sizeof(dp));
    int n, kk;
    scanf("%d %d", &n, &kk);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        string s;
        cin >> s;
        lista.push_back(s);
    }
    
    // Position checkers at the setup phase
    check_recursive_exploration(n, kk);
    check_combinatorial_size(n, kk);

    dp[n][0] = 1;
    for (int i = 1; i < 2005; i++) {
        dp[n][i] = 0;
    }

    string ans;
    int reachableCalls = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        string s = lista[i];
        int branchingFactor = 0;
        for (int j = 9; j >= 0; j--) {
            int val = reachable(s, j);
            reachableCalls++;
            if (val >= 0 && val <= kk && doable(i + 1, kk - val) != 0) {
                kk -= val;
                ans.push_back('0' + j);
                branchingFactor++;
                break;
            }
        }
        
        // Check for excessive branching within each digit
        check_branching_factor(branchingFactor);
    }

    // Final check for excessive calls
    check_segment_reaching(reachableCalls);

    if (ans.size() != n)
        puts("-1");
    else
        cout << ans << '\n';
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of Integration

1. **Placement of Checks:** The checks are placed strategically at points that don't degrade performance significantly:
   - **Recursive Exploration and Combinatorial Size:** Checked after input to ensure the setup is not already in a problematic state.
   - **Branching Factor:** Checked inside the outer loop to catch conditions that may cause excessive branching.
   - **Reachable Calls:** Checked at the end to catch if the `reachable` function was called excessively throughout execution.
   
2. **Helper Functions:** Each check is encapsulated in its own helper function for clarity and reusability, preventing code clutter in the main logic. This also modularizes the code, making it easier to maintain and extend.

These additions will help developers or automated testing tools (like fuzzers) identify potential performance bottlenecks during development and testing phases, enhancing the robustness of the solution.
