system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

Denis, after buying flowers and sweets (you will learn about this story in the next task), went to a date with Nastya to ask her to become a couple. Now, they are sitting in the cafe and finally... Denis asks her to be together, but ... Nastya doesn't give any answer. 

The poor boy was very upset because of that. He was so sad that he punched some kind of scoreboard with numbers. The numbers are displayed in the same way as on an electronic clock: each digit position consists of 7 segments, which can be turned on or off to display different numbers. The picture shows how all 10 decimal digits are displayed: 

<image>

After the punch, some segments stopped working, that is, some segments might stop glowing if they glowed earlier. But Denis remembered how many sticks were glowing and how many are glowing now. Denis broke exactly k segments and he knows which sticks are working now. Denis came up with the question: what is the maximum possible number that can appear on the board if you turn on exactly k sticks (which are off now)? 

It is allowed that the number includes leading zeros.

Input

The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000) — the number of digits on scoreboard and k (0 ≤ k ≤ 2000) — the number of segments that stopped working.

The next n lines contain one binary string of length 7, the i-th of which encodes the i-th digit of the scoreboard.

Each digit on the scoreboard consists of 7 segments. We number them, as in the picture below, and let the i-th place of the binary string be 0 if the i-th stick is not glowing and 1 if it is glowing. Then a binary string of length 7 will specify which segments are glowing now.

<image>

Thus, the sequences "1110111", "0010010", "1011101", "1011011", "0111010", "1101011", "1101111", "1010010", "1111111", "1111011" encode in sequence all digits from 0 to 9 inclusive.

Output

Output a single number consisting of n digits — the maximum number that can be obtained if you turn on exactly k sticks or -1, if it is impossible to turn on exactly k sticks so that a correct number appears on the scoreboard digits.

Note

In the first test, we are obliged to include all 7 sticks and get one 8 digit on the scoreboard.

In the second test, we have sticks turned on so that units are formed. For 5 of additionally included sticks, you can get the numbers 07, 18, 34, 43, 70, 79, 81 and 97, of which we choose the maximum — 97.

In the third test, it is impossible to turn on exactly 5 sticks so that a sequence of numbers appears on the scoreboard.

assistant: To analyze the performance bottlenecks in the given C program, we'll follow the two-phase approach outlined in the task description:

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Compare Line-Level Hit Counts**: 
   - The line-level hit counts show a significant difference between the slow and fast input runs, particularly in the nested loops within lines 22-38, especially lines 28-32.

2. **Pinpoint Lines with High Hit Counts**:
   - **Lines 24-25 and 28-32**: These lines are inside nested loops that are significantly more executed in the slow input scenario. This indicates a potential inefficiency in how digits are processed and combinations are evaluated.
   - The condition on **line 25** and the inner loop on **line 28** is executed frequently, suggesting that the program spends a lot of time evaluating possible digit configurations and updates to the DP table.

3. **Inference on Data Structures and Logic**:
   - The program uses a dynamic programming approach stored in a `dp` array, with dimensions tied to the number of digits (`n`) and the number of segments (`k`). The presence of nested loops suggests that the complexity could be heavily influenced by these variables.
   - The function of updating `dp`, `pre`, and `segnum` arrays involves a lot of computation for each digit and each possible value of segments, especially when evaluating multiple possible digits for each position (lines 24-32).

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the analysis, the following natural language invariants describe conditions under which the program is likely to enter a slow path:

1. **Complex Combinations of Digits**:
   - "When both `n` and `k` are large, if each digit on the scoreboard potentially matches multiple possible digits (due to the condition checking and updating in nested loops), the complexity of evaluating all combinations increases significantly. This can cause a slowdown as the program evaluates many configurations."

2. **High Number of Active Digits**:
   - "If the number of segments (`k`) to be activated is close to the total number of inactive segments across all digits (`n`), the program might enter a performance bottleneck due to increased combinations and checks needed for possible digit transformations."

3. **Large DP and Pre-Computation Space**:
   - "The performance can degrade when the dynamic programming state space (`dp`, `pre`, `segnum` arrays) is significantly large, corresponding to high values of `n` and `k`, leading to excessive iterations and updates in nested loops."

These invariants highlight potential inefficiencies in the processing of digits and the resulting complexity in the dynamic programming solution. By understanding these conditions, developers can focus on optimizing critical sections or applying strategies to reduce the computational overhead under these scenarios.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
Denis, after buying flowers and sweets (you will learn about this story in the next task), went to a date with Nastya to ask her to become a couple. Now, they are sitting in the cafe and finally... Denis asks her to be together, but ... Nastya doesn't give any answer. 

The poor boy was very upset because of that. He was so sad that he punched some kind of scoreboard with numbers. The numbers are displayed in the same way as on an electronic clock: each digit position consists of 7 segments, which can be turned on or off to display different numbers. The picture shows how all 10 decimal digits are displayed: 

<image>

After the punch, some segments stopped working, that is, some segments might stop glowing if they glowed earlier. But Denis remembered how many sticks were glowing and how many are glowing now. Denis broke exactly k segments and he knows which sticks are working now. Denis came up with the question: what is the maximum possible number that can appear on the board if you turn on exactly k sticks (which are off now)? 

It is allowed that the number includes leading zeros.

Input

The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000) — the number of digits on scoreboard and k (0 ≤ k ≤ 2000) — the number of segments that stopped working.

The next n lines contain one binary string of length 7, the i-th of which encodes the i-th digit of the scoreboard.

Each digit on the scoreboard consists of 7 segments. We number them, as in the picture below, and let the i-th place of the binary string be 0 if the i-th stick is not glowing and 1 if it is glowing. Then a binary string of length 7 will specify which segments are glowing now.

<image>

Thus, the sequences "1110111", "0010010", "1011101", "1011011", "0111010", "1101011", "1101111", "1010010", "1111111", "1111011" encode in sequence all digits from 0 to 9 inclusive.

Output

Output a single number consisting of n digits — the maximum number that can be obtained if you turn on exactly k sticks or -1, if it is impossible to turn on exactly k sticks so that a correct number appears on the scoreboard digits.

Examples

Input


1 7
0000000


Output


8

Input


2 5
0010010
0010010


Output


97

Input


3 5
0100001
1001001
1010011


Output


-1

Note

In the first test, we are obliged to include all 7 sticks and get one 8 digit on the scoreboard.

In the second test, we have sticks turned on so that units are formed. For 5 of additionally included sticks, you can get the numbers 07, 18, 34, 43, 70, 79, 81 and 97, of which we choose the maximum — 97.

In the third test, it is impossible to turn on exactly 5 sticks so that a sequence of numbers appears on the scoreboard.

Solution (C++ code):

assistant: Let's implement Phase 3 by translating the natural language invariants into C++ code snippets that will check these conditions at runtime.

### Phase 3: Implementing Invariants as C++ Checkers

1. **Invariant for Complex Combinations of Digits**:
   - **Natural Language**: "When both `n` and `k` are large, if each digit on the scoreboard potentially matches multiple possible digits (due to the condition checking and updating in nested loops), the complexity of evaluating all combinations increases significantly."
   - **C++ Checker**:
   ```cpp
   void check_combination_invariant(int n, int k) {
       if (n > 1000 && k > 500) { // Large n and k can cause slowdown
           cerr << "Warning: combination_invariant triggered - complex combinations of digits" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Invariant for High Number of Active Digits**:
   - **Natural Language**: "If the number of segments (`k`) to be activated is close to the total number of inactive segments, the program might enter a performance bottleneck due to increased combinations and checks needed for possible digit transformations."
   - **C++ Checker**:
   ```cpp
   void check_active_segments_invariant(int n, int k, const vector<int>& scoreboard) {
       int inactiveSegments = 0;
       for (int score : scoreboard) {
           inactiveSegments += 7 - __builtin_popcount(score);
       }
       if (k > inactiveSegments * 0.8) { // If k is more than 80% of inactive segments
           cerr << "Warning: active_segments_invariant triggered - too many active segments" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Invariant for Large DP and Pre-Computation Space**:
   - **Natural Language**: "The performance can degrade when the dynamic programming state space is significantly large, leading to excessive iterations and updates."
   - **C++ Checker**:
   ```cpp
   void check_dp_space_invariant(int n, int k) {
       if (n * k > 1500000) { // Large DP space threshold
           cerr << "Warning: dp_space_invariant triggered - large DP space" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Integrating Checkers into the Program

Now, let's integrate these checkers into the original C++ program.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int digit_to_int[] = {0b1110111, 0b0010010, 0b1011101, 0b1011011, 0b0111010,
                      0b1101011, 0b1101111, 0b1010010, 0b1111111, 0b1111011};
short dp[2010][2010][10];
short segnum[2010][2010][10];
short pre[2010][2010][10];
int scoreboard[2010];

// Checker functions
void check_combination_invariant(int n, int k) {
    if (n > 1000 && k > 500) { // Large n and k can cause slowdown
        cerr << "Warning: combination_invariant triggered - complex combinations of digits" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_active_segments_invariant(int n, int k, const vector<int>& scoreboard) {
    int inactiveSegments = 0;
    for (int score : scoreboard) {
        inactiveSegments += 7 - __builtin_popcount(score);
    }
    if (k > inactiveSegments * 0.8) { // If k is more than 80% of inactive segments
        cerr << "Warning: active_segments_invariant triggered - too many active segments" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_dp_space_invariant(int n, int k) {
    if (n * k > 1500000) { // Large DP space threshold
        cerr << "Warning: dp_space_invariant triggered - large DP space" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    int n, k;
    scanf("%d%d", &n, &k);
    
    vector<int> scoreboard_vec(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        char t[8];
        scanf("%s", t);
        for (int j = 0; j < 7; j++) {
            scoreboard[i] <<= 1;
            scoreboard[i] |= t[j] - '0';
        }
        scoreboard_vec[i] = scoreboard[i];
    }
    
    // Apply performance checkers after input parsing
    check_combination_invariant(n, k);
    check_active_segments_invariant(n, k, scoreboard_vec);
    check_dp_space_invariant(n, k);

    int cur = 0;
    fill(dp[cur][0], dp[cur][0] + 10, 1);
    for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        fill(&dp[cur ^ 1][0][0], &dp[cur ^ 1][0][0] + 2010 * 10, (short)0);
        for (int d = 0; d <= 9; d++) {
            if ((scoreboard[i] & digit_to_int[d]) == scoreboard[i]) {
                int diff = __builtin_popcount(digit_to_int[d] - scoreboard[i]);
                for (int j = 0; j <= k; j++) {
                    for (int m = 0; m <= 9; m++) {
                        if (dp[cur][j][m]) {
                            dp[cur ^ 1][j + diff][d] = 1;
                            pre[i][j + diff][d] = m;
                            segnum[i][j + diff][d] = diff;
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        cur ^= 1;
    }

    int ans = -1;
    for (int i = 9; i >= 0; i--) {
        if (dp[cur][k][i]) {
            ans = i;
            break;
        }
    }
    if (ans == -1) {
        puts("-1");
        return 0;
    }
    printf("%d", ans);
    int seg = k;
    for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
        int c = pre[i][seg][ans];
        int s = segnum[i][seg][ans];
        ans = c;
        seg -= s;
        printf("%d", ans);
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of Inserted Checks
- **`check_combination_invariant`**: This checks if the combination of `n` and `k` is large enough to potentially cause a slowdown due to the complexity of evaluating many possible digit transformations.
- **`check_active_segments_invariant`**: This checks if `k` is a significant portion of the total inactive segments, which could indicate extensive computation in attempting to find all possible digit transformations.
- **`check_dp_space_invariant`**: Ensures that the product of `n` and `k` does not exceed a threshold that would suggest an excessively large dynamic programming state space. 

These checks are placed right after input parsing to detect potential slowdowns before entering the main computation phase.
