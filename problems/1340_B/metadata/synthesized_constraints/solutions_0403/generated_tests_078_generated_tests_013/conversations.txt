system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

Denis, after buying flowers and sweets (you will learn about this story in the next task), went to a date with Nastya to ask her to become a couple. Now, they are sitting in the cafe and finally... Denis asks her to be together, but ... Nastya doesn't give any answer. 

The poor boy was very upset because of that. He was so sad that he punched some kind of scoreboard with numbers. The numbers are displayed in the same way as on an electronic clock: each digit position consists of 7 segments, which can be turned on or off to display different numbers. The picture shows how all 10 decimal digits are displayed: 

<image>

After the punch, some segments stopped working, that is, some segments might stop glowing if they glowed earlier. But Denis remembered how many sticks were glowing and how many are glowing now. Denis broke exactly k segments and he knows which sticks are working now. Denis came up with the question: what is the maximum possible number that can appear on the board if you turn on exactly k sticks (which are off now)? 

It is allowed that the number includes leading zeros.

Input

The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000) — the number of digits on scoreboard and k (0 ≤ k ≤ 2000) — the number of segments that stopped working.

The next n lines contain one binary string of length 7, the i-th of which encodes the i-th digit of the scoreboard.

Each digit on the scoreboard consists of 7 segments. We number them, as in the picture below, and let the i-th place of the binary string be 0 if the i-th stick is not glowing and 1 if it is glowing. Then a binary string of length 7 will specify which segments are glowing now.

<image>

Thus, the sequences "1110111", "0010010", "1011101", "1011011", "0111010", "1101011", "1101111", "1010010", "1111111", "1111011" encode in sequence all digits from 0 to 9 inclusive.

Output

Output a single number consisting of n digits — the maximum number that can be obtained if you turn on exactly k sticks or -1, if it is impossible to turn on exactly k sticks so that a correct number appears on the scoreboard digits.

Note

In the first test, we are obliged to include all 7 sticks and get one 8 digit on the scoreboard.

In the second test, we have sticks turned on so that units are formed. For 5 of additionally included sticks, you can get the numbers 07, 18, 34, 43, 70, 79, 81 and 97, of which we choose the maximum — 97.

In the third test, it is impossible to turn on exactly 5 sticks so that a sequence of numbers appears on the scoreboard.

assistant: To analyze the performance of the given C code and derive performance-characterizing invariants, we need to follow the specified phases.

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Compare Line-Level Hit Counts**:
   - The `solve` function is a recursive function that exhibits significantly higher hit counts on the slow input compared to the fast input.
   - The line `for (int i = 9; i >= 0; i--)` (line 38) inside `solve` has a very high hit count, indicating that the loop iterates multiple times.
   - The check `if ((cur >= 0) && (a[i] | arr[cur]) != a[i])` (line 40) also has high hit counts, suggesting it is a critical condition that is frequently evaluated.

2. **Pinpoint Lines or Functions with More Hits**:
   - Line 25 (`solve(int cur, int nn)`) is the main recursive function call with a high number of hits in the slow input run.
   - The loop starting at line 38 is particularly costly due to the number of iterations and the associated recursive calls.
   - The condition check on line 40 is crucial as it determines if the loop continues or if recursion proceeds.

3. **Inference on Data Structures and Control Flows**:
   - The recursion seems heavily dependent on the current and required number of sticks (`nn`), and the compatibility of the current digit (`arr[cur]`) with possible digits (`a[i]`).
   - The recursion depth and branching here are influenced significantly by how many possible digits `arr[cur]` can match after turning on additional sticks.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the observations, here are the natural language performance invariants:

1. **High Recursion Depth**:
   - "If the recursion depth within the `solve` function becomes significant due to the need to explore multiple digit possibilities, the program may slow down. This is particularly evident when many digits on the scoreboard partially resemble higher digits, prompting deeper recursion."

2. **Frequent Conditional Checks**:
   - "When each scoreboard digit has multiple potential matches due to many turned-off segments, leading to frequent evaluations of possible digits, performance may degrade. This is exacerbated when the input number of non-glowing segments `k` is large, necessitating extensive checks."

3. **Excessive Branching**:
   - "If a single digit can be transformed into multiple higher digits by turning on k segments, thereby creating many branches in the recursion, the program will likely experience slowdowns. This is especially true when the scoreboards digits mostly consist of '0's or '1's, which have more ways to evolve into higher numbers."

4. **Complexity from Individual Digit Compatibility**:
   - "When the scoreboard configuration includes digits with a high number of segments turned off, leading to complex compatibility checks with higher-valued digits, the recursion could repeatedly backtrack and try different configurations, slowing down execution."

These invariants reflect the conditions under which the program is likely to experience performance bottlenecks without relying on specific values from the slow input. They emphasize the depth and complexity of recursion, branching, and conditional checks that arise from the characteristics of scoreboard digits and disabled segments.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
Denis, after buying flowers and sweets (you will learn about this story in the next task), went to a date with Nastya to ask her to become a couple. Now, they are sitting in the cafe and finally... Denis asks her to be together, but ... Nastya doesn't give any answer. 

The poor boy was very upset because of that. He was so sad that he punched some kind of scoreboard with numbers. The numbers are displayed in the same way as on an electronic clock: each digit position consists of 7 segments, which can be turned on or off to display different numbers. The picture shows how all 10 decimal digits are displayed: 

<image>

After the punch, some segments stopped working, that is, some segments might stop glowing if they glowed earlier. But Denis remembered how many sticks were glowing and how many are glowing now. Denis broke exactly k segments and he knows which sticks are working now. Denis came up with the question: what is the maximum possible number that can appear on the board if you turn on exactly k sticks (which are off now)? 

It is allowed that the number includes leading zeros.

Input

The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000) — the number of digits on scoreboard and k (0 ≤ k ≤ 2000) — the number of segments that stopped working.

The next n lines contain one binary string of length 7, the i-th of which encodes the i-th digit of the scoreboard.

Each digit on the scoreboard consists of 7 segments. We number them, as in the picture below, and let the i-th place of the binary string be 0 if the i-th stick is not glowing and 1 if it is glowing. Then a binary string of length 7 will specify which segments are glowing now.

<image>

Thus, the sequences "1110111", "0010010", "1011101", "1011011", "0111010", "1101011", "1101111", "1010010", "1111111", "1111011" encode in sequence all digits from 0 to 9 inclusive.

Output

Output a single number consisting of n digits — the maximum number that can be obtained if you turn on exactly k sticks or -1, if it is impossible to turn on exactly k sticks so that a correct number appears on the scoreboard digits.

Examples

Input


1 7
0000000


Output


8

Input


2 5
0010010
0010010


Output


97

Input


3 5
0100001
1001001
1010011


Output


-1

Note

In the first test, we are obliged to include all 7 sticks and get one 8 digit on the scoreboard.

In the second test, we have sticks turned on so that units are formed. For 5 of additionally included sticks, you can get the numbers 07, 18, 34, 43, 70, 79, 81 and 97, of which we choose the maximum — 97.

In the third test, it is impossible to turn on exactly 5 sticks so that a sequence of numbers appears on the scoreboard.

Solution (C++ code):

assistant: Let's implement the performance-characterizing invariants derived in Phase 2 into C++ runtime checks. Here is the process broken down into two phases as requested:

### Phase 3: Implement the Natural Language Invariants in C++

1. **High Recursion Depth**
   - We will check if the recursion depth exceeds a certain threshold that represents a significant slowdown risk.

```cpp
void check_recursion_depth(int currentDepth, int maxAllowedDepth) {
    if (currentDepth > maxAllowedDepth) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to high recursion depth!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

2. **Frequent Conditional Checks and Branching**
   - This check will monitor if a digit can match multiple potential higher digits, creating a significant branching factor.

```cpp
void check_branching_factor(int branchingFactor, int maxAllowedFactor) {
    if (branchingFactor > maxAllowedFactor) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to excessive branching!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

3. **Complexity from Individual Digit Compatibility**
   - We need a check for when many digits need to be evaluated due to high complexity in matching.

```cpp
void check_digit_complexity(int complexity, int maxAllowedComplexity) {
    if (complexity > maxAllowedComplexity) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to high digit complexity!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrate the Checker Code into the Original Program

Now I will integrate these checks into the C++ program at suitable points to verify the performance characteristics without adding overhead in tight loops.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

const long long inf = 1e15;
const int mod = 1e9 + 7;
const int maxn = 1e6 + 3;
int n, m, k;
int a[11];
int dp[2005][2005];
int check[1 << 7 + 1];
int arr[2005];
int f = 0;

// Utility functions for checking performance conditions
void check_recursion_depth(int currentDepth, int maxAllowedDepth) {
    if (currentDepth > maxAllowedDepth) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to high recursion depth!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_branching_factor(int branchingFactor, int maxAllowedFactor) {
    if (branchingFactor > maxAllowedFactor) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to excessive branching!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_digit_complexity(int complexity, int maxAllowedComplexity) {
    if (complexity > maxAllowedComplexity) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to high digit complexity!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Convert binary string to decimal
int fun(int n) {
    int num = n;
    int dec_value = 0;
    int base = 1;
    int temp = num;
    while (temp) {
        int last_digit = temp % 10;
        temp = temp / 10;
        dec_value += last_digit * base;
        base = base * 2;
    }
    return dec_value;
}

// Recursive solving function with performance checks
string solve(int cur, int nn, int currentDepth) {
    check_recursion_depth(currentDepth, 50); // Check recursion depth

    if (f) return "";
    if (nn < 0) return "";
    if (nn == 0 && cur == n) {
        f = 1;
        return "";
    } else if (cur == n) {
        return "";
    }
    if (cur >= 0 && nn >= 0 && dp[cur][nn] == 0) {
        return "";
    }
    string res;
    int branchingFactor = 0; // Track branching factor

    for (int i = 9; i >= 0; i--) {
        string x = to_string(i);
        if ((cur >= 0) && (a[i] | arr[cur]) != a[i]) {
            continue;
        } else {
            if (a[i] - arr[cur] >= 0) {
                branchingFactor++;
                check_branching_factor(branchingFactor, 10); // Check branching factor
                res = solve(cur + 1, nn - check[(a[i] - arr[cur])], currentDepth + 1);
            }
        }
        if (f) {
            res = x + res;
            return res;
        }
    }
    if (f == 0) {
        dp[cur][nn] = 0;
    }
    return "";
}

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
    cin.tie(0);
    cout.tie(0);

    int t = 1;
    while (t--) {
        cin >> n >> k;
        a[0] = 119;
        a[1] = 18;
        a[2] = 93;
        a[3] = 91;
        a[4] = 58;
        a[5] = 107;
        a[6] = 111;
        a[7] = 82;
        a[8] = 127;
        a[9] = 123;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int temp;
            cin >> temp;
            int x = fun(temp);
            arr[i] = x;
        }

        memset(dp, -1, sizeof(dp));
        for (int i = 0; i < (1 << 7); i++) {
            check[i] = __builtin_popcount(i);
        }

        int nn = k;
        string ans = solve(0, nn, 0); // Initial depth is 0

        if (ans.size() < n) {
            cout << "-1\n";
        } else {
            cout << ans << '\n';
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Recursion Depth**: Integrated a check into the `solve` function to monitor recursion depth.
- **Branching Factor**: Added a branch factor counter inside the loop in `solve` and checked it after each potential branching.
- **Digit Complexity**: Considered as part of the branching factor and recursion depth, as these primarily determine the interaction between digits.

These checks aim to catch performance bottlenecks before they result in significantly slow execution, facilitating early detection and debugging.
