system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

In Berland it is the holiday of equality. In honor of the holiday the king decided to equalize the welfare of all citizens in Berland by the expense of the state treasury. 

Totally in Berland there are n citizens, the welfare of each of them is estimated as the integer in ai burles (burle is the currency in Berland).

You are the royal treasurer, which needs to count the minimum charges of the kingdom on the king's present. The king can only give money, he hasn't a power to take away them. 

Input

The first line contains the integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of citizens in the kingdom.

The second line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an, where ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ 106) — the welfare of the i-th citizen.

Output

In the only line print the integer S — the minimum number of burles which are had to spend.

Note

In the first example if we add to the first citizen 4 burles, to the second 3, to the third 2 and to the fourth 1, then the welfare of all citizens will equal 4.

In the second example it is enough to give one burle to the third citizen. 

In the third example it is necessary to give two burles to the first and the third citizens to make the welfare of citizens equal 3.

In the fourth example it is possible to give nothing to everyone because all citizens have 12 burles.

assistant: To diagnose the performance bottlenecks in the provided C program, we can follow the structured approach laid out in the task. Let's break it down in phases:

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Comparison of Line-level Hit Counts**:
   - The line with the highest difference in hit counts between the slow and fast runs is the nested loop starting on line 13.
   - Specifically, line 14 (the inner loop) is hit 5049 times in the slow input, compared to zero times in the fast input. This suggests a potential bottleneck.
   - Lines 15-18, where elements are being swapped, are executed 4 times in the slow input and not at all in the fast input.

2. **Inference**:
   - The nested loop on lines 13-18 appears to perform a selection sort operation, which is O(n^2) in complexity. The repeated comparisons and potential swaps account for a significant portion of the execution time, especially as `n` approaches its upper limit of 100.
   - For the slow input, this sorting operation contributes significantly to the slowdown because it involves both many elements close to zero and a very large element (1000000), causing numerous comparisons.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the observations, we can derive the following performance-characterizing invariants in natural language:

1. **Inefficient Sorting**:
   - **Description**: "When the number of citizens `n` approaches the maximum limit, and the distribution of welfare values includes outliers (e.g., one very high value among many low values), the nested sorting operation can become a performance bottleneck due to its quadratic complexity."
   - **Contextual Explanation**: This invariant highlights that the sorting algorithm used here is inefficient for larger datasets or when there are extreme value differences, leading to many unnecessary comparisons and potential swaps.

2. **High Comparison Volume**:
   - **Description**: "If the distribution of welfare values is uneven, with many citizens having similar low values and one or more having significantly higher values, the number of comparisons in the sorting phase is maximized, leading to slowed performance."
   - **Contextual Explanation**: This points to the inefficiency arising not just from the size of the dataset, but from the nature of the data distribution causing excessive iterations in the sorting loop.

3. **Selection Sort Specific Issue**:
   - **Description**: "In scenarios where `n` is large and the initial welfare values are predominantly low or zero, with sparse occurrences of high values, the use of a naive sorting algorithm like selection sort can significantly degrade performance."
   - **Contextual Explanation**: Here, the invariant focuses on the algorithm choice and how it's poorly suited for handling large discrepancies in input data values effectively.

### Additional Considerations

- Consider replacing the selection sort with a more efficient sorting algorithm, such as quicksort or mergesort, which have better average-case complexities.
- Optimize the code to handle cases where input distributions are known to cause performance issues, perhaps by employing specialized handling for outliers or pre-sorted data.

By addressing these performance-characterizing invariants, the program can be optimized to handle the problematic input patterns more efficiently.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
In Berland it is the holiday of equality. In honor of the holiday the king decided to equalize the welfare of all citizens in Berland by the expense of the state treasury. 

Totally in Berland there are n citizens, the welfare of each of them is estimated as the integer in ai burles (burle is the currency in Berland).

You are the royal treasurer, which needs to count the minimum charges of the kingdom on the king's present. The king can only give money, he hasn't a power to take away them. 

Input

The first line contains the integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of citizens in the kingdom.

The second line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an, where ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ 106) — the welfare of the i-th citizen.

Output

In the only line print the integer S — the minimum number of burles which are had to spend.

In the second example it is enough to give one burle to the third citizen. 

In the third example it is necessary to give two burles to the first and the third citizens to make the welfare of citizens equal 3.

In the fourth example it is possible to give nothing to everyone because all citizens have 12 burles.

{solution}


assistant: ### Phase 3: Implement Performance-Characterizing Invariants in C++

Based on the derived invariants, here are the checker functions implemented in C++:

1. **Inefficient Sorting Checker**:
   - **Invariant**: When the number of citizens `n` approaches the maximum limit and there are outliers in welfare values.
   ```cpp
   void check_sorting_invariant(bool condition) {
       if (condition) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to inefficient sorting!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **High Comparison Volume Checker**:
   - **Invariant**: If the data contains many similar low values and one or more high values.
   ```cpp
   void check_comparison_volume_invariant(bool condition) {
       if (condition) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to high comparison volume!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Selection Sort Specific Issue Checker**:
   - **Invariant**: Inefficient sorting when `n` is large with sparse high values.
   ```cpp
   void check_selection_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
       if (condition) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to selection sort inefficiency!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Integrate Checkers into the Original C++ Code

Below is the instrumented C++ code with the checker functions integrated:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Checker functions

/**
 * Checks if the inefficient sorting condition is met due to the large input size and outliers.
 * @param condition: Boolean condition indicating the presence of a potential inefficiency.
 */
void check_sorting_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to inefficient sorting!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

/**
 * Checks if the high comparison volume condition is met due to many low values and outliers.
 * @param condition: Boolean condition indicating the presence of excessive comparisons.
 */
void check_comparison_volume_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to high comparison volume!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

/**
 * Checks if the selection sort inefficiency condition is met due to large input with sparse high values.
 * @param condition: Boolean condition indicating inefficiency in sorting.
 */
void check_selection_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to selection sort inefficiency!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    long long int temp;
    long long int c = 0;
    long long int n;
    long long int *a;
    cin >> n;
    a = (long long int *)malloc(sizeof(long long int) * n);

    for (long long int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        cin >> a[i];
    }

    // Check for potential performance bottlenecks
    check_sorting_invariant(n > 50); // Inserted check before sorting begins
    check_comparison_volume_invariant(n == 100 && *max_element(a, a + n) > 100000); // Checks for high comparison

    for (long long int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
        for (long long int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
            if (a[j] > a[i]) {
                temp = a[i];
                a[i] = a[j];
                a[j] = temp;
            }
        }
    }

    // Check for selection sort inefficiency
    check_selection_sort_invariant(n == 100 && *min_element(a, a + n) == 0 && *max_element(a, a + n) == 1000000);

    for (long long int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        c += a[0] - a[i];
    }

    cout << c;
    free(a); // Ensure to free the allocated memory
    return 0;
}
```

  - The `check_sorting_invariant` is placed before the nested sorting loop to catch conditions before inefficiencies arise.
  - The `check_comparison_volume_invariant` and `check_selection_sort_invariant` are positioned to check specific data patterns that could lead to excessive comparisons or sort inefficiencies.
  
- **Condition Logic**:
  - The logic in each checker reflects conditions derived from the natural language invariants, considering the constraints and typical outlier scenarios in the data.

This instrumented code will help in recognizing potential performance pitfalls dynamically during execution, aiding in debugging and optimization efforts.
