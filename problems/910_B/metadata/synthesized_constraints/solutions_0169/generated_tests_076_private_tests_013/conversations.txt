system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

Petya has equal wooden bars of length n. He wants to make a frame for two equal doors. Each frame has two vertical (left and right) sides of length a and one top side of length b. A solid (i.e. continuous without breaks) piece of bar is needed for each side.

Determine a minimal number of wooden bars which are needed to make the frames for two doors. Petya can cut the wooden bars into any parts, but each side of each door should be a solid piece of a wooden bar (or a whole wooden bar).

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1 000) — the length of each wooden bar.

The second line contains a single integer a (1 ≤ a ≤ n) — the length of the vertical (left and right) sides of a door frame.

The third line contains a single integer b (1 ≤ b ≤ n) — the length of the upper side of a door frame.

Output

Print the minimal number of wooden bars with length n which are needed to make the frames for two doors.

assistant: To analyze the given C program, we need to identify why the "slow" input case takes significantly longer compared to the "fast" input case, even though both inputs have similar sizes. We will perform the analysis in two phases as described in the task.

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Line-Level Hit Count Analysis**:
   - The function `go` is the main recursive function called by the program and shows significant differences in hit counts between the slow and fast inputs.
   - Lines within the `go` function, especially lines 5 through 21, are executed much more frequently for the slow input. Particularly:
     - Line 11 (`for` loop) and Line 12 (bit-check condition) have notably higher execution counts.
     - The recursive calls on Line 14, Line 15, Line 17, and Line 18 account for a majority of the execution delay.
   - The hit counts on Line 8 and Line 9 indicate that the base condition `msk == 63` is met more frequently in the fast scenario.

2. **Interaction with Data Structures**:
   - The program uses a bitmask (`msk`) to track which parts of the door frame have been completed.
   - The recursive function calculates different configurations or combinations of bars to meet the size requirements.

3. **Recursive Nature and Input Constraints**:
   - With `n = 6`, `a = 1`, `b = 1` (slow input), the program explores many configurations because small values for `a` and `b` allow for numerous recursive combinations, leading to high recursion depth and branching factors.
   - The fast input (`n = 6`, `a = 6`, `b = 1`) simplifies the process since larger `a` minimizes the number of recursive calls needed to satisfy the conditions, leading to fewer hit counts.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the analysis, here are performance-characterizing invariants in natural language:

1. **Invariant 1: Small Side Lengths Allow Extensive Recursion**
   - "If the side lengths `a` and `b` are small relative to `n`, the recursive search space grows significantly, leading to a large number of recursive evaluations due to the vast number of possible configurations."

2. **Invariant 2: High Recursive Depth and Branching**
   - "When the `carry` value is repeatedly insufficient to fulfill the requirements of current frame parts (`a` or `b`), the recursive invocation depth increases, and the program explores extensive configurations, causing a slowdown."

3. **Invariant 3: Bitmask Completion Complexity**
   - "For inputs where side lengths `a` and `b` are small enough to require numerous small pieces, the bitmask (`msk`) completion takes many iterations, leading to a significant increase in function calls."

These invariants help pinpoint scenarios where the recursive exploration becomes expensive and time-consuming, leading to performance bottlenecks in the program.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
Petya has equal wooden bars of length n. He wants to make a frame for two equal doors. Each frame has two vertical (left and right) sides of length a and one top side of length b. A solid (i.e. continuous without breaks) piece of bar is needed for each side.

Determine a minimal number of wooden bars which are needed to make the frames for two doors. Petya can cut the wooden bars into any parts, but each side of each door should be a solid piece of a wooden bar (or a whole wooden bar).

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1 000) — the length of each wooden bar.

The second line contains a single integer a (1 ≤ a ≤ n) — the length of the vertical (left and right) sides of a door frame.

The third line contains a single integer b (1 ≤ b ≤ n) — the length of the upper side of a door frame.

Output

Print the minimal number of wooden bars with length n which are needed to make the frames for two doors.

{solution}


assistant: Let's perform Phase 3 by translating the performance-characterizing invariants into C++ code.

### Phase 3: Implementing Performance-Characterizing Invariants in C++

Based on the natural language invariants derived in Phase 2, we will implement the corresponding C++ checker functions:

1. **Invariant 1: Small Side Lengths Allow Extensive Recursion**
   - We want to check if `a` and `b` are small relative to `n`. To trigger this condition, we can check if their sum is significantly less than `n`, as this scenario allows numerous small configurations.

```cpp
void check_small_side_lengths(int n, int a, int b) {
    if (a + b <= n / 3) {  // Arbitrary threshold indicating potential recursion depth
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - small side lengths allow extensive recursion!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

2. **Invariant 2: High Recursive Depth and Branching**
   - To detect high recursive depth and branching, we can estimate potential depth based on the values of `a` and `b` compared to `n`.

```cpp
void check_recursive_depth(int n, int a, int b) {
    if (n / a > 10 && n / b > 10) {  // Thresholds indicating high potential for depth and branching
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high recursive depth and branching!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

3. **Invariant 3: Bitmask Completion Complexity**
   - For this invariant, we need to check if the bitmask (msk) will take extensive iterations for completion. This can be estimated by checking if each part (side) of the frame is small, leading to numerous operations.

```cpp
void check_bitmask_complexity(int n, int a, int b) {
    if (a <= n / 4 && b <= n / 4) {  // Using a threshold indicating high complexity in bitmask completion
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - bitmask completion complexity!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrating Checks into the Original Program

Now, let's integrate these checks into the provided C++ program.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int n, a, b;
int ans = 10000;

void check_small_side_lengths(int n, int a, int b) {
    if (a + b <= n / 3) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - small side lengths allow extensive recursion!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_recursive_depth(int n, int a, int b) {
    if (n / a > 10 && n / b > 10) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high recursive depth and branching!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_bitmask_complexity(int n, int a, int b) {
    if (a <= n / 4 && b <= n / 4) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - bitmask completion complexity!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void go(int msk, int carry, int tot) {
    if (tot > 6) return;
    if (msk == 63) {
        ans = min(ans, tot);
        return;
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
        if ((msk & (1 << i)) == 0) {
            if (i <= 3) {
                if (carry >= a) go(msk | (1 << i), carry - a, tot);
                go(msk | (1 << i), n - a, tot + 1);
            } else {
                if (carry >= b) go(msk | (1 << i), carry - b, tot);
                go(msk | (1 << i), n - b, tot + 1);
            }
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    int i, j;
    cin >> n >> a >> b;

    // Insert performance checkers before running the main logic
    check_small_side_lengths(n, a, b);
    check_recursive_depth(n, a, b);
    check_bitmask_complexity(n, a, b);

    go(0, 0, 0);
    cout << ans << endl;
}
```

### Explanation

- The checkers are inserted before the main recursive function `go` is called to ensure the program checks the conditions without impacting the performance of the recursive calls.
- Each checker function corresponds to an invariant derived from the analysis, providing early detection of potential performance bottlenecks.
