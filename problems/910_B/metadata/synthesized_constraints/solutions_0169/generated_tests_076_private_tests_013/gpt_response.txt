=== Invariants Response ===
To analyze the given C program, we need to identify why the "slow" input case takes significantly longer compared to the "fast" input case, even though both inputs have similar sizes. We will perform the analysis in two phases as described in the task.

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Line-Level Hit Count Analysis**:
   - The function `go` is the main recursive function called by the program and shows significant differences in hit counts between the slow and fast inputs.
   - Lines within the `go` function, especially lines 5 through 21, are executed much more frequently for the slow input. Particularly:
     - Line 11 (`for` loop) and Line 12 (bit-check condition) have notably higher execution counts.
     - The recursive calls on Line 14, Line 15, Line 17, and Line 18 account for a majority of the execution delay.
   - The hit counts on Line 8 and Line 9 indicate that the base condition `msk == 63` is met more frequently in the fast scenario.

2. **Interaction with Data Structures**:
   - The program uses a bitmask (`msk`) to track which parts of the door frame have been completed.
   - The recursive function calculates different configurations or combinations of bars to meet the size requirements.

3. **Recursive Nature and Input Constraints**:
   - With `n = 6`, `a = 1`, `b = 1` (slow input), the program explores many configurations because small values for `a` and `b` allow for numerous recursive combinations, leading to high recursion depth and branching factors.
   - The fast input (`n = 6`, `a = 6`, `b = 1`) simplifies the process since larger `a` minimizes the number of recursive calls needed to satisfy the conditions, leading to fewer hit counts.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the analysis, here are performance-characterizing invariants in natural language:

1. **Invariant 1: Small Side Lengths Allow Extensive Recursion**
   - "If the side lengths `a` and `b` are small relative to `n`, the recursive search space grows significantly, leading to a large number of recursive evaluations due to the vast number of possible configurations."

2. **Invariant 2: High Recursive Depth and Branching**
   - "When the `carry` value is repeatedly insufficient to fulfill the requirements of current frame parts (`a` or `b`), the recursive invocation depth increases, and the program explores extensive configurations, causing a slowdown."

3. **Invariant 3: Bitmask Completion Complexity**
   - "For inputs where side lengths `a` and `b` are small enough to require numerous small pieces, the bitmask (`msk`) completion takes many iterations, leading to a significant increase in function calls."

These invariants help pinpoint scenarios where the recursive exploration becomes expensive and time-consuming, leading to performance bottlenecks in the program.

=== Checker Response ===
Let's perform Phase 3 by translating the performance-characterizing invariants into C++ code.

### Phase 3: Implementing Performance-Characterizing Invariants in C++

Based on the natural language invariants derived in Phase 2, we will implement the corresponding C++ checker functions:

1. **Invariant 1: Small Side Lengths Allow Extensive Recursion**
   - We want to check if `a` and `b` are small relative to `n`. To trigger this condition, we can check if their sum is significantly less than `n`, as this scenario allows numerous small configurations.

```cpp
void check_small_side_lengths(int n, int a, int b) {
    if (a + b <= n / 3) {  // Arbitrary threshold indicating potential recursion depth
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - small side lengths allow extensive recursion!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

2. **Invariant 2: High Recursive Depth and Branching**
   - To detect high recursive depth and branching, we can estimate potential depth based on the values of `a` and `b` compared to `n`.

```cpp
void check_recursive_depth(int n, int a, int b) {
    if (n / a > 10 && n / b > 10) {  // Thresholds indicating high potential for depth and branching
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high recursive depth and branching!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

3. **Invariant 3: Bitmask Completion Complexity**
   - For this invariant, we need to check if the bitmask (msk) will take extensive iterations for completion. This can be estimated by checking if each part (side) of the frame is small, leading to numerous operations.

```cpp
void check_bitmask_complexity(int n, int a, int b) {
    if (a <= n / 4 && b <= n / 4) {  // Using a threshold indicating high complexity in bitmask completion
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - bitmask completion complexity!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrating Checks into the Original Program

Now, let's integrate these checks into the provided C++ program.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int n, a, b;
int ans = 10000;

void check_small_side_lengths(int n, int a, int b) {
    if (a + b <= n / 3) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - small side lengths allow extensive recursion!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_recursive_depth(int n, int a, int b) {
    if (n / a > 10 && n / b > 10) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high recursive depth and branching!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_bitmask_complexity(int n, int a, int b) {
    if (a <= n / 4 && b <= n / 4) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - bitmask completion complexity!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void go(int msk, int carry, int tot) {
    if (tot > 6) return;
    if (msk == 63) {
        ans = min(ans, tot);
        return;
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
        if ((msk & (1 << i)) == 0) {
            if (i <= 3) {
                if (carry >= a) go(msk | (1 << i), carry - a, tot);
                go(msk | (1 << i), n - a, tot + 1);
            } else {
                if (carry >= b) go(msk | (1 << i), carry - b, tot);
                go(msk | (1 << i), n - b, tot + 1);
            }
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    int i, j;
    cin >> n >> a >> b;

    // Insert performance checkers before running the main logic
    check_small_side_lengths(n, a, b);
    check_recursive_depth(n, a, b);
    check_bitmask_complexity(n, a, b);

    go(0, 0, 0);
    cout << ans << endl;
}
```

### Explanation

- The checkers are inserted before the main recursive function `go` is called to ensure the program checks the conditions without impacting the performance of the recursive calls.
- Each checker function corresponds to an invariant derived from the analysis, providing early detection of potential performance bottlenecks.
