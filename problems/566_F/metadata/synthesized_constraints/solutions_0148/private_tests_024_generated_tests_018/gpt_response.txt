### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

Upon analyzing the hit counts, the main difference between the slow and fast runs appears in the loop beginning at line 15:

```cpp
for (int tmp = val * 2; tmp <= maxn; tmp += val)
  cnt[tmp] = max(cnt[tmp], cnt[val] + 1);
```

- **Hit Count Analysis**: The inner loop (lines 15-16) experiences a significantly higher hit count in the slow input (1,000,001 for line 15 and 999,999 for line 16) compared to the fast input (500,001 for line 15 and 499,999 for line 16).
  
- **Cause of Increased Hits**: The increased hit count is due to a higher number of iterations in the loop, caused by the initial `val` being 1 in the slow input. This results in iterating across the entire range up to `maxn`, whereas the fast input starts from 2, reducing the number of iterations by half.

- **Data Interaction**: The complexity arises because the loop iterates over every multiple of `val` up to `maxn`. When `val` is small, particularly 1, this becomes a full range iteration, making the operation costly.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the above analysis, here are the performance-characterizing invariants that explain under what conditions the code slows down:

1. **Invariant 1**: "When the smallest number in the input set is 1, the program enters a slow path. This is because the inner loop iterates over all multiples of the smallest number, leading to a high number of iterations."

2. **Invariant 2**: "The program may slow down significantly when the input contains numbers that lead to many iterations over the range up to `maxn`. Specifically, if the smallest number divides a large portion of the numbers up to `maxn`, it results in frequent updates to the count array."

3. **Invariant 3**: "If the input includes a number that is a divisor of many numbers within the given constraint range, the code will exhibit slower performance due to excessive loop iterations over multiples of that number."

These invariants capture the conditions leading to slow performance, focusing on the impact of small divisible values on loop iterations, without relying on specific numerical values from the slow input. They guide towards understanding how input patterns like small divisors lead to performance issues.

### Phase 3: Implementing Invariants as Checker Code in C++

Let's translate the natural language invariants derived in Phase 2 into C++ checker code:

1. **Invariant 1 Check**: "When the smallest number in the input set is 1, the program enters a slow path."
   
   ```cpp
   void check_smallest_number_invariant(int val) {
       if (val == 1) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to smallest number being 1!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Invariant 2 Check**: "The program may slow down significantly when the input contains numbers that lead to many iterations over the range up to `maxn`."
   
   ```cpp
   void check_divisor_invariant(int val) {
       if (val <= 10) {  // Using a small threshold as a proxy for high iteration counts
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to low divisor value!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Invariant 3 Check**: "If the input includes a number that is a divisor of many numbers within the given constraint range."
   
   ```cpp
   void check_large_divisor_invariant(int val) {
       if (val == 1) {  // Effectively same as first invariant for this problem
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to large divisor set!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```
   
These checkers are designed to detect potential performance bottlenecks based on the smallest input value.

### Phase 4: Integrating Checkers into the Original Program

Let's integrate these checks into the original C++ code, placing them effectively without adding overhead to tight loops:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
const int maxn = 1e6;
int cnt[maxn + 10];

// Function to check performance invariants
void check_smallest_number_invariant(int val) {
    if (val == 1) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to smallest number being 1!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_divisor_invariant(int val) {
    if (val <= 10) {  // Using 10 as a threshold for demonstrating potential divisibility impact
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to low divisor value!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    cin.tie(0);
    ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
    
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    
    int ans = 1;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        int val;
        cin >> val;
        
        // Integrate checks before any processing with the number
        if (i == 0) {  // Only need to check for the first (smallest) number
            check_smallest_number_invariant(val);
        }
        check_divisor_invariant(val);
        
        cnt[val] = max(cnt[val], 1);
        for (int tmp = val * 2; tmp <= maxn; tmp += val) {
            cnt[tmp] = max(cnt[tmp], cnt[val] + 1);
        }
        ans = max(ans, cnt[val]);
    }
    
    cout << ans << '\n';
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

- **Checker Placement**: We place the checks right after reading the input value but before any complex operations are performed, to avoid overhead in critical loops.
- **Invariant Overlaps**: Since the invariants overlap (e.g., smallest value being 1), we strategically place checks to minimize redundancy.
- **Abstraction and Generalization**: We use a small threshold (like 10) in `check_divisor_invariant` to catch cases where numbers might frequently divide a large set, abstracting away from specific numbers but respecting the constraints.

This instrumented code will help identify performance bottlenecks under conditions likely to trigger slow paths.
