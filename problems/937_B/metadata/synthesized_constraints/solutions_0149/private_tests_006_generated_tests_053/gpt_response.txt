### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Line-Level Hit Comparison**:
   - The function `factors()` (line 3) is called 64 times for the slow input versus 2 times for the fast input, suggesting it significantly contributes to the slowdown.
   - Inside `factors()`, the loop on line 5 runs 2,023,872 times for the slow input compared to only 63,250 times for the fast input.
   - The condition `if (n % i == 0)` (line 6) and subsequent logic are executed extensively for the slow input, indicating the high computational cost of factor determination.

2. **Interaction with Data Structures and Loops**:
   - The loop in `solve()` (line 27) iterates 64 times for the slow input but only 2 times for the fast.
   - Inside the loop, the `factors()` function explores divisors of `y` decrementing `y` when certain conditions are not met, making this nested loop structure a likely inefficiency point.
   - The heavy iteration in `factors()` suggests that repeated calculations for finding divisors are the bottleneck.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **Natural Language Invariant 1**:
   - "If the value of `y` is close to `p` and has no suitable branch higher than `p` due to closely packed possible divisors, the program may enter a slow path due to excessive factorization attempts."

2. **Natural Language Invariant 2**:
   - "If `y` requires multiple downward iterations to find a suitable branch, because many consecutive branches are reachable by grasshoppers, the program will slow down due to repeated and costly divisor checks."

3. **Natural Language Invariant 3**:
   - "When factors of `y` contain no integers greater than `p` early in the loop, frequent invocation of factorization logic without early termination causes significant slowdown."

### Observations

- The slowdown is primarily due to the repeated expensive calculation of the factors of `y` in a decrementing loop without finding a suitable branch quickly.
- The inefficiency arises when `y` is repeatedly reduced but no factors greater than `p` are found early enough to break out of the loop efficiently.

### Phase 3: Implementing the Natural Language Invariants in C++

Below are the C++ code snippets for each of the performance-characterizing invariants derived in natural language:

1. **Invariant 1**: If `y` is close to `p` and no suitable branch is quickly found due to densely packed possible divisors, the program has a potential slowdown.

```cpp
void check_close_to_p_invariant(long long y, long long p, int iteration_count) {
    if (y <= p + 10 && iteration_count > 10) { // Arbitrary threshold for illustration
        cerr << "Warning: close_to_p_invariant triggered - excessive iterations for closely packed branches!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

2. **Invariant 2**: If `y` requires multiple downward iterations to find a suitable branch, it indicates potential slowdown due to repeated divisor checks.

```cpp
void check_excessive_iterations_invariant(int iteration_count) {
    if (iteration_count > 50) { // Arbitrary threshold
        cerr << "Warning: excessive_iterations_invariant triggered - too many iterations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

3. **Invariant 3**: If factors of `y` do not include integers greater than `p` early, there's inefficiency in the loop.

```cpp
void check_inefficient_factorization_invariant(int divisor_checks) {
    if (divisor_checks > 100000) { // Arbitrary large threshold for factor checks
        cerr << "Warning: inefficient_factorization_invariant triggered - too many divisor checks!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrating the Checkers into the Original Program

Here is the original C++ program instrumented with the performance-characterizing invariants:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

vector<long long> factors(long long n, int &flag, long long p, int &divisor_checks) {
    vector<long long> ans;
    for (int i = 1; i <= sqrt(n); i++) {
        divisor_checks++;
        if (n % i == 0) {
            if (n / i == i) {
                ans.push_back(i);
                if (i <= p && i != 1) flag = 1;
            } else {
                if (i <= p && i != 1) flag = 1;
                if (n / i <= p && n / i != i) flag = 1;
                ans.push_back(i);
                ans.push_back(n / i);
            }
        }
    }
    return ans;
}

void solve() {
    int t = 1;
    while (t--) {
        long long int p, y;
        cin >> p >> y;
        long long int temp = y;
        long long int ans;
        int iteration_count = 0;
        
        while (temp--) {
            int flag = 0;
            int divisor_checks = 0;
            vector<long long int> div = factors(y, flag, p, divisor_checks);

            // Check for performance bottlenecks
            check_excessive_iterations_invariant(iteration_count);
            check_close_to_p_invariant(y, p, iteration_count);
            check_inefficient_factorization_invariant(divisor_checks);

            if (div.size() == 2) {
                ans = y;
                break;
            } else if (flag == 0) {
                ans = y;
                break;
            }
            y--;
            iteration_count++;
        }
        
        if (ans > p)
            cout << ans << endl;
        else
            cout << -1 << endl;
    }
}

int main() {
    solve();
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:

- **`check_close_to_p_invariant`:** Added just after factorization to ensure the `y` is not too close to `p` causing unnecessary checks.
- **`check_excessive_iterations_invariant`:** Added inside the loop in `solve()` to track how many times the loop is iterating without resolving.
- **`check_inefficient_factorization_invariant`:** Added inside the `factors` function to report if divisor checks are too high, indicating inefficiency.

These checks are designed to detect the conditions under which the program experiences performance bottlenecks as identified in the natural language invariants.
