=== Invariants Response ===
To analyze and derive performance-characterizing invariants for the provided C program, we need to focus on lines that have significant differences in hit count between the fast and slow inputs. 

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

Based on the hit count information, we observe the following:

1. **Loops and Logic with High Hit Counts:**
   - Lines 44 to 57 have significantly more hits for the slow input compared to the fast input. The outer loop (line 44) iterates 502 times, but the inner loop (line 46) is executed over 15 million times.
   - The inner loop at lines 46-50 checks divisibility up to the square root of each number in the range. This is likely causing a slowdown when `j * j <= i` is true for a large number of iterations, revealing a high computational complexity for checking primes.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Let's translate the analysis into natural language performance invariants:

1. **High Iteration Count Due to Prime Checking Loop:**
   - **Invariant:** "If the gap between `p` and `y` is large, and many numbers need to be checked for primality, the number of operations grows significantly, leading to slow performance. This is especially true when both `p` and `y` are large, causing the primality check loop to run a high number of times."

2. **Primality Testing in Large Intervals:**
   - **Invariant:** "The program becomes inefficient when the bounds `a` (which is `p`) and `b` (which is `y`) are such that many integers need to be validated against all divisors up to their square root. This can lead to quadratic-like behavior in terms of operations due to nested loops, particularly when `b` exceeds `a` by a substantial margin."

3. **Nested Loop Complexity with Large Numbers:**
   - **Invariant:** "The code faces a slowdown when checking each branch number from `b-k` to `b` (where `k` is minimized to 500) for primality, especially if `b` is at or near the upper constraint. This results in excessive iterations of the inner loop, which checks divisors up to the root of each number."

These invariants suggest that the primary bottleneck arises from the inefficient handling of large numbers and the primality check within a bounded range. To mitigate this, consider optimizing the primality testing logic or limiting the range more effectively when `b` is significantly larger than `a`.

=== Checker Response ===
Let's proceed with Phase 3 and Phase 4 as outlined:

### Phase 3: Implement C++ Code for Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the natural language invariants derived earlier, we need to implement checks in C++. Here's how we can translate the invariants into C++ code:

1. **High Iteration Count Due to Prime Checking Loop:**
   ```cpp
   void check_prime_loop_invariant(int p, int y) {
       int k = y - p;
       if (k > 500 && y > 1000000) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to large number range for primality check!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Primality Testing in Large Intervals:**
   ```cpp
   void check_large_interval_invariant(int p, int y) {
       if (y > 1000000 && y - p > 500) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to large primality test interval!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Nested Loop Complexity with Large Numbers:**
   ```cpp
   void check_nested_loop_invariant(int p, int y) {
       if (y > 1000000 && y - p > 500) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to complex nested loop operations!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

These checks are designed to identify conditions where the performance might degrade due to large ranges or inefficient iterations in the primality testing loops.

### Phase 4: Integrate Checkers into the Original Program

Now, let's integrate these invariants into the original C++ program. We will place the checks at suitable locations in the control flow:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Phase 3: Checker functions for performance invariants
void check_prime_loop_invariant(int p, int y) {
    int k = y - p;
    if (k > 500 && y > 1000000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to large number range for primality check!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_large_interval_invariant(int p, int y) {
    if (y > 1000000 && y - p > 500) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to large primality test interval!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_nested_loop_invariant(int p, int y) {
    if (y > 1000000 && y - p > 500) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to complex nested loop operations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
    int a, b;
    cin >> a >> b;
    
    // Phase 4: Insert performance checks after input
    check_prime_loop_invariant(a, b);
    check_large_interval_invariant(a, b);
    check_nested_loop_invariant(a, b);
    
    if (a >= b) {
        cout << -1;
        return 0;
    }
    
    int k = b - a;
    if (a <= 1000000 && b <= 1000000) {
        int i, j;
        int A[1000006];
        int flag = 0;
        int ans = 0;
        for (i = 3; i <= 1000000; i++) {
            A[i] = 1;
        }
        for (i = 2; i <= a; i++) {
            for (j = i; j <= b; j = j + i) {
                A[j] = 0;
            }
        }
        for (i = 3; i <= b; i++) {
            if (A[i] == 1) {
                ans = i;
                flag = 1;
            }
        }
        if (flag) {
            cout << ans;
            return 0;
        }
        cout << -1;
        return 0;
    }
    if (a > 100000) {
        k = min(k, 500);
        int i, j;
        int flag = 0;
        int ans = 0;
        int flag1 = 0;
        for (i = max(2, b - k); i <= b; i++) {
            flag = 0;
            for (j = 2; j * j <= i; j++) {
                if (i % j == 0) {
                    flag = 1;
                }
            }
            if (flag == 0) {
                if (i > a) {
                    flag1 = 1;
                    ans = i;
                }
            }
        }
        if (flag1) {
            cout << ans;
            return 0;
        }
        cout << -1;
        return 0;
    }
    if (a <= 100000) {
        k = min(k, 500);
        int i, j;
        int flag = 0;
        int ans = 0;
        int flag1 = 0;
        for (i = max(2, b - k); i <= b; i++) {
            flag = 0;
            for (j = 2; j <= a; j++) {
                if (i % j == 0) {
                    flag = 1;
                }
            }
            if (flag == 0) {
                if (i > a) {
                    flag1 = 1;
                    ans = i;
                }
            }
        }
        if (flag1) {
            cout << ans;
            return 0;
        }
        cout << -1;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

- **Checkers**: The check functions are defined at the beginning of the program. They are called immediately after reading inputs to ensure that performance issues are caught early.
- **Placement**: The checks are inserted after the input is read and before the main logic begins. This avoids adding overhead in the loops themselves, adhering to best practices of not degrading performance significantly with the checks.

These C++ code snippets should help in catching and diagnosing potential performance bottlenecks that could arise with certain input conditions.
