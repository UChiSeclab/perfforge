=== Invariants Response ===
To analyze the performance bottlenecks in the given C program, we'll follow the tasks outlined in two phases.

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Compare Line-Level Hit Counts**:
   - The line `for (i = 2; i * i <= y && i <= p; i++)` (line 12) and `grass[(y / i) * i].push_back(i)` (line 13) are executed 31,624 times on the slow input but not at all on the fast input. This indicates a significant performance difference.
   - Additionally, the line `for (int k : grass[i])` (line 17) and `grass[i - k].push_back(k)` (line 18) are executed 32 and 31 times, respectively, on the slow input but not on the fast input.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The first loop from line 12 to line 14 is executed very frequently in the slow input, suggesting that operations within this loop significantly contribute to the slowdown.
   - This loop likely explores potential factors of `y` for calculating the branches the grasshoppers could reach, using a sieve-like approach, which becomes costly for larger values.
   - The second loop, due to its conditions and the operations inside involving the `grass` map, may also introduce overhead when iterating from `y` down to `p`.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **Generate Natural Language Statements**:

   - **Invariant #1: High Iteration Count in the Sieve Loop**
     - **Description**: "The program slows down significantly when the upper bound `y` is much larger than `p`, as the sieve computation loop runs for many iterations due to the condition `i * i <= y`."
     - **Reasoning**: This invariant suggests that when `y` is significantly larger than `p`, especially approaching the order of `y = 10^9`, the number of iterations in the loop increases, impacting performance.

   - **Invariant #2: Map Operations Due to High Value of `y`**
     - **Description**: "When `y` is large, compared to the possible branches `p`, the map operations increase in frequency, as more elements are potentially added to the `grass` map, degrading performance."
     - **Reasoning**: The operations on the `grass` map, especially the `push_back` operations inside the nested loop, become a bottleneck if the structure grows large as `y` increases.

   - **Invariant #3: Limited Usefulness of the Decrementing Loop**
     - **Description**: "Performance may further degrade when the loop iterating from `y` to `p` does not find a suitable branch quickly, resulting in additional checks and operations."
     - **Reasoning**: The conditions checked inside this loop depend on the results prepared by the first loop, and if `y` is much more significant than `p`, it implies more iterations, impacting performance.

2. **Thresholds and Conditions**:
   - These invariants highlight that the program's performance is particularly sensitive when `y` approaches the upper constraint of `10^9`. The issues arise from excessively high iterations in loops and operations on data structures that become extensive due to these iterations.

### Summary

The main performance bottlenecks arise from large iteration counts and operations on data structures when `y` is significantly larger than `p`, particularly as `y` approaches the problem's constraints. These conditions lead to increased processing times, primarily due to the computational cost of the loop operations and the manipulation of the `grass` map.

=== Checker Response ===
Let's perform the tasks outlined for Phase 3 and Phase 4, transforming the performance-characterizing invariants into C++ code and integrating them into the provided program.

### Phase 3: Implement the Invariants as Checker Code in C++

Here are the performance-characterizing invariants translated into C++ runtime checks.

```cpp
void check_sieve_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to high iteration count in sieve loop!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_map_operations_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to excessive map operations with large y!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_decrementing_loop_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to prolonged decrementing loop!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrate the Checkers into the Original Program

Now, let's integrate these checks into the original C++ code, ensuring they're placed at points that maximize their effectiveness without introducing excessive overhead.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Checker functions for performance invariants
void check_sieve_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to high iteration count in sieve loop!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_map_operations_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to excessive map operations with large y!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_decrementing_loop_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered due to prolonged decrementing loop!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    cin.tie(0), ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
    int p, y, i;
    cin >> p >> y;

    // Check if y is much larger than p and might cause performance issues in loops
    check_sieve_invariant(y > p * p);

    if (p == y) {
        cout << -1;
        return 0;
    }

    map<int, vector<int> > grass;
    for (i = 2; i * i <= y && i <= p; i++) {
        grass[(y / i) * i].push_back(i);
    }

    // Check map growth due to large y
    check_map_operations_invariant(grass.size() > 100000); // Hypothetical threshold for a large map size

    for (i = y; i > p; i--) {
        if (grass.find(i) != grass.end()) {
            for (int k : grass[i]) {
                grass[i - k].push_back(k);
            }
        } else {
            cout << i << "\n";
            return 0;
        }

        // Check prolonged decrementing loop
        check_decrementing_loop_invariant((y - i) > 100000); // Hypothetical threshold for excessive decrementing
    }
    
    cout << -1;
}
```

### Explanation

- **Sieve Loop Check**: Placed after input, it checks if `y` is significantly larger than `p * p`, potentially leading to higher iterations in the sieve loop.
- **Map Operations Check**: Placed after the initial buildup of the `grass` map, it checks if the map has grown too large, indicating potential inefficiencies.
- **Decrementing Loop Check**: Placed inside the loop that decrements from `y` to `p`, it ensures that the loop doesn't exceed a reasonable threshold for iterations, which could indicate a performance issue.

Each check provides a warning and aborts execution to help diagnose and prevent performance bottlenecks during testing or fuzzing.
