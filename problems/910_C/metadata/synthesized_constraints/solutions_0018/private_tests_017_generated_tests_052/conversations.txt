system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

Petya has n positive integers a1, a2, ..., an. 

His friend Vasya decided to joke and replaced all digits in Petya's numbers with a letters. He used the lowercase letters of the Latin alphabet from 'a' to 'j' and replaced all digits 0 with one letter, all digits 1 with another letter and so on. For any two different digits Vasya used distinct letters from 'a' to 'j'.

Your task is to restore Petya's numbers. The restored numbers should be positive integers without leading zeros. Since there can be multiple ways to do it, determine the minimum possible sum of all Petya's numbers after the restoration. It is guaranteed that before Vasya's joke all Petya's numbers did not have leading zeros.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1 000) — the number of Petya's numbers.

Each of the following lines contains non-empty string si consisting of lowercase Latin letters from 'a' to 'j' — the Petya's numbers after Vasya's joke. The length of each string does not exceed six characters.

Output

Determine the minimum sum of all Petya's numbers after the restoration. The restored numbers should be positive integers without leading zeros. It is guaranteed that the correct restore (without leading zeros) exists for all given tests.

Examples

Input

3
ab
de
aj


Output

47


Input

5
abcdef
ghij
bdef
accbd
g


Output

136542


Input

aa


Output

44

Note

In the first example, you need to replace the letter 'a' with the digit 1, the letter 'b' with the digit 0, the letter 'd' with the digit 2, the letter 'e' with the digit 3, and the letter 'j' with the digit 4. So after the restoration numbers will look like [10, 23, 14]. The sum of them is equal to 47, which is the minimum possible sum of the numbers after the correct restoration.

In the second example the numbers after the restoration can look like: [120468, 3579, 2468, 10024, 3]. 

In the second example the numbers after the restoration can look like: [11, 22, 11].

assistant: To diagnose the performance bottlenecks in the provided C program, we need to focus on the differences between the fast and slow input runs and analyze the hit counts for each line of code. This analysis will help identify which parts of the code are contributing to the slowdown and allow us to generate performance-characterizing invariants.

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Line-Level Hit Count Analysis:**
   - **`dfs(int col, int sum)`:** This function is a depth-first search-like recursive function attempting to find the minimum sum by exploring permutations of digit assignments. It is called a significantly larger number of times with the slow input (`5918460` hits) than with the fast input (`3945640` hits).
   - **Line `25`:** The loop inside `dfs` appears to be the main contributor to the high hit count, with `41152980` hits for the slow input versus `27435320` for the fast input. This suggests a combinatorial explosion in recursive calls.
   - **Lines `27`, `28`, `29`:** These lines are crucial as they handle the recursive call and backtracking mechanism, showing similar high hit counts as `dfs`.

2. **Interaction with Data Structures:**
   - The function `dfs` interacts with arrays `ad` and `vis`, and a large number of permutations of these arrays are explored due to the recursive depth-first nature of the function.

3. **Input Constraints:**
   - Given that `n ≤ 1000` and string lengths are at most six characters, the problem could arise from the permutations of the 10 possible digit mappings being explored, especially when the input data causes a larger branching factor.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the analysis, we can derive conditions that are likely to trigger a slow path:

1. **Recursive Permutations and Branching Factor:**
   - **Invariant:** "If the recursion in the digit assignment has to explore many permutations due to multiple candidate letters appearing frequently at leading positions of strings, the program may become significantly slower."
   - **Threshold:** This invariant is particularly relevant when the branching factor is high because multiple letters need to be assigned digits in permutations, causing a combinatorial increase in recursive calls.

2. **Non-leading Zeros:**
   - **Invariant:** "If a significant number of strings have unique leading letters, especially if these letters must be assigned high-value digits, the recursive search space for viable digit assignments increases, potentially leading to slow performance."
   - **Threshold:** When considering strings with varied leading characters, especially if many are required to avoid leading zeros, this can compound the permutations explored by `dfs`.

3. **Balanced vs. Unbalanced Inputs:**
   - **Invariant:** "If the input strings have an unbalanced distribution of certain critical characters, leading to an uneven initial distribution of digit assignments, this can increase the number of recursive calls in `dfs`."
   - **Threshold:** This often becomes problematic when the distribution of character occurrences leads to a large number of initial assignment options that need to be explored recursively.

By identifying these conditions, we can better understand what input characteristics are likely to lead to performance bottlenecks and potentially guide optimizations or feature checks to prevent such scenarios from causing slowdowns.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
Petya has n positive integers a1, a2, ..., an. 

His friend Vasya decided to joke and replaced all digits in Petya's numbers with a letters. He used the lowercase letters of the Latin alphabet from 'a' to 'j' and replaced all digits 0 with one letter, all digits 1 with another letter and so on. For any two different digits Vasya used distinct letters from 'a' to 'j'.

Your task is to restore Petya's numbers. The restored numbers should be positive integers without leading zeros. Since there can be multiple ways to do it, determine the minimum possible sum of all Petya's numbers after the restoration. It is guaranteed that before Vasya's joke all Petya's numbers did not have leading zeros.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1 000) — the number of Petya's numbers.

Each of the following lines contains non-empty string si consisting of lowercase Latin letters from 'a' to 'j' — the Petya's numbers after Vasya's joke. The length of each string does not exceed six characters.

Output

Determine the minimum sum of all Petya's numbers after the restoration. The restored numbers should be positive integers without leading zeros. It is guaranteed that the correct restore (without leading zeros) exists for all given tests.

Examples

Input

3
ab
de
aj


Output

47


Input

5
abcdef
ghij
bdef
accbd
g


Output

136542


Input

3
aa
jj
aa


Output

44

Note

In the first example, you need to replace the letter 'a' with the digit 1, the letter 'b' with the digit 0, the letter 'd' with the digit 2, the letter 'e' with the digit 3, and the letter 'j' with the digit 4. So after the restoration numbers will look like [10, 23, 14]. The sum of them is equal to 47, which is the minimum possible sum of the numbers after the correct restoration.

In the second example the numbers after the restoration can look like: [120468, 3579, 2468, 10024, 3]. 

In the second example the numbers after the restoration can look like: [11, 22, 11].

assistant: ### Phase 3: Implement the Natural Language Invariants in C++

Based on the previously derived performance-characterizing invariants, we will implement C++ code that checks these conditions:

1. **Recursive Permutations and Branching Factor:**
   - **Checker Code:**

   ```cpp
   void check_dfs_invariant(int col, int activeBranches) {
       if (col > 10 || activeBranches > 10) {
           cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Non-leading Zeros:**
   - **Checker Code:** (This invariant checks if many strings require complex handling for leading digits)

   ```cpp
   void check_leading_zero_invariant(int uniqueLeadingChars) {
       if (uniqueLeadingChars > 8) {
           cerr << "Warning: leading_zero_invariant triggered - too many unique leading characters" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Balanced vs. Unbalanced Inputs:**
   - **Checker Code:** (This invariant checks for heavy recursive exploration due to unbalanced character distribution)

   ```cpp
   void check_unbalanced_input_invariant(int maxCharFrequency) {
       if (maxCharFrequency > 500) {
           cerr << "Warning: unbalanced_input_invariant triggered - unbalanced character distribution" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Integrate Checks into the C++ Program

Below is the instrumented C++ code implementing the solution with the checks:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
const int POW[] = {1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000, 10000000, 100000000, 1000000000};
int n;
int ans = 1000000000;
int ad[15];
char c[15];
bool vis[15];
bool n0[15];
string s[1005];

void cal_ad() {
    memset(ad, 0, sizeof(ad));
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        for (int j = s[i].size() - 1, k = 0; j >= 0; j--, k++) {
            ad[s[i][j] - 'a'] += POW[k];
        }
    }
}

void dfs(int col, int sum) {
    check_dfs_invariant(col, 10 - col); // Check for high recursion depth or branching factor
    if (col == 10) {
        ans = min(ans, sum);
        return;
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        if (!vis[i]) {
            vis[i] = true;
            dfs(col + 1, sum + ad[i] * col);
            vis[i] = false;
        }
    }
}

void cal_n0() {
    memset(n0, false, sizeof(n0));
    unordered_set<char> uniqueLeadingChars;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        n0[s[i][0] - 'a'] = true;
        uniqueLeadingChars.insert(s[i][0]);
    }
    check_leading_zero_invariant(uniqueLeadingChars.size()); // Check for too many unique leading characters
}

void read() {
    unordered_map<char, int> charFrequency;
    cin >> n;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        cin >> s[i];
        for (char c : s[i]) {
            charFrequency[c]++;
        }
    }
    int maxCharFrequency = 0;
    for (auto &entry : charFrequency) {
        maxCharFrequency = max(maxCharFrequency, entry.second);
    }
    check_unbalanced_input_invariant(maxCharFrequency); // Check for unbalanced character distribution
}

void solve() {
    cal_ad();
    cal_n0();
    memset(vis, false, sizeof(vis));
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        if (!n0[i]) {
            vis[i] = true;
            dfs(1, 0);
            vis[i] = false;
        }
    }
}

void print() { cout << ans << endl; }

int main() {
    read();
    solve();
    print();
}
```

### Explanation of Inserted Checks:
- **`check_dfs_invariant`:** This checks if the recursive depth (`col`) or the number of active branches exceeds an expected threshold, indicating a potential performance bottleneck due to excessive recursion.
- **`check_leading_zero_invariant`:** This checks if there are too many unique leading characters, which complicates digit assignments.
- **`check_unbalanced_input_invariant`:** This checks if the character distribution is too unbalanced, which could cause excessive exploration in the recursive search space. 

By placing these checks effectively, we can catch potential performance pitfalls without adding significant overhead to the critical sections of the program.
