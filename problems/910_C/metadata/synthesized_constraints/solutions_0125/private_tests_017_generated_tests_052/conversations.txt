system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

Petya has n positive integers a1, a2, ..., an. 

His friend Vasya decided to joke and replaced all digits in Petya's numbers with a letters. He used the lowercase letters of the Latin alphabet from 'a' to 'j' and replaced all digits 0 with one letter, all digits 1 with another letter and so on. For any two different digits Vasya used distinct letters from 'a' to 'j'.

Your task is to restore Petya's numbers. The restored numbers should be positive integers without leading zeros. Since there can be multiple ways to do it, determine the minimum possible sum of all Petya's numbers after the restoration. It is guaranteed that before Vasya's joke all Petya's numbers did not have leading zeros.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1 000) — the number of Petya's numbers.

Each of the following lines contains non-empty string si consisting of lowercase Latin letters from 'a' to 'j' — the Petya's numbers after Vasya's joke. The length of each string does not exceed six characters.

Output

Determine the minimum sum of all Petya's numbers after the restoration. The restored numbers should be positive integers without leading zeros. It is guaranteed that the correct restore (without leading zeros) exists for all given tests.

Examples

Note

In the first example, you need to replace the letter 'a' with the digit 1, the letter 'b' with the digit 0, the letter 'd' with the digit 2, the letter 'e' with the digit 3, and the letter 'j' with the digit 4. So after the restoration numbers will look like [10, 23, 14]. The sum of them is equal to 47, which is the minimum possible sum of the numbers after the correct restoration.

In the second example the numbers after the restoration can look like: [120468, 3579, 2468, 10024, 3]. 

In the second example the numbers after the restoration can look like: [11, 22, 11].

assistant: To diagnose the performance bottlenecks in the given C program, let's proceed through the phases specified:

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Comparing Line-Level Hit Counts:**
   - The `do-while` loop starting at line 24 and ending at line 33 is especially notable. The hit count for this loop is extremely high (3,628,799 for both inputs).
   - The `if` statement at line 25 and the `for` loop at line 29 within the `do-while` loop are executed many times, contributing to high hit counts.

2. **Pinpointing Problematic Lines:**
   - The line `if (starts[p[0]])` at line 25 runs once per permutation. Given that there are `10!` (3,628,800) permutations of the digits 0-9, this check is hit many times.
   - The `for` loop at line 29 iterates over all digits, performing the same number of accumulative operations on `curr`.

3. **Interacting with Data Structures:**
   - The program calculates the minimum sum by iterating over all permutations of digit assignments (0-9) and filtering out permutations that lead to leading zeros. This inherently leads to factorial time complexity.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the analysis, the slowdown stems from the computational cost of iterating over all permutations of digit assignments. Let's generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language:

1. **Exponential Growth Due to Permutations:**
   - **Invariant:** "The program enters a slow path when processing all permutations of a fixed set of elements (digits 0-9). This slowdown is exacerbated when there are constraints like avoiding leading zeros, as filtering permutations adds conditional checks on each permutation."
   - This invariant describes the factorial growth of permutations and the additional overhead of filtering, which leads to performance issues.

2. **High Cost of Filtering Permutations:**
   - **Invariant:** "The execution time significantly increases when many permutations need to be assessed against a constraint, such as avoiding starting digits from a particular set. This results in many permutations being evaluated but quickly discarded."
   - This invariant highlights the inefficiency introduced by checking the starting digit condition, which leads to frequent early exits in the loop.

3. **Complexity in Accumulative Calculations:**
   - **Invariant:** "If a high number of permutations are involved, and each permutation requires significant computational effort (like summing weighted contributions of digits), the performance degrades substantially."
   - This suggests the overhead from recalculating sums for each valid permutation.

### Conclusion

In summary, the primary performance bottleneck is rooted in handling permutations, which grows factorially with the number of elements (digits). The conditions to avoid leading zeros further increase the computational overhead. These performance-characterizing invariants capture scenarios that can lead to slow execution paths, providing insights into potential future slowdowns.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
Petya has n positive integers a1, a2, ..., an. 

His friend Vasya decided to joke and replaced all digits in Petya's numbers with a letters. He used the lowercase letters of the Latin alphabet from 'a' to 'j' and replaced all digits 0 with one letter, all digits 1 with another letter and so on. For any two different digits Vasya used distinct letters from 'a' to 'j'.

Your task is to restore Petya's numbers. The restored numbers should be positive integers without leading zeros. Since there can be multiple ways to do it, determine the minimum possible sum of all Petya's numbers after the restoration. It is guaranteed that before Vasya's joke all Petya's numbers did not have leading zeros.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1 000) — the number of Petya's numbers.

Each of the following lines contains non-empty string si consisting of lowercase Latin letters from 'a' to 'j' — the Petya's numbers after Vasya's joke. The length of each string does not exceed six characters.

Output

Determine the minimum sum of all Petya's numbers after the restoration. The restored numbers should be positive integers without leading zeros. It is guaranteed that the correct restore (without leading zeros) exists for all given tests.

Input

abcdef
ghij

g


Output

136542

Note

In the first example, you need to replace the letter 'a' with the digit 1, the letter 'b' with the digit 0, the letter 'd' with the digit 2, the letter 'e' with the digit 3, and the letter 'j' with the digit 4. So after the restoration numbers will look like [10, 23, 14]. The sum of them is equal to 47, which is the minimum possible sum of the numbers after the correct restoration.

In the second example the numbers after the restoration can look like: [120468, 3579, 2468, 10024, 3]. 

In the second example the numbers after the restoration can look like: [11, 22, 11].

assistant: ### Phase 3: Implementing Performance-Characterizing Invariants as Checker Code

Let's transform the natural language invariants into C++ checker code snippets:

#### Invariant 1: Exponential Growth Due to Permutations

```cpp
void check_permutation_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Permutation invariant triggered - excessive permutations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

#### Invariant 2: High Cost of Filtering Permutations

```cpp
void check_leading_zero_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Leading zero invariant triggered - excessive filtering" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

#### Invariant 3: Complexity in Accumulative Calculations

```cpp
void check_accumulation_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Accumulation invariant triggered - accumulation workload excessive" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrate Checkers into the Original Program

Now, integrate these checks at appropriate points in the original C++ code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

long long sum[10] = {0};
bool starts[10] = {0};
int p[10];

// Function to check permutation invariant
void check_permutation_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Permutation invariant triggered - excessive permutations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Function to check leading zero invariant
void check_leading_zero_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Leading zero invariant triggered - excessive filtering" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Function to check accumulation invariant
void check_accumulation_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: Accumulation invariant triggered - accumulation workload excessive" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
    int n;
    cin >> n;

    // Check if n is at its upper bound which might lead to excessive permutations
    check_permutation_invariant(n >= 10);

    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        string s;

**Comments on Checker Integration:**
- **Permutation Invariant Check:** This is placed right after input reading to catch potential excessive permutations before the costly loop.
- **Accumulation Invariant Check:** This is before entering the permutation loop to prevent unnecessary computations.
- **Leading Zero Invariant Check:** Directly checks the `starts` condition to ensure it doesn't drain performance with redundant filtering. 

These integrated checks will help identify and abort early if any of the performance bottleneck conditions are met.
