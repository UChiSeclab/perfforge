system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

Petya has n positive integers a1, a2, ..., an. 

His friend Vasya decided to joke and replaced all digits in Petya's numbers with a letters. He used the lowercase letters of the Latin alphabet from 'a' to 'j' and replaced all digits 0 with one letter, all digits 1 with another letter and so on. For any two different digits Vasya used distinct letters from 'a' to 'j'.

Your task is to restore Petya's numbers. The restored numbers should be positive integers without leading zeros. Since there can be multiple ways to do it, determine the minimum possible sum of all Petya's numbers after the restoration. It is guaranteed that before Vasya's joke all Petya's numbers did not have leading zeros.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1 000) — the number of Petya's numbers.

Each of the following lines contains non-empty string si consisting of lowercase Latin letters from 'a' to 'j' — the Petya's numbers after Vasya's joke. The length of each string does not exceed six characters.

Output

Determine the minimum sum of all Petya's numbers after the restoration. The restored numbers should be positive integers without leading zeros. It is guaranteed that the correct restore (without leading zeros) exists for all given tests.

Note

In the first example, you need to replace the letter 'a' with the digit 1, the letter 'b' with the digit 0, the letter 'd' with the digit 2, the letter 'e' with the digit 3, and the letter 'j' with the digit 4. So after the restoration numbers will look like [10, 23, 14]. The sum of them is equal to 47, which is the minimum possible sum of the numbers after the correct restoration.

In the second example the numbers after the restoration can look like: [120468, 3579, 2468, 10024, 3]. 

In the second example the numbers after the restoration can look like: [11, 22, 11].

assistant: ### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

By analyzing the hit counts, we can observe the following:

1. **Permutation Loop**: The lines related to the permutation and evaluation (`do` loop from line 17 to line 22) are hit extremely frequently, with 3,628,800 iterations for both the slow and fast inputs. However, the operations inside this loop (especially lines 19 and 20) show a significant difference in hits between the slow (2,177,280 hits) and fast inputs (1,451,520 hits).

2. **Computation of `res`**: The computation of `res` inside the permutation loop is affected heavily, with more iterations executed for the slow input compared to the fast input.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

**Natural Language Performance Invariants**:

1. **High Permutation Iterations**: "The program can slow down significantly if the number of feasible permutations is large. This occurs when many letter-to-digit mappings are possible due to varied use of leading letters and multiple digits having significant positional impact."

2. **Repeated Calculation Over Large Search Space**: "When the sum calculation involves a high number of digits with substantial positional impact, performance may be degraded by repeated summation operations across permutations."

3. **Leading Digit Constraints**: "Performance degradation can occur when many permutations must be skipped due to constraints on leading digits, increasing the amount of iteration over permissible configurations."

These invariants describe conditions where the code may slow down due to a large search space of permutations and constraints associated with the leading digits that need to be skipped. These are likely exacerbated by the characteristics of the slow input, which results in more permutations being evaluated due to the specific arrangement of letters and the constraints on leading digits. The key issue is the factorial growth of permutations, which is sensitive to the configuration of the problem's inputs.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
Petya has n positive integers a1, a2, ..., an. 

His friend Vasya decided to joke and replaced all digits in Petya's numbers with a letters. He used the lowercase letters of the Latin alphabet from 'a' to 'j' and replaced all digits 0 with one letter, all digits 1 with another letter and so on. For any two different digits Vasya used distinct letters from 'a' to 'j'.

Your task is to restore Petya's numbers. The restored numbers should be positive integers without leading zeros. Since there can be multiple ways to do it, determine the minimum possible sum of all Petya's numbers after the restoration. It is guaranteed that before Vasya's joke all Petya's numbers did not have leading zeros.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1 000) — the number of Petya's numbers.

Each of the following lines contains non-empty string si consisting of lowercase Latin letters from 'a' to 'j' — the Petya's numbers after Vasya's joke. The length of each string does not exceed six characters.

Output

Determine the minimum sum of all Petya's numbers after the restoration. The restored numbers should be positive integers without leading zeros. It is guaranteed that the correct restore (without leading zeros) exists for all given tests.

So after the restoration numbers will look like [10, 23, 14]. The sum of them is equal to 47, which is the minimum possible sum of the numbers after the correct restoration.

In the second example the numbers after the restoration can look like: [120468, 3579, 2468, 10024, 3]. 

In the second example the numbers after the restoration can look like: [11, 22, 11]. 

Solution (C++ code):
{solution}


assistant: ### Phase 3: Implement the Natural Language Invariants in C++

Based on the performance-characterizing invariants derived earlier, we will create C++ code snippets to check for those conditions at runtime:

1. **High Permutation Iterations**: Check if the number of permutations is large due to the number of distinct letters used.
   
   ```cpp
   void check_permutation_size_invariant(bool condition) {
       if (condition) {
           cerr << "Warning: permutation_size_invariant triggered - too many feasible permutations" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Repeated Calculation Over Large Search Space**: Check if the `sum` array suggests a high number of significant digits.

   ```cpp
   void check_digit_impact_invariant(bool condition) {
       if (condition) {
           cerr << "Warning: digit_impact_invariant triggered - high impact from multiple digits" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Leading Digit Constraints**: Check if the constraints on leading digits significantly affect permutations.

   ```cpp
   void check_leading_digit_invariant(bool condition) {
       if (condition) {
           cerr << "Warning: leading_digit_invariant triggered - excessive leading digit constraints" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Integrate Checker Code into the Original Program

Now let's integrate these checks into the original C++ program at appropriate points to monitor the bottlenecks:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
const int MAXD = 10;
int A[MAXD]{};
char buff[MAXD]{};
bool lead[MAXD]{};
int sum[MAXD]{};
int N, ret = 1E9;

// Function to check permutation size invariant
void check_permutation_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: permutation_size_invariant triggered - too many feasible permutations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Function to check digit impact invariant
void check_digit_impact_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: digit_impact_invariant triggered - high impact from multiple digits" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Function to check leading digit invariant
void check_leading_digit_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: leading_digit_invariant triggered - excessive leading digit constraints" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    scanf("%d", &N);
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        scanf(" %s", buff);
        for (int j = strlen(buff) - 1, t = 1; j >= 0; --j, t *= MAXD)
            sum[buff[j] - 'a'] += t;
        lead[buff[0] - 'a'] = true;
    }
    
    // Check for permutation size invariant
    int distinct_letters_count = std::count_if(sum, sum + MAXD, [](int x) { return x > 0; });
    check_permutation_size_invariant(distinct_letters_count > 8);
    
    // Check for digit impact invariant
    int significant_digit_count = std::count_if(sum, sum + MAXD, [](int x) { return x > 100; });
    check_digit_impact_invariant(significant_digit_count > 5);
    
    // Check for leading digit invariant
    int lead_constraints = std::count(lead, lead + MAXD, true);
    check_leading_digit_invariant(lead_constraints > 5);
    
    std::iota(A, A + MAXD, 0);
    do {
        if (lead[A[0]]) continue;
        int res = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < MAXD; ++i) res += i * sum[A[i]];
        ret = std::min(res, ret);
    } while (std::next_permutation(A, A + MAXD));
    
    printf("%d\n", ret);
    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation of Check Placement**:
- **Permutation Size Check**: Before executing permutations, we verify the count of distinct letters to determine if too many permutations could occur.
- **Digit Impact Check**: We look at the `sum` array for high values representing significant digits, placing this check after populating the `sum` array.
- **Leading Digit Constraints Check**: We count how many letters are required to avoid being leading digits, introducing this check after populating the `lead` array. 

These checks ensure we catch potential slowdowns related to permutations and constraints on letter-to-digit mapping during execution.
